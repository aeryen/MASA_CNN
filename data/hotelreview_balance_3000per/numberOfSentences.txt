80	dont beleive the good reviews , we were fooled too  ###  let me preface this review by apologizing for the length , but there are many things that needed to be mentioned  ###  being a young traveler (24 years old ) it does not take much to impress me , and excellence just did not live up to my expectations of a so called 5 star resort  ###  we arrived late because of an 8 hour american airlines delay and the punta cana airport was a circus of hundreds of people crammed to get to their bags  ###  the transfer to the hotel during the night was very bad  ###  the roads as is stated on this website numerous times are very bad  ###  when we finally arrived at around 10pm we were given a tour of the room  ###  when the employee proceeded to show us the minibar , it still had drinks from the previous occupants  ###  he yelled for another employee but quickly gave up and said we would get it changed in the morning  ###  we went to the only late night place to get food , a pizza place called oregano  ###  the pizza was good but we did learn something very quickly  ###  people were tipping the employees  ###  we were told all tips were included , but we decided to tip to not appear to be cheap  ###  the next morning we went to the buffet breakfast at tuscana , there were plenty of choices , not many of them all too good  ###  the choices i made were stale or just did not taste fresh  ###  the fruit juice was good but always warm  ###  after breakfast we headed to the beach , found a nice hut with a great view of a blue but very rough ocean  ###  the resort was not full at all so a lot of spots were open  ###  there were bartenders who worked hard to bring us drinks , but the beach was understaffed  ###  we went to the bar to get just as many drinks as we were served  ###  we met one very nice bartender kenny and he was what the other employees should be like  ###  anyways , we were approached everyday by salesmen soliciting off - site excursions on the beach  ###  they were rude and pushy and would not go away  ###  they are apparently allowed to walk the beach because it is public but when i later saw him holding an excellence pizza box i grew suspicious  ###  we tried to walk the beach a little , but in either direction are huts with vendors and when you walk past them on the beach they approach you ( harassing ) and tell you to come to their hut  ###  that was the first and last time we walked the beach  ###  we ate lunch at the grill which was average  ###  the burger did not taste good the best thing i had was the french fries  ###  we had dinner at spice the next night which was good , we ended up eating there twice  ###  the next morning we ate breakfast at the grill which was better than the buffet at toscana but still nothing impressive  ###  after spending the day at the beach we noticed that the room had been cleaned , but under further inspection the only thing that was done was the bed was made and the floors were mopped  ###  we also noticed that none of the towels were changed  ###  back to the room and its problems later , but the maid service here gets a huge f  ###  everyday something was wrong  ###  we tried the grill for dinner that night  ###  the steak was good but the mashed potatoes were cold  ###  we did not send it back but it ruined my dinner  ###  the deserts every night were the same 3-4 cakes and if you were lucky melted ice cream ( which tasted gross )  ###  every night after dinner we went to the lobby for the shows , which were better than expected  ###  however the saxophone player before the shows plays the same 5 songs every single night ( two of which are pretty woman and i want to hold your hand ) , it got so repetitive after awhile it became humorous  ###  the next morning we went to the grill for what turned out to be an interesting breakfast  ###  some of the tables along the edge of the restaurant had a nice ocean view  ###  we requested one of those tables , which happened to be dirty  ###  the hostess seemed confused but she sat us at a different table while she cleaned the other  ###  she was not overwhelmed because there were only 2 tables and 5 waiters plus her  ###  anyways , the table was cleared off , but we noticed she cleaned the wrong one , instead of cleaning the ocean view table , she clears off the table with a large wooden pole in front of it  ###  i told her that was not the one we wanted and she very obviously rolled her eyes at me and said something in spanish before cleaning the right table  ###  lunch at the buffet turned out to be even worse as both my girlfriend and myself got food poisoning and were up all night  ###  the food for lunch at the buffet was old , stale and terrible  ###  the next morning we decided to eat in being we were both recovering from being ill  ###  so we called into room service and ordered breakfast  ###  an hour passed and i called to check the status  ###  they told me it would be another 20-30 minutes  ###  i told them to cancel the order  ###  another day i tried to order room service for lunch at 11:15  ###  the woman on the phone told me i couldnt order lunch before 11:30  ###  i asked her if she could at least write the order down and have it sent once lunch was served  ###  she seemed confused and i didnt push for it  ###  in my 7 day stay we did not once actually get room service  ###  we headed to the beach and ate at the bbq they had on the beach which we discovered late into the trip  ###  because the resort is large , i would estimate the 90% who did not sit in the area of the bbq would not eat there  ###  now onto the problems with the room  ###  our toilet had a hard time flushing , sometimes appeared to be on the verge to overflow , the handles on the hot tub came off and did not work  ###  you needed to use your hand to turn the metal faucet  ###  the screen on the patio door was also bent  ###  the satellite tv went out several times per day , a problem not only experienced by us because i heard people speaking about it  ###  we also both got what appears to be bedbugs probably because they never changed the linens  ###  we continued to attempt to have fun and signed up for the snorkeling trip to catalina island  ###  we signed up for it at the excellence but it was not exactly run by them  ###  the two guides , miguel and franklin were extremely friendly and funny  ###  once we got to the boat we were surprised to see the condition of the docks and the boat  ###  the crew consisted of people who just sat there and did nothing but take our expensive excursion for free  ###  the double decker boat hit very bad waves on the way back , and as an experienced fisherman i can tell you that the captain did not know what he was doing  ###  our final day at excellence was a summation of the entire vacation  ###  after another hard night because of the food , we took a little more time to pack then expected  ###  we needed to meet in the lobby for our transfer to the airport at 11:30am  ###  we got to the lobby at 11:15am , just in time for a few minutes to grab a quick bite at the breakfast buffet  ###  we were shocked when after we sat ourselves a waiter came to us and told us that breakfast was over  ###  while he was saying this i am watching the other guests at the buffet getting their second and third helpings of food  ###  i told him we couldnt go to the sit down breakfast because our taxi was coming in only a few minutes  ###  
80	good , but not the best my wife and i stayed at excellence from 9/21-9/28  ###  we had both good and bad experiences there  ###  we are in our late 30's and have travelled to several places including all - inclusives and cruises  ###  we took this trip for our 15th wedding anniversary  ###  yes , you have to pay $10 dollars per person when you get there  ###  someone told us that you have to pay $20 to leave but we never did  ###  we had a private transfer arranged through ibk  ###  it was just the two of us on the van that was big enough for 8  ###  we skipped the porters and found them waiting for us  ###  our driver spoke limited english and we spoke limited spanish so there was not a lot of conversation on the ride  ###  this same guy picked us up on our day of departure , he was actually 30 minutes early picking us up  ###  weekend arrivals and departures are busier  ###  the roads leaving the airport and going to the hotel are not bad but the road between these two was kind of rough  ###  it did not seem as bad as everyone has said  ###  the ride took barely over an hour both ways  ###  arrival/check - in was strange  ###  it was like they did not know we were coming  ###  they had to hunt for wet towels , which we did not care about and it took them several minutes to find someone to get us the welcome drink  ###  the guy at the desk checking us in seemed distracted the whole time he was helping us , he kept calling different people on the phone  ###  our room was not ready , so we ended up eating lunch before heading up  ###  the room - when we arrived at the room our luggage had been delivered  ###  we were hoping/expecting flowers , fruit , and a banner for our anniversary but we did not get it during our stay  ###  no , we did not call because it was not a big deal , we just guessed that something got overlooked  ###  our room was an ocean view , which i do not suggest paying the extra money for  ###  we tried to book a swimout , which seemed like the best rooms to have , but there were none available at booking  ###  the amount of wash cloths and towels in your room upon arrival will not be the same later during the week  ###  we never ran out of bath towels but we seldom had hand towels or wash cloths  ###  if you want wash cloths during your stay , take some from the restrooms located next to the toscana or the one next to the martini bar they are replenished around 3-4pm  ###  our balcony door never locked and if you opened it , the air conditioner would not cut off like many have stated  ###  the maid or someone must have done something to the closet door during our stay because it closed when we first arrived but later during the week it would not close all the way  ###  i never knew what happend there  ###  we did have ants on our sink every day and the last two days we had some kind of bug that looked like roaches in the bathroom  ###  they would scurry when the lights were turned on  ###  the hotel - it is well taken care of , someone is constantly cleaning  ###  if it rains like it did on us be careful walking around on the tile floors between buildings  ###  i did ok walking in my flip flops but it was extremely slick in my running and dress shoes  ###  the pool and beach - they did a great job keeping everything clean around both  ###  we did experience some problems finding towels  ###  if you ca not find towels look at the club house or at the hut where they give diving lessons beside of the bar sol  ###  the main pool is kind of busy , the beach was not as busy , and the cascade pool was completely laid back  ###  this is where i would have liked to have a swim out room , building 1, 2, or 4 would have been great for us  ###  bar service around the main pool is hit and miss  ###  it seemed to be better around the sol bar than closer to cafe kafe  ###  most of the time i just went to the bar and had prompt service  ###  if you need food while you are at the pool , both of these bars have sandwiches and fruit in to go boxes  ###  they also have food at cielo , the bar next to the cascade pool  ###  at the beach we had one day where it was tough to figure out which chairs were empty  ###  we only got drink service on the beach once while we were there  ###  yes the water is rough in the ocean  ###  the food at the beach never seemed to be good to us  ###  the day that they made burgers , chicken , and sausages , we tried it and it all was under cooked  ###  note , when they tell you that they will be serving food at 12, they mean that they are going to start cooking it at 12  ###  we only saw someone delivering pizza once during our stay  ###  if you want pizza/food , go to the toscana and ask for a box at the back of the restaraunt where they make the pizzas  ###  the bars and service during the shows - great service at all of them  ###  the only strange thing is the fact that you never knew what size or type of glass they were going to serve you in  ###  at the same bar you would get 3 different sized glasses for the same drink  ###  it was no big deal , just odd  ###  to tip or not to tip , i have no answer for you  ###  i generally tried to tip , but at the shows when i would tip one of the servers , they never came back , maybe i was not tipping enough  ###  if you sit at a bar very long and tip the bartender , you will not be able to walk a straight line when you leave  ###  the shows and entertainment crew - not the best i have seen and not the worst  ###  the crew seemed to try hard , they even made valiant attempts during the 2  ###  5 days of rain to keep everyone entertained  ###  just remember this is a job to them , when it is time for them to get off work they do not want to hang out with you , they want/need to go rest  ###  we saw this at the disco one night  ###  the restaurants - chez isabelle , the french one , was ok  ###  it did not live up to the hype that everyone put into it  ###  our cream brulee was not smooth and creamy , it reminded me of rice pudding  ###  i think it was because it had been sitting in a warmer  ###  the service was a little lacking here  ###  agave , the mexican , was suprizingly good  ###  i had read some bad reviews and this was not the case with us  ###  the steak that i had there was impressive , slightly over cooked but very tender  ###  the service was over the top  ###  the grill was a real shock  ###  this was another restaurant that i had read bad reviews about  ###  i had the mixed grill because the server told me it was smaller portions , he lied  ###  it was generous portions and the beef was cooked perfectly  ###  the service was good here , not great but good  ###  
80	asyou 'd expect  ###  beware the timeshare sellers  ###  let me just start by saying this resort was exactly what we expected based on it?? 5 out of 6 star rating and reviews i had read on debbie?? dominican page and other sites  ###  there are two resorts here the melia caribe is geared towards the americans and english speaking customers while melia caribe tropical is geared towards the europeans  ###  from what i understand the main difference is the two have different check in lobbies , so the staff can speak that particular language  ###  everyone goes to the same beach , pools , restaurants , etc  ###  the resort is large and spread out over several acres  ###  the grounds are beautiful and well maintained  ###  the shuttle service can be a very slow , especially around dinner time , when everyone is trying to get to the restaurants  ###  sometimes , when it did come it was full  ###  flag down a golf cart and tip the driver a few bucks  ###  if they can take you to your destination they will  ###  food : our experience was good at each restaurant we went to : dominican , chinese , american , and french  ###  the steak at the french restaurant was out of this world  ###  i eat steak maybe twice a year , this was so good  ###  we did have a problem getting into our restaurants of choice  ###  we were not able to get into the japanese at all  ###  we did get the french twice though and did not hesitate to go back  ###  the buffet was good  ###  you have to remember that they are trying to appeal all sorts of nationalities  ###  all sorts of cheeses for breakfast ( french ) , lox and chips and salsa ( count me in  ###  ) , tons of fresh fruits and juices  ###  i did read about and experienced on our last day ?  ###  a bird in the fruit bin  ###  that grossed me out  ###  beach  pool : i read where people complained about the seaweed on the beach  ###  let me tell you , i live on the atlantic ocean and no one is allowed to touch ( clean up ) the seaweed because it is a ??atural resource?  ###  these people are out there every morning cleaning up the seaweed  ###  yes , there is some seaweed on the beach ?  ###  welcome to the ocean  ###  also , it is a public beach - expect tp be approached by locals  ###  the beach is clean and the water is warm ( but not overly , like the gulf of mexico ) yet refreshing  ###  the sand is beautiful , however , for some reason no seashells or rocks ( odd )  ###  not that , that is detrimental because you can go shoeless , on the beach where i live you need to wear beach shoes , lest you cut your feet  ###  the pools were beautiful and well maintained as well  ###  there is a swim up bar at the pool  ###  the kids loved that  ###  there is lots of shade for those who don?? want to spend the day in the sun  ###  the pools are crowded  ###  lots of water sports to keep you busy , entertainment : the entertainment basically begins at 10pm  ###  way too late for us , we were tired after a day in the sun and a big dinner  ###  at the towel ??eadquarters?  ###  at the pool you can get a schedule of events for the day  ###  there is something going on all of the time  ###  horseshoes , volleyball , dancing lessons , etc  ###  we did not do any of that , but it was nice to know you could if you wanted to  ###  there is also water aerobics at the pool every day  ###  that was a lot of fun  ###  non - motorized sports are included  ###  for example , we took out a catamaran  ###  the problem is you are supposed to have it for a certain duration of time but no one has a watch on them to know how long they have been out ( or were they just having too much fun  ###  so you may need to wait , even if you reserved something for a specific time  ###  don?? blame the staff , it?? not their fault  ###  we did parasailing right at the resort ( $85 for two ) which was so worth it  ###  the staff did an exceptional job  ###  i had never parasailed before and i was nervous but they did a great job  ###  shopping : twice a week the resort has local vendors  ###  you probably heard about them whereas you can bargain with them  ###  one day they are on the american side one day on the euro , check with the resort , they were there tuesday  thursday  ###  if you walk down the beach you can also find local vendors , they are like hawks looking for you though , i preferred the vendors at the hotel  ###  fyi their local stone , larimer comes in many different qualities  ###  see the stones at the euro gift shop so you are familiar with the stone and don?? expect real silver from any vendors  ###  my daughter bought a larimer bracelet from the gift ??ut?  ###  near the pool and the stone popped out within 5 minutes , unfortunately we were already home , or else i would have brought it back  ###  the gift shop on the euro side is larger and has much more to offer  ###  the water : 6 out of 8 of us were ill at one point  ###  basically we had the ??quirts?  ###  ? a day or so  ###  nothing that would ruin your vacation but make certain you have your medication of choice ( i prefer pepto bismal , my sister prefers imodium )  ###  one of the staff had the bartender fix me a local remedy with bitters , sprite , a little alcohol and who know what else  ###  it was gross but they only gave me a 1/2 cup and i felt better  ###  i was not so sick that it kept me from the pool ?  ###  i just set up next to the bathrooms ??ust in case?  ###  timeshare : it is amazing how they know if you have attended  ###  once you attend they know it and leave you alone  ###  find out in advance what is expected of you  ###  we were told if we sat through a 90 minute presentation , which was too much of my precious vacation time , so we bargained and received a $50 gift certificate ( my sister used her for parasailing , i used mine in the gift shop )  ###  once i told the salesman there was no way i would buy anything today and no way i would buy anything without researching customer feedback on the internet he lost interest in his sales pitch  ###  sounds good to me ?  ###  took my $50 gift cert and i was outta there  ###  
80	excellence high standards as usual my wife and i stayed at epc for 14 nights from 17 november to 01 december 2008  ###  we had a pool view room in building 2 on the first floor , overlooking the 2 pools with cascade waterfall  ###  other reviews of this hotel have provided all the information which people should need to assist in their choice , so the purpose of this review is to provide some personal thoughts and impressions about the resort and how we found it for our tastes  ###  we also include some notes of comparison with the two mexico excellence resorts which are very similar , but more modern  ###  i have added , at the end , some notes about punta cana airport for those who are traveling to the dominican republic for the first time  ###  the transfer to and from the airport took about 75 minutes  ###  in both directions we were transported by vip travel and the vehicles were modern , clean and air conditioned  ###  it was unfortunate that on arrival , a group of 8 people who were scheduled to travel on our minibus , didn?? turn up and we waited an hour before being transferred to another bus  ###  the roads in dominican republic leave a lot to be desired , with some sections having serious damage to the tarmac and many potholes  ###  but there is only one short section which is really bad and the drivers know how to avoid the worst bumps  ###  there were signs of this bad section being repaired and there is also evidence of a new road being built alongside , although i wouldn?? hold your breath for when it might be completed  ###  there is an alternative of a transfer by helicopter which costs ( i believe ) around us$75 per person each way  ###  your luggage must travel separately and meet you at the hotel  ###  our room ?  ###  was a good size , clean and with a very large , comfortable 4- poster bed  ###  the bathroom was fine and a good size , but we did miss the separate basins ( sinks ) ?  ###  in mexico we had his and hers basins  ###  also the shower , whilst fine and with plenty of power , was not as good as the walk - in showers in the mexico resorts  ###  but that?? just being a bit picky???  ###  we had swim - up room at both mexico resorts and the rooms there were larger and with a better balcony / patio and private grass area and a second outside jacuzzi  ###  having looked at the swim - up rooms at punta cana , we would not bother to pay the extra for one here  ###  the resort is , as always with excellence , beautifully furnished and maintained and the gardens are manicured to perfection  ###  epc has an advantage of being longer established than the mexico resorts , so the gardens are more mature and the trees and shrubs are larger  ###  for us , the outstanding feature of this resort is the beach  ###  we are not beach people , but this has converted us ( as long as we can find this quality )  ###  the sand is golden , soft , fine and clean ( unlike mexico )  ###  the sea is warm , clean and had wonderful waves for jumping in  ###  this is not a swimming beach ?  ###  if you want to swim in calm water , you need to walk a couple of hundred yards to the right ( when looking out to sea ) where the reef is further out and the waves are broken before they reach the shore  ###  there is a system of warning flags for those wishing to go in the water  ###  there are one or two life guards on duty all day and they are very observant and attentive  ###  there is a black flag at each end of the patrolled area and when the sea is rougher they prefer people to stay together in the centre  ###  when red flags are flying people can go in the water with care , but non swimmers should stay fairly shallow , because the waves are strong and there is quite an undertow when the water flows in and out  ###  we had red flags every day except 2 stormy days when we had black flags and swimming was not allowed  ###  people were in the water on all except black flag days  ###  it was great fun if you like sea bathing  ###  the beach is raked every morning and there are plenty of sunloungers under palm trees and palapas  ###  there are frequent visits from staff taking orders for drinks and at lunchtime a guy comes around the beach ( and pool area ) offering pizzas  ###  in addition in good weather there is a ??ook out?  ###  on the beach ?  ###  of paella , or a dominican dish , or a barbeque  ###  in addition packs of sandwiches can be obtained from sol bar  ###  and don?? forget the soft ice cream dispenser around the side of kaf? caf? bar???  ###  so much choice???  ###  the pool areas are kept very clean and the pools are beautiful  ###  there are plenty of sun loungers , the swim - up bar and sol bar provided excellent service  ###  there are 2 separate pools surrounded by buildings 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5  ###  they tend to be quieter ?  ###  partly because there is less shade in that area  ###  there is a small ??ibrary?  ###  english language and other language books in the clubhouse at the back of the beach and in the sports bar ( also , we believe in the excellence club )  ###  there are several gift and souvenir shops and a pharmacy outside the front entrance near to the attractive nature walk area  ###  we should add that all staff in this resort are friendly , smiling and helpful  ###  on the few occasions when problems occurred , we heard that they were dealt with promptly and efficiently  ###  the restaurants are very similar in all 3 resorts and as usual there was a dinner choice from at least six out of the eight possible restaurants every evening  ###  on only two occasions did we have to wait for a table ?  ###  they provide a ??leeper?  ###  carry with you whilst you are at the bar  ###  we ate in chez isabelle ( french ) , spice ( asian / japanese ) , toscana ( italian ) , barcelona ( mediterranean ) , the grill ( steaks ) and the lobster house ( self explanatory )  ###  our favourite was the french with the japanese a close second  ###  the only disappointment was the lobster house ?  ###  but that was because we just don?? happen to like caribbean lobster , having previously been spoiled by atlantic lobster ( as found in new england )  ###  we did not try the mexican restaurant ( agave ) , nor the pizza /pasta restaurant , although we heard good reports of the former  ###  most evenings there was an alternative barbeque offered on the plaza outside the theatre  ###  lunch restaurants were at an amazing buffet in toscana , or at the grill where the food is from a menu and served to the table  ###  breakfast is from another outstanding buffet in toscana or with service in the lobster house ( not a lobster menu  ###  there are 7 bars ( from memory ) all offering a good range of quality alcohols and soft drinks  ###  our main difficulty was that there is no peaceful bar in the evening  ###  the four open bars are all around the theatre area and are swamped by the extremely loud music from the entertainment , making conversation difficult or impossible  ###  the sports bar has a large screen tv so that is not a quiet haven either  ###  some shows may not appeal to your taste and for those staying longer than 7 days , you may not wish to see the weekly cycle a second time anyway  ###  it would be good to be able to retreat to a quiet place with new friends and have a conversation  ###  although some of the entertainment was ok for us ( it must be impossible to cater for all tastes ) it was regrettable that the comp?re?? many announcements and all music were played at such a high volume  ###  we thought for a while that there must have been a convention of people who are hard of hearing???  ###  apart from the main shows there is an excellent saxophonist who plays very well , but still finds it necessary to play directly into a microphone and through huge speakers , thus destroying the subtlety of his music  ###  similarly the music played outside on the plaza in some early evenings ?  ###  but at least the sound is muted in the open air  ###  we did wander down to the disco one evening and enjoyed the night club atmosphere and some dancing  ###  now in a location like that , loud music is permitted if not essential  ###  by comparison , both the excellence resorts in mexico have a quieter bar area where one can avoid the entertainment if wished  ###  
80	es bahia principe  ###  just returned this morning from a great week with my boyfriend at bahia principe  ###  their theme song is still stuck in my head  ###  this is my bf 's 3rd time at an all - inclusive and my 2nd so i now have one previous experience to compare to  ###  considering just the resort itself , bahia principe was much better than breezes jibacoa in cuba , which i would now re - rate as 3 out of 5 stars  ###  i do have a lot to say so please bare with me  ###  we booked online through sunwing vacations  ###  my impression of sunwing is not that great after this trip  ###  the beginning and end of the trip was horrible because neither the travel agent nor sunwing told us when we booked the trip that santo domingo , where we landed , is a 3+ hours drive to punta cana  ###  beware of this  ###  when we complained to our sunwing rep at the resort , he told us that it should have been the travel agent 's responsibility  ###  anyway , we probably ended up travelling 8 hours total from the airport to the resort and back  ###  returning to santo domingo was not too bad because it was afternoon and there were things to see and businesses were open  ###  but on the way there , we landed in the evening around 8:30pm and so the 4- hour drive was in complete darkness as the streets were pitch black  ###  our guide did not seem friendly and was clear that he did not like speaking english  ###  he said 2 hours to santo domingo and kept quiet pretty much the rest of the trip , so after 2 hours we were not sure where he was taking us  ###  anyway , it was a horrible start to a vacation  ###  in general : imo , punta cana is a place to go for sun , beach , and relaxing  ###  it is not your best choice for sightseeing  ###  in contrast , cuba ( havana ) had plenty of culture and sightseeing  ###  bahia principe is a big resort  ###  like previous reviews have mentioned , the trains that take you around are efficient and i never had to wait more than a few minutes  ###  room : we were upgraded for free to the club premier which is as far as it gets from the beach , but quite close to the central area of the resort with the lobby and pueblo principe  ###  perks included our own buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner ( smaller than the main buffet ) , our own pool with swim - up bar , and our own snack bar which had different and better food than any other snack bar  ###  because we were on the 2nd floor , we had no bug and ant problems  ###  our friends on the ground floor did have bugs in their room  ###  everything in the room was clean and quite well - kept  ###  bedsheets , bathroom and shower were all clean and white  ###  but i do agree with a previous review that for some reason , they seemed to ignore the bathroom mirror  ###  the shower had no curtain but a piece of glass that covers only half the tub and does not slide - this caused a slight flooding in the bathroom because no matter how careful i was , water would always spray all over the floor  ###  amenities included toiletries , hair dryer , mini - bar , coffee , a big umbrella ( which came into good use on our first day )  ###  there was no iron or ironing board  ###  the safe is $32 us for the week but a definite must - have  ###  our tv cable was broken and ripped when we arrived but a quick call and it was fixed promptly  ###  there were a few good english channels on tv  ###  nice sitting area and balcony , though our balcony view was barren land because we were on the edge of the resort  ###  unlike a previous review that said $2 a day was not enough , we tipped $2 us per day and everyday our maid decorated the bathroom with flowers and made us towel animals  ###  service : top - notch  ###  everyone was so polite and did everything with a smile  ###  reception , guest services , servers , bartenders , housekeeping , everyone i can remember tried to make our experience enjoyable  ###  a simple hola and smile from you will always be followed with an hola and smile  ###  my only negative experience was in the club premier lobby  ###  the man at the reception charged me incorrectly for my safe rental  ###  when i returned to point it out to him , he was not apologetic and returned my money with an angry demeanor and without a word  ###  buffet  a la carte : keep in mind you are in the dominican republic  ###  they do not get the food we get fresh in canada or in whatever country you 're from  ###  considering that , i found their food to be decent - definitely better than edible , which was my description for the food at breezes jibacoa in cuba  ###  the buffet is quite repetitive but the made - to - order omelettes at breakfast , made - to - order pastas at lunch , and dessert waffles at dinner were always delicious  ###  you 'll find your favourite dishes for the week  ###  we went to 4 a la cartes ( instead of 3 because we were upgraded ) - le gourmet ( punta cana side ) , japanese ( bavaro side ) , bbq ( at beach outdoors ) , seafood ( close to beach )  ###  le gourmet was successfully french - styled  ###  but again it is food in the dr , so my filet mignon was more like a rib eye and the souffle was really a brownie  ###  however the presentation was beautiful  ###  i was not as impressed with the japanese as many others seemed to be in these reviews  ###  there was no teppanyaki show - he simply cooked the food in front of us with some banging of his tools and the grill  ###  everything was dry and overcooked except the shrimp which was fabulous  ###  deep fried ice cream was ok  ###  do not go to bbq  ###  this is nothing more than buffet with a few bbq features - which you might find at regular lunch or dinner buffet anyway  ###  seafood was my favourite of the 4  ###  there was an appetizer buffet which had an excellent selection  ###  my boyfriend had a 1/2 lobster for his entr?e , which actually had some texture ( unlike the mushy lobster in the paella ) , and i had some decent salmon filets  ###  public areas : the lobbys of both the bavaro and punta cana sides were beautiful  ###  there is plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy a drink and lots of lounge chairs too where i saw many ppl take naps  ###  the gardens and grounds are so well - kept and well - groomed  ###  i think they cover every detail of cleanliness that you can think of - i saw workers waxing the marble floor in the lobby , polishing railings , cleaning chair cushions , scrubbing beach chairs  ###  i was very impressed with this  ###  pueblo principe : this little town has something for everybody  ###  plenty of shops for beach stuff , cigar and alcohol , jewellery , casino ( penny , nickel , quarter slots , some table games and 1 texas holdem table ) , pool tables , internet , piano/karaoke bar , disco (12-2am ) , nighttime burger joint (10pm -6/7am ) , and vendors - hahah these guys are good  ###  if you really do not want to talk to them , just politely say no and walk away  ###  one guy tried every trick in the book to try to get my boyfriend to buy some jewellery for me and my boyfriend was trying to be polite and not walk away  ###  he said the original price was $105 but would give it to us for $50 - we ended up talking him down to $18 but we still did not buy it because we did not think it would be real larimar from a vendor like that  ###  it was good entertainment though hahah  ###  all food and drink is included except for casino  ###  poolsthe water is very clear all the time  ###  of course there will be some dirt and sand with all the ppl that go in and out  ###  there are missing tiles here and there and maintenance of the pool physically is so - so  ###  there are always plenty of pool chairs  ###  the big fountain and the bridges at the beach pool add a nice touch  ###  the club premier pool was a nice perk for the free upgrade because it was much quieter than the main pools and has a swim - up bar  ###  
80	beautiful grounds - service spotty - wedding details included my husband and i were married in june 2008 at the gran bahia principe in punta cana  ###  we had a rather large number (44) of guests attending the wedding and staying at the resort  ###  we stayed for 9 nights and had guests that stayed as short as 3 days and as long as 7 days  ###  resort : the resort is rather large and parts of it are currently under construction  ###  the lobby driveway was being remodeled and if you tried to use the punta cana side of the lobby during the day , it was absolutely horrible  ###  also , i?? sure the staff was doing harm to their hearing , and their nerves , as they tried to cope with working in such an environment  ###  most of the construction is not at all noticeable except for the fact that their numerous clubs ( golden , diamond , ambar , etc  ###  ) are very confusing with everyone mingled in together due to the construction  ###  i?? still not 100% sure of what each of the clubs meant except that the ambar section was adults - only and a little quieter and nicer than the other sections  ###  the grounds are absolutely beautiful and perfectly maintained  ###  the pools and decks are cleaned at night and the pools were always in wonderful condition  ###  the main pool near the beach was always very crowded  ###  the quietest pools were in either the ambar , or diamond areas as there were always plenty of umbrellas and chairs at these pools  ###  the rooms were nice with a sitting area , bed and balcony  ###  the bathrooms had jet tubs and were marble and tile  ###  the bathrooms in the ambar section are a little nicer with a separate walk - in shower , toilet area and tub  ###  the spa was very nice  ###  we had the ??elaxing?  ###  couples massage and it was definitely relaxing  ###  we also used the water therapy area  ###  it was the neatest thing i??e seen  ###  it had two big pools ?  ###  one slightly warmer that the other with all kinds of different bubbles and massaging options  ###  there was also a small and very cold ??ool?  ###  there were also saunas and steam rooms with different temperatures  ###  it had several types of showers including a rain shower , bucket , and a therapeutic ( my favorite )  ###  however , the prices are comparable to the u  ###  and aren?? a really great bargain ( $72 usd each for a couples massage  ###  the service at some of the restaurants was definitely lacking and spotty at times  ###  sometimes the service was wonderful and sometimes you were begging to get a drink while you sat at you table  ###  we ate at the bbq restaurant which is on the beach and has made to order steaks , pork chops etc , a salad bar and dessert bar  ###  the service here was quite good both times we ate there and you were able to enjoy the sounds of the ocean  ###  we also ate at the italian restaurant , which was quite good , and the service wasn?? at all bad here  ###  there was a salad and appetizer bar including a bruschetta bar , salad bar , tomato bisque , carpaccio , olives , and other ??talian?  ###  you then chose a main course  ###  the pizza was quite good at the italian restaurant  ###  the lobster pasta was relatively good  ###  some of the seafood options at the italian restaurant were mediocre  ###  the seafood restaurant?? appetizers were wonderful and included fried fish , calamari , steamed shrimp , shrimp cocktail , and a seafood soup  ###  the main dishes were not that good and we saw several other families just having the appetizers and salad for dinner  ###  we also tried out the garden grill , which was wonderful both times we ate there  ###  the skirt steak was delicious and the ??ouisiana corn chowder?  ###  the dessert bar throughout the restaurants was pretty much the same and relatively good  ###  the bananas drizzled in chocolate , fruit selection , ice cream , and mouse were all quite good  ###  the main buffet was quite good and although it did get a little repetitive , everything was still above average for an all - inclusive resort  ###  reservations were hard to come by ( you have to make them in person at guest services , though some of our family said they were able to call to make them ) and i recommend getting them as soon as you get to the resort  ###  if they insist that the only thing that?? available is bbq or nothing at all , just ask nicely again  ###  you can also come back later , sometimes there are cancellations and you can get squeezed in  ###  the drinks at the bars are very sweet and usually quite weak  ###  however , we often times asked the bartenders to add more alcohol and they always complied  ###  the best mixed drink we had while there was the capirinia  ###  it?? very similar to a mojito , but , with lots of fresh lime instead of the mint  ###  the margaritas were also quite good  ###  in general , the drinks at the lobby bars were much better , and stronger , than those by the pool area  ###  maybe the resort is trying to save us from ourselves by making the drinks by the pool and beach a little weaker  ###  i think that some of the inadequate service was just due to growing pains that the resort is feeling since it is expanding and growing so rapidly  ###  it also definitely has a big resort feel where you just feel like you are just another number  ###  wedding : well , the actual events leading up to the wedding were the biggest disappointment of our trip  ###  the actual wedding itself went off just fine  ###  however , everything leading up to it was so unnecessarily stressful  ###  leading up to the big event , we tried to stay in contact with the resort and understand what we needed to decide in advance , however , it was nearly impossible to get in contact with anyone via email or phone  ###  when we did get in contact with the resort , we were told we need to make a lot of decisions ( restaurants , cakes , flowers ) as far in advance as possible  ###  however , the follow - up information was never sent to us  ###  at one point we were told to provide our documentation ( birth certificates , single affidavit , etc  ###  ) in advance , however , it ended up that we were suppose to provide this when we actually arrived at the resort  ###  when we faxed in our deposit for the wedding (9 months in advance ) we reserved the restaurants , however , when we got there those weren?? available and we went with the bbq for the rehearsal dinner and the garden grill for the reception  ###  ( both restaurants turned out fine and the food was delicious  ###  we went through ??edo?  ###  wedding documentation to get all of our paperwork in order for the wedding  ###  they were so easy to work , very responsive and had a very quick turn around  ###  we got to the resort , had lunch and then went immediately to check with the wedding coordinator  ###  we were scheduled to meet with her the next evening at 5 ( two days before the wedding  ###  at the meeting we picked flowers , cake ( chocolate or vanilla ) , menus etc  ###  we were told the wedding would be at 11 am instead of 4 pm  ###  this is the hottest time of the day and there is no shade at the wedding gazebo  ###  we were quite insistent that we have the 4 pm time instead since that was what our deposit said that was the best time for us  ###  the coordinator did not admit that there was a scheduling mistake with the judge until we found the form we sent in and pressed the issue  ###  she then said there was a scheduling mistake  ###  she then said she?? try to schedule a different time with the judge if his schedule allowed  ###  up until 5:30 the day before the wedding , the time was still up in the air  ###  
80	safe was stolen first , let me start by saying that i would have given this resort an excellent rating had our safe not gotten stolen  ###  it was our honey moon and this resort is absolutely beautiful and the staff is wonderful  ###  we booked our vacation through apple vacations , nothing special  ###  just knew a lot of people who used them  ###  we stayed in room 2371, close to the pool and one row back from the beach  ###  it was a nice location , but apparently someone had an eye on our room  ###  we checked in on monday 4/14 and were scheduled to leave on sunday 4/20  ###  well , on saturday 4/19 we left our room at 1:30 to go to eat , swim , and lay on the beach for our last day  ###  we returned to the room at 4:30 and noticed that someone had taken a crowbar and stolen the whole safe out of our room  ###  in our safe was all our money , credit cards , cell phones , jewelry , and passports  ###  we immediately contacted the front desk and they were at the room within minutes  ###  we also called our apple rep  ###  who was at the resort at the time ( carlos ) and he basically said that he spoke with his boss and said it was not their problem and that we would have to take it up with the hotel  ###  he never even called to check on us after all this happened to see if we were okay  ###  he was a waste of our time  ###  the hotel immediately took over and made sure we were taken care of  ###  they sat down with us to cancel all our credit cards and cell phones and helped us contact the us embassy in santo domingo to find out what we needed to do about getting new passports  ###  the embassy informed us that we would not be able to leave as scheduled the next day since we did not have passports and told us we would have to go to the embassy to get new ones  ###  so , the hotel scheduled for a security guard ( castro ) and a guy from guest servies ( james ) to drive us 4 hours to santo domingo to get new passports on monday  ###  the ride was really long and extremely bumpy , but we did get to learn a lot about the dr  ###  while we were gone , katty in guest services worked on our airline tickets to get those transferred so we could leave on tuesday  ###  in the meantime , between sat  ###  and tuesday , the hotel did everything they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible  ###  they took us to the store on the property and told us to get whatever we needed and they also gave us some cash so we could do whatever we wanted  ###  they also scheduled for us to have dinner at the restaurants that require reservations for the next three nights  ###  on tuesday morning before we left , we met with the director of the hotel and he gave us cash ( more than the value of the items in our safe ) and a free 7 night vacation to any of their resorts in the caribbean or mexico  ###  so , all in all everything turned out just fine and this could have happened to anyone staying at any resort  ###  if you would like details of the resort : check in : when we arrived at the hotel we were greeted right away and given a frozen drink while we checked in  ###  they origninally put us in room 1066, which was right beside the construction  ###  we walked to our room and the bellboys brought our bags to our room by golf cart about 5 min  ###  the room really was not that bad , but i requested a room change because i wanted to be closer to the other two iberostar resorts ( dominicana and punta cana )  ###  the next day they moved us to 2371, which was right the middle of everything  ###  room : the rooms are very spacious , but my only complaint was the extra small bathrooms  ###  the shower was a good size and it has a separate tub , but the toliet area was super small  ###  so small in fact i do not know how a larger person could fit in there  ###  our a/c worked great and we did not really have any bad smells like other people have said  ###  we tipped our cleaning lady everyday until our room got broken in to and left her notes as to what we needed  ###  if you can , try to book an upstairs room  ###  most of the sliding glass doors will pop right open if you lift it up and pull on them  ###  kind of scary if you are on the bottom floor ( like we were ) and we think that is how they got into our room to steal our safe  ###  restaurants : we made our reservations the day we got to the hotel  ###  it is much easier to make them right away so you make sure you get to eat where you want  ###  we were supposed to only have 2 reserved dinners since we were oringinally staying 6 nights  ###  we asked if we could have another one and they had no problem giving it to us  ###  the hotel gave us three extra dinners after everything that happened , so we ate at the restaurants 6 out of 8 nights  ###  we had the gourmet twice ( amazing food  ###  must try the filet ) , the japanese twice ( definitely a must eat ) , mexican was pretty good , and jumbalaya/cajun was average ( they did have a good sirloin though )  ###  on one of the nights we did not have reservations , we ate at soft rock cafe which is like a sports bar and it serves american fare food  ###  i must say that it was pretty good  ###  the other night we ate at the buffet  ###  it was tropical night and it was terrible  ###  we had a really hard time finding something than even looked appealing  ###  they did have a guy in the corner who would make you a ribeye , which it what we ended up eating  ###  as for food during the day , we usually ate by the pool and there was always a variety of food  ###  you can always find something to eat there  ###  you have to realize that you are in another country and foods do taste different , so just enjoy being able to experience something different  ###  we heard some people say they had upset stomachs , but it did not seem to affect us any  ###  pool : the pool is really big and it has a swim up bar  ###  we spent a lot of our time there  ###  the staff that works at that bar have so much fun singing and dancing the whole time , while having a drink with you  ###  there are a lot of kids in the main part of the pool , but there are not as many on the bar side of it  ###  tips : we tipped all the time  ###  the cleaning lady , bartenders , waiters and people at reception who helped us  ###  the resort also has golf carts that will take you anywhere you want to go around the resort  ###  we took them a bunch and we tipped a $1 or $2 every ride  ###  beach : the beach here is just gorgeous  ###  white sand beach , clear blue water , and a nice breeze to keep you cool  ###  we never really had a problem find beach chairs and we usually layed on the beach near the little snack bar  ###  usually everyday around 4 or 5 there is a wedding on the wedding right near the snack bar  ###  it 's pretty cool to watch  ###  there topless women on the beach  ###  they are pretty much everywhere , laying out , walking down the beach , etc  ###  after you see it a couple of times it 's no big deal  ###  excursion : we booked the marinarium tour through the apple rep at the resort  ###  you board a catamaran and ride around for about 20 min and they take you to a roped off area in the ocean  ###  you jump off the boat and swim over to the blocked off area that has nurse sharks and stingrays  ###  this was so awesome  ###  the sharks and stingrays were about 3 or 4 feet below you  ###  take an underwater camera , you would not want to miss these pictures  ###  it was a great experience and would do it over again in a heartbeat  ###  
80	average , not excellence , with poor food my wife and i went to excellence punta cana june 14th - june 22nd  ###  to give everyone some brief background i have been to many caribbean islands and all - inclusive resorts including sandals ( st  ###  lucia , whitehouse in jamaica , ocho rios ) , aventura spa palace , and cayman islands  ###  i will breakdown the negatives and positives below , but my overall impression and time at excellence was just average/ok , with the food ok to poor , with the only positive being the beauty of the resort and the beach  ###  i will try keep it simple , as other reviews pretty much give all the detailspositives : 1  ###  landscaping - beautiful with gorgeous views and palm trees everywhere  ###  great garden trail with flamingos , peacocks , chickens , birds , native plants , geese , and talking parrots  ###  but the thing is all the resorts i have been to have beautiful landscaping so it was no different then any other resort , and some other resorts have had even more impressive lobbies and landscaping  ###  beach : probably one of the best beaches i have been to  ###  very large , and long beach which you could take a 2 mile walk either way , and clear blue water  ###  yes , the water can be rough at times , with a strong undertoe , but it 's not too much worse than that seen on the east coast of the usa in the atlantic ocean  ###  if you walk 500 yards or so down to the right you will find very calmer water  ###  it is a really scenic walk  ###  my wife and i had a fun time jumping and surfing the waves  ###  only downfall was there is no beautiful sunsets as the sun sets on the other side of the island  ###  really ca not do too many motorized sports on the water due to the rough water , but some people took out kayaks  ###  the lifeguards are out watching everyone , with restricted areas to swim due to rough water  ###  the time we were there was red flagged ( meaning take your own risks while swimming ) , but it really was not all that bad , just be cautious and do not swim out far , and try to swim with a buddy if not such a great swimmer  ###  the beach has a great breeze which takes off the heat and feels good , watch for sunburn though  ###  pools : beautiful  ###  they have 2 pools  ###  the main pool which pretty much winds thru the most of the resort , and a 2nd smaller cascade/waterfall pool , which is more quiet and relaxing  ###  the main pool has many huts which you can lay on a bed or chairs , and to keep out of the sun if you get too burned  ###  make sure to wear lots of sunscreen the first few days as you can get burned easily  ###  try to reserve the huts early before breakfast as many guests reserve them early , grab a towel or book and place them on your chair or bed  ###  each day they always have activities including volleyball , aerobics , spanish lessons , dance classes , horse back riding , and other fun games with the entertainment crew  ###  check out the daily entertainment board and/or the excellence newsletter which the maids should drop of each evening in your room for turn down service  ###  staff : very friendly  ###  the staff always appreciated a dollar here and there for a good job the entertainment crew does a great job to keep people entertained  ###  the bartenders and pool service staff were great as well , they were always coming around with drinks and fresh baked pizza??  ###  domingo the sax player was great and i enjoyed listening to him play before and after dinner  ###  gym : this was nice  ###  looks like they just renovated the gym  ###  also nice hidden hut near gym and tennis courts that had a bar and pool tables , ping pong , foose ball , darts , archery , and so on  ###  fun to play before dinner  ###  drinks : were great , you really can?? mess up alcoholic drinks to bad  ###  try the cocoloca  ###  bring bug spray with deet , but never had any real problems with mosquitoes  ###  food : next to relaxing and hanging by the pool and beach , food is probably one of the most important aspects of a vacation to me  ###  excellence states that they have 5 star food , well this is not true and it really made me mad that excellence mis - represents their menu  ###  i am not kidding , many menu items are not served as described , and i don?? believe this is a server error , it is just that the resort created a menu to look good , but doesn?? always give you what you ordered , plus the quality of most of the food was poor to terrible  ###  examples i ordered an italian canoli and got a chocolate bar filled with pudding , and every time i ordered an argula or spinach salad they gave me romaine lettuce , and the little english the server could talk said ??es this is spinach , and that was the only lettuce they had here?  ###  obviously it was not spinach , the resort mis - represented a lot of their food from what their menu?? state  ###  my wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp ( but no crab ) , many dishes were missing specific recipes such as bacon , cheeses , veggies  ###  the staff were polite , but they really need better english speaking skills since they are serving to mostly english speaking guests in an americanized resort  ###  i appreciate their language and i was motivated to learn spanish and used it a lot while on the resort , but their was a huge language barrier at dinner service with most staff only speaking very little english and others speaking no english and looked clueless when you ordered your food  ###  i ordered chicken pad thai and got shrimp pad thai , told the server i was allergic to shrimp and he smiled and walked away and did not come back b/c he had no idea what i said  ###  had to track down the manager to change my order  ###  dinner service most nights were a mess  ###  the fact that many of the dinner dishes were incorrect and the staff waiters knew little english made dinner a diseaster if something was wrong with your dish , b/c there was no way to explain this to your server , they didn?? have a clue what you were saying  ###  the fish was absolutely terrible , you would think it?? be great on an island , well not so  ###  the only ok food was the grill ( just the steaks ) , beach bbq?? were good , and the pizza?? were great  ###  there was no restaurant that stood out to me b/c it was hit or miss , and when it was a hit , it was just average  ###  you would think with an executive chef from germany it would be a little better  ###  the buffets were bad , and always gave me an upset stomach and many guests i talked to also agreed the food was average and many had upset stomachs  ###  my wife got really bad stomach pains and probably had some sort of food poisoning  ###  the coffee was not good either  ###  and every morning we asked for a cappucino the machine was broken and could not get one  ###  the only ok buffet food was the fresh omelette and pasta stations , or any station that cooked freshly made chicken or steaks  ###  the pizza?? were probably the best food there  ###  the chaffing dishes/food on the buffet were soggy , and did not look fresh  ###  the resort would have buffet dinners on some nights , but it usually was leftover food from the lunch service  ###  i would just stick with freshly cooked meat  ###  if you are a food person i would avoid this resort  ###  they need major improvement in the quality of their food and they need to represent their menu?? and serve you what is stated  ###  the food at other all - inclusives i have been to has 10x better food  ###  room service : arrived within a decent time , but food was soggy and cold  ###  arrival : ride from the airport to the resort was very very bumpy , with poor roadways in much need of repair  ###  i tolerated this ok as i do not get motion sickness , but my wife felt ill after the ride  ###  the ride was about 1 1/2 hours  ###  rooms : the rooms were average at best  ###  i??e seen much better rooms at other resorts with much better maintained  ###  the jacuzzi drain did not work correctly , constantly draining the water , the toilet leaked and did not always flush , and the shower constantly leaked water  ###  the caulking around the shower walls were terrible and needed maintenance  ###  the furniture was just ok , and looked old and needed updating  ###  the mini - bar was nice , always kept full with beer , water , sodas  ###  the maid service was hit or miss , some days it was done on time , other days it was forgotten  ###  the beds were hard , and my wife and i had some back pain the first couple of days , but we tolerated it the rest of the week , but the bed could??e been much better  ###  maids need to leave more wash/face towels , they were rarely replaced  ###  room has safe which was nice to keep valuable , but this is nothing special and can be found at any resort  ###  
80	nothing spectacular my boyfriend and i visited the excellence from december 26th to january 2nd , 2008  ###  we had the excellence club junior swim - up suite  ###  i typed a thorough review that i hope all those looking to visit the resort will read  ###  we went as a very objective pair and this is simply what we found  ###  trip to and from the airportwe booked a private taxi to take from the airport  ###  the roads really are as bad as the reviews all say , and i 've traveled on some pretty bad roads in the west indies  ###  both boyfriend and i were quite nauseous by the time we pulled up to the excellence  ###  if you can afford it , i suspect that helicopter travel is the way to go  ###  we considered doing that on the way back but learned too late that bags must be transferred by taxi and did not have enough time to send them along  ###  the roads are very potholed and bumpy and , of course , the driving is crazy - but if you 've been anywhere in the caribbean , you already know that and are used to it  ###  : ) ride back was about the same  ###  expect the trip to take between an hour and an hour and a half  ###  arrivalarrival was impressive , actually  ###  the lobby area and is expansive and airy and quite beautiful  ###  as we were in the excellence club , we checked in through them  ###  it was expedient and courteous  ###  we received cool , mint - scented towels and champagne upon arrival , which we enjoyed  ###  we were given a quasi - tour of the excellence club and shown to our room rather quickly  ###  no orientation though  ###  no big deal , we were super tired at that point anyway  ###  us air managed to lose all of our baggage on the way down , which was slightly impressive ( and certainly not the resort 's fault ) , and the excellence was actually quite helpful in helping us track it down  ###  roomthe room was a disappointment  ###  the room had one wall painted hot pink and the pillars and trim were the same color  ###  the jacuzzi in - room was cool  ###  the room was quite small for a suite and not grandeur in the slightest  ###  our jacuzzi drain turned out to be broken and leaked at an impressive rate  ###  it did not stop me from taking a bath , but i had to keep my foot on the drain in order to push it in far enough  ###  the patio door was broken and did not lock , nor did it close properly and caused the a/c to be very spotty  ###  however , when the a/c worked , it worked  ###  our room remained quite cool even through all that  ###  the bathroom was very small and the shower was exceptionally wee  ###  the showerhead was nice , though  ###  our toilet refused to flush unless you held the handle down for the entire flush  ###  the bvlgari toiletries were a welcome surprise but we had troubles getting them restocked during our weeklong stay  ###  face cloths are very hard to come by  ###  someone could make a fortune by starting a shop that only offered face cloths there  ###  : ) minibar is kind of a travesty , they 've got some nuts and crackers but lots of drinks  ###  since we were in the excellence club we had premium alcohol but never ended up drinking in our room  ###  tv was medium sized and satellite was terrible  ###  not that you go there to watch tv , necessarily , but i like to watch a bit before i go to bed  ###  and speaking of the bed  ###  it 's like sleeping on a cement block  ###  wait - a cement block would be more comfortable  ###  both boyfriend and i woke up our first morning there all kinds of sore and in pain  ###  we wound up ordering 10 pillows from housekeeping to put over the mattress and sleep on  ###  it worked out okay - bit lumpy though  ###  : ) housekeeping was highly amused at this  ###  bed curtains were half on , half hanging off  ###  no canopy on the bed which i thought looked strange  ###  floors got very very very slippery if you tracked any water in whatsoever - even be super careful just getting out of the shower  ###  we nearly wiped it quite a few times  ###  also be careful when you take a warm jacuzzi  ###  the humidity causes the floor to dew up a bit and therefore it gets extremely slippery again  ###  speaking of dewy floors , the linens tended to be damp , i expect because of the humidity in the region  ###  still very disconcerting when you climb into a damp bed  ###  : p housekeeping was pretty good and did a decent job  ###  we kept strange hours ( we like to sleep late ) and they worked around it pretty well  ###  i ca not say we ever once got turndown service , though  ###  that was disappointing  ###  i was looking forward to those towel animals  ###  : ) and we tipped generously  ###  we had ultra - finicky wifi that also chose not to work 90% of the time in - room  ###  it was okay - ish when you stepped outside , though  ###  not the absolute worst ever , but not great  ###  we spent new years eve there and i do have to say that the meal they served for that was very good  ###  however , we did not have that experience anywhere else  ###  i do not advocate ordering steak  ###  boyfriend and i ate at toscana twice and both times ended up becoming ill - i was sick enough to throw up all night  ###  boyfriend managed to keep it down somehow  ###  spice was quite good though , as well as barcelona  ###  we ate at the grill for lunch quite often and food is not bad there  ###  be warned that every version of chicken tastes exactly the same , whether you order it jerk , plain , or otherwise  ###  one of their favorite things to say here is that reservations are not necessary  ###  i beg to differ  ###  every time we went to lunch we had an hour+ wait time  ###  once we stood in line at the grill for a half hour before the hostess even deigned to walk over and take down our information so we could go sit down at the bar to wait  ###  dinner was also an hour+  ###  it did not really matter what time you went to eat  ###  they say the 'busy ' times are from 7:30 to 8:30 but if we went previous to this or after it we had a long wait either way  ###  service is so - so but do not expect anything grand  ###  
80	no wedding there  ###  i was so disappointed with my stay at the gran bahia that i would strongly advise any travellers considering it to think again  ###  because me and my husband decided to get married in the dominican i did research for 13 months before the wedding , read the reviews and made sure we were 110% ready and organized when we got there  ###  unfortunately my organization and thoroughness did nothing  ###  when we arrived at the bahia we were blown away by the sheer size of this resort  ###  it is huge  ###  we had a bottle of rum , and a fruit basket along with 2 t - shirts and 2 ball caps waiting for us in the room as a wedding present from the resort  ###  as we started to meet up with the 39 other people that joined us we all took tours of each others rooms  ###  me and my husband had the smallest room out of the whole party  ###  ( not a big deal considering your never in your room ) but you would think that the bride and groom would get a little more  ###  we then noticed that the air - conditioning was not working  ###  after speaking to the front desk they said it was the whole resort  ###  we had friends in another section of the resort who had ac upon arrival  ###  so why would they lie  ###  after 2 days of no air conditioning a girl that came with us with her 15 month old baby called the front desk and told them she had a baby in the room , when is the ac going to be fixed  ###  literally 3 minutes later we all had ac  ###  that was very strange  ###  we received a letter from the wedding coordinator janette telling us to meet her at 10:30 on the sunday  ###  well the wedding was set for the next day at 2pm  ###  we went on sunday to meet janette , and we ended up with a lady named mage  ###  janette was to busy planning other weddings  ###  mage was very nice , great english and just genuinely sweet  ###  the first thing we were told was that our ceremony was going to be moved from 2pm to noon  ###  we said no , we had reserved the 2pm time 13 months ago  ###  mage ran to confirm and we got a 3pm time instead  ###  we picked everything we wanted , 4 bouquets , 4 boutonni?res ( which was a separate charge  ###  ) , a square cake , a projector , a photographer , arranged to have place cards at the table stating where the family would sit etc?  ###  br/>the day of the wedding myself and my 3 bridesmaids were getting our hair done at the spa  ###  i was told by mage that a bus would come pick us up at our room?? t 11:20  ###  the bus never showed  ###  we had to scramble down to the spa to make sure we got there on time  ###  ok so no problems  ###  ramona who did our hair is fabulous  ###  i highly recommend her  ###  when it was time to do the ceremony mage came to the door with a guy named danny to deliver our bouquets  ###  they were short a bouquet  ###  they finished delivering the boutonni?res to the guys , and she said we will get it fixed  ###  by now it is 3pm  ###  35 minutes later mage and danny come back with a ??ake shift?  ###  bouquet that did not match the others  ###  ok i am thinking , no worries  ###  i am getting married today  ###  i then find out that the boutonni?res are too heavy for the guy?? shirts  ###  why did no one mention that to us 'finally on our way to the ceremony , our poor guests sitting in the heat waiting for over an hour for the ceremony to start  ###  the driver took us girls the back way , through sprinklers and driving like a mad man  ###  we all almost fell out of the cart and we all got sprayed by the sprinklers  ###  we had asked many times that ??ow renewal?  ###  not be mentioned a whole bunch through the ceremony  ###  10 times in a 10 minute ceremony ??anny?  ###  yes the bus driver married us , mentioned it  ###  we get through the ceremony and get all the pictures and items finished  ###  that went very smooth  ###  the photographer was just great  ###  reception time was supposed to be 6:30 at the italian a la carte  ###  we go for 6:30 and they are just starting to set it up  ###  at 7:15 they finally had the terrace set up for us  ###  no printed menus , no place settings  ###  the group was not allowed to go into the restaurant until the workers say myself and my husband  ###  as we were walking up we got bombarded by staff asking about our other a la carte reservations  ###  ( was this really the time ) after speaking with them for 10 minutes we finally managed to get in to start enjoying our reception  ###  the waiters were great  ###  about 10 minutes into the reception we were approached by mage  ###  she had told me ??ou are getting a round cake?  ###  i told her that i thought we ordered a square cake  ###  she said you did , but we made a mistake so you get a round cake  ###  my husband at this point was so upset  ###  not only had there been so many problems , but the fact that the staff would not speak to him about anything , only me and he could see i was clearly upset  ###  he pulled her aside  ###  i do not know what he said to them , he still has not told me within 30 minutes we had our square cake  ###  during the whole speeches the staff were loud , talking , yelling at each other from across the room singing , my guests were very upset  ###  near the end of the night mage came up to me and said you don?? get your breakfast in bed in the morning apparently because we did a vow renewal we were not entitled to it  ###  my husband proceeded to remind them that this was part of our package and we will get breakfast in bed  ###  needless to say if the setting for the wedding was not so beautiful i am sure we would have had a worse time  ###  yes these things seem like small problems to a lot of people , but considering how rude janette was ( after we finally got to meet her ) and how un - organized the resort was i feel we are entitled to share our experience  ###  not at one point did we feel like the resort cared about the wedding  ###  they were more concerned about their money  ###  which they still charged us full price for the flowers even though we were missing a bouquet , they charged us extra for 1 bottle of champagne to serve to the guests ( all inclusive ) they charged my whole group for safes that did not work , and no one except me and my husband got our money back  ###  and we were even told that it was complimentary because of the construction right next to our rooms  ###  they charged us extra for a projector , originally $50  ###  00 charge turned into $180  ###  
80	good and bad this is a very long review  ###  i have included the good and bad , but what was bad for us others may not mind  ###  i have included some tips of the things you can do to enjoy your stay more , and avoid the problems we encountered  ###  we stayed at this resort for only a week in december , and originally i was sad to be only going away for one week  ###  however by the end of the week we were glad to be going home  ###  it is a beautiful hotel with a lot of amazing staff  ###  some staff such as housekeeping as has been said in other reviews iffy  ###  we tipped $5 a day , i do not know if this is reasonable or not , but sometimes as in other reviews they would not show up , not that we cared it made no difference to us  ###  we read in the booklet from our room as well as on trip advisor to tip right away and this will ensure good service  ###  we learnt quickly this is not acurate , at least not for us  ###  after having to get denny on the beach 's attention for drinks we tipped him ( around $4 or $5 for 2 drinks ) thinking we would not have to find him and he would come to us in the same spot right in the area he was working , however he never bothered to check with us again  ###  so we learned the obvious , tip after good service not to get it  ###  but as i mentioned before perhaps we do not tip enough  ###  which is sort of weird because apparently tips are included in the all inclusive price  ###  we booked an ocean front colonial juinor suite ( with the jaccuzzi both in the room and on the deck , more about the jaccuzzi 's later ) the deck and view were spectacular and we requested the most private balcony when we booked through west jet not really expecting to get it , but we did and loved it  ###  there was supposed to be a bottle of both rum and whiskey upon arrival in the room also with a fruit basket  ###  the fruit basket was there and so were the glasses but the bottles of rum and whiskey were never seen  ###  for us this was not a huge deal as it is all inclusive and you could not go more then 300 feet without finding a bar , but it is nice to get what you are supposed to without having to fight for it or consently remind and ask for things  ###  we mentioned this to our hola trip representative and she said she would mention it to the hotel , weither she did or not either way we never heard about it again  ###  we also noticed and mentioned to her that our room service privacy door lock was broken , basically meaning anyone could get into our room threw it from the outside , this also was never addressed/fixed  ###  my husband ended up jamming it from the inside with a spoon  ###  however much that really would have stopped someone i do not really know  ###  again possibly not the hotels fault if the rep never did mention it to them we did not feel like fighting with people our whole week there , and i think we are fairly easy going , so just let everything slide  ###  as for the privacy room service door , i am not sure why they have it as the one day that we got room service for breakfast ( which also comes with the room category and which we did not have to remind them ) they never used it anyways they woke us up and came into the room  ###  again not a big deal unless you are expecting them to use the privacy door and you are not ready for someone to come into the room , which we would have been if not for the door anyways , so well just do not expect it maybe , and take pj 's  ###  apparently there is also a sensor in the room that tells staff when you are in the room automatically and they will never disturb you , this did not work for us  ###  they constantly knocked when we were in our room and we did not have the old fashioned yet highly effective do not disturb sign  ###  however we did see these signs elsewhere through out the hotel so if this is something important to you , you may want to ask for one on checkin  ###  you are also supposed to get slippers and house coats for use during your stay  ###  the house coats were there however they were very small , and there were not slippers  ###  so if these things are important to you and you are not a size 0-4 you may want to bring your own  ###  this would not have mattered to us other then the staff knocking and we were scrambling for clothes , oh yes and they only knock twice and come in so do not just grab a robe and head for the door , yell 'just a minute ' or something like that  ###  as for the jaccuzzi 's we never used the one on the deck as it took to long to fill and the smaller one in the room took a long time as well and the water dissappeared quickly once it was full , so we only used it once  ###  in this category of room there is supposed to be beach towels in the room , ours also were missing , no big deal we walked down to the towel hut and tried to get towels and they would not give them to us without a card  ###  not a problem and understandable , we went to the front desk and after explaining that the towels were never in our room did manage to get the cards and then return to the towel hut and trade the card for towels , so if you are in this category of room might be useful to make sure either the yellow beach towels (  ###  room towels are white ) are in your room before the bellman leaves or that you have towel cards  ###  not sure if we just have bad luck or what  ###  the food , well my husband was sick from the day after we arrived until days after arriving home and i was lucky enough to not get sick until about our third day but was also still sick for sometime after returning home  ###  we did not drink any of the water as reccommended and we used bottled water for brushing our teeth , so not sure what that was about  ###  the food is not horrible but it is not great either  ###  definetly take some immodium if you do not need it great , but if you do at least you have it  ###  we were glad we did  ###  we also were pretty glad we took a roll of toilet paper from home to  ###  the paper there is not bad or anything but it is nice to have some really good stuff if you end up having to frequent the bathroom  ###  at least we did not gain weight this year , unlike previous trips elsewhere , which is good  ###  the beach was outstanding , the water is rough but it was windy the whole time we were there but we did not mind we kind of enjoyed the waves and spent pretty much all day every day on the beach  ###  and the water was not so rough , that the childern playing in it had any problems  ###  there is fish you can feed right off the beach in not more then thigh high deep water  ###  and we never wore shoes in the water , there are some rocks to look out for but we did not have a problem  ###  the sand was amazing and we walked for miles barefoot  ###  another great point about the beach you could walk and walk along the ocean  ###  there are a lot of photographers along the beach that will take pictures for you and they do an absoultely amazing job  ###  take advantage of it , the prices are not horrible , and you do not have to buy if you do not want to or end up not liking them  ###  i would recommend taking some kind of inflatable lounger if you like to float in the pool and the beach chairs are not super comfortable  ###  i did get maybe six mosquito bites but my husband did not even get one and we did not use any repalinat , so i do not think they are that bad  ###  of course we are from saskatchewan  ###  as for the children , we were aware that this is a family resort when we went , and we do not particularly like kids , at all  ###  however i thought the resort was large enough we would easily be able to avoid them  ###  especailly since there are childern areas  ###  not so , if you really are looking to get away from kids , or are like us and just are not really kid people , i would highly recommend thinking about adults only resorts , and not this resort  ###  there were crying screaming kids everywhere or we have some really bad luck , and apparently the parents are oblivious to this screaming and acting out i do not know  ###  we went during the school season so this made no difference either  ###  like i said it is a family resort and we were aware of this so  ###  our bad , but important lesson learned  ###  spa ~ we each had half hour massages on the beach and really enjoyed them , so next day we went to book hour long massages at the spa  ###  my husband was in a lot of pain from the beds or pillows so he wanted to try the deep tissue massage i not being that brave and just wanting an enjoyable experience wanted the relaxation massage  ###  they seemed to understand when we booked , but well somehow we both ended up getting the deep tissue and i was left bruised and in pain  ###  however i should have probably attempted to stop her and sort out the problem right away rather then suffer the hour long torture  ###  but was not sure with the language barrier if it would work anyway so just endured  ###  nothing against the spa as far as the bruises and pain go as i am told this is typical with a deep tissue , and i take medication to thin my blood so am more prone to bruising  ###  so you may just want to confirm with your therapist that you are getting what you really want before they begin , to avoid the same mistake i made , and obviously i do not recommend the deep tissue to anyone on anticoagulation therapy  ###  we really liked the waiters and waitresses at all of the resturants and most of the bartenders they were friendly and always happy  ###  if you know spanish you will have an easier time at this resort , however it is not a big deal if you do not , they are pretty good with english  ###  some good drinks to try are the miami vice and of course the majestic  ###  you have to ask to have alcohol in your drink which i thought was a good thing , since it is a family resort with all the kids and preggo 's  ###  the resort is about 1/4 mile long so there is a lot of walking but we enjoy this  ###  we noted a few people in medichairs so it is a very accessible resort if you have a disability  ###  there are elevators at the stairways everywhere we noticed and there were ramps into the lobby to the resturants and on the beach bar area  ###  the trip all in all was not our best , and i am not really sure we would return to this hotel , mostly for the fact of the kids  ###  it was clean and friendly with a beautiful pool and beach and nice rooms  ###  
80	warning to all - read before going  ###  we went to the bahia from may 4-11  ###  i felt it important to share my experience with all of you as i did read posts from this site prior to booking  ###  day 1 friday : arrived at hotel , when you get off the bus , the hotel tags your luggage and they tell you to go ahead to your room  ###  after our luggage was out of site , we realized that the room # on the luggage voucher was different than the room # that came with our keys ( they gave us everything on the bus , no check in was required as we were gold )  ###  we proceeded to the room # that was on the luggage tag , after walking for 20min , with no help , we found the first room  ###  tried the key , nothing  ###  walked another 20min , found the 2nd room , one key ( out of 2) worked , but no luggage in the room  ###  we called the front desk , and then waited for 2 hrs before our luggage came to the room  ###  then we needed to find the front desk so we could get the key for our safe ( you have to pay )  ###  we walked everywhere on the grounds for 3hrs before finding the right reception  ###  we did ask many employees along the way , all pointed us to the wrong direction  ###  we decided to let all of the above slide  ###  day 2 sat : early am , went to our reception to book our al la cartes , they told us 2/4 restaurants we choose were closed for the week  ###  we asked if we could go to the same one 2x , they said no , so we were forced to eat at restaurants that we didn?? like  ###  spent the day at the pool , beautiful day  ###  dinner , went to al la carte , portions small , service acceptableday 3 sun : spent day at the pool , evening , al la carte , dinner menu exactly the same as night before , service a little better ( it was technically a different restaurant ) day 4 mon : went on day trip bavarro runners awesome trip , full  ###  day touring the island  ###  dinner at buffet , substandard , would classify food as a 3 star resortday 5 tues : 11:00 am went for massage and body wraps , give treatments a 8/10, sevice at the spa 9  ###  then we went to the pool , buffet dinner , same rating as above  ###  evening ( this is when the vacation turned into a nightmare ) went to the disco on the resort ( it opens at 12am )  ###  disco was small , and overall not a very happening place we were having a good time until i was walking and slipped on the floor  ###  i landed in a pool of alcohol and glass , someone must have dropped their glass earlier  ###  my right hand was cut and had glass in it and my wrist was in serious pain  ###  i went to the bar to get some napkins to stop the bleeding , the bartender saw my hand , held it over the bar ledge and poured alcohol on it to clean the wounds  ###  i went back to my room , we called the resort medical center ( we had no idea where it was )  ###  by now it was apprx 2:15am , the medical center told us that they can?? do anything right now and to come down in the morning  ###  we asked them to bring a tenser bandage , they refused  ###  i was very upset , and in pain and began to walk to the medical center ( they are suppose to be 24hrs and in room service )  ###  5 min into my walk , i couldn?? take it so i changed my mind and headed back to the room  ###  then , i found myself locked out ( unknowing to me , my friends left the room to come and look for me )  ###  i was knocking on the door , a room service employee saw me , and then called 2 managers to let me in  ###  managers came , saw my hand and drove me to the medical center  ###  two females in the center were obviously upset as i had woke them up , they told me $120 us to see the dr  ###  i told them i have travellers insurance , they told me to go back to the room and get it  ###  at this point , i was tired , frustrated and in pain , asked them again for a tenser bandage and i would pay for it  ###  they charged me $10us for a bandage and i had to ask several times for them to put it on my hand  ###  was driven back to the room for the nightday 6 wed : went to breakfast , then back to room , called my insurance company for assistance ( still in immense pain )  ###  my insurance co  ###  organized everything , called the medical center , faxed them my forms and told them i was on my way there now  ###  got to medical center 10min later , there was a sign on the door saying they stepped out and would be back in 30min  ###  waited 40 min , they didn?? look at my had and told me someone was coming to take me to the hospital  ###  went to the hospital ( in an ambulance , 30 min drive ) , they x - rayed my arm and found my wrist was broken , gave me a cast from my hand to elbow ( insurance covered 100% )  ###  then we realized that they will bring you to the hospital , but no transportation from the hospital  ###  we paid $30 us just to get back to the resort  ###  got back just in time for al la carte , dinner was very good that night , went to bed earlyday 7 thurs : early am , went to reception as directed by my insurance to get an accident or incident report  ###  spent 20 min explaining to an employee what happened , she wrote everything down so i assumed my concern was going to be taken seriously  ###  she called her manager over who basically said sorry , thanks for letting us know i told them that i wanted this documented as it happened on their property , her response was we don?? know this happened here , it could??e happened anywhere and you didn?? pay for your treatment so what would you like us to do  ###  i again explained about all of the employees that i encountered that evening , she told me if i didn?? have their names they couldn?? do anything  ###  so we asked for her manager , they told us she wasn?? available , but they would have her call us , we stormed out very upset  ###  i went for a facial treatment ( which i had booked on monday ) , same girl doing treatment , she was amazing , even brushed my hair and helped me dress ( this was the only employee that ever tried to assist me ) i tried to go to the pool and sit in the shade , but it was far too  ###  hot with a cast , i stayed in the room the entire day  ###  at apprx 5:00, they called the room and told us that we ( me and my two friends ) could stay for 4 days and 3 nights for free  ###  we told them that given our experience so far , we would not stay , plus i was confined to the room  ###  we advised them that we did have spa treatments , total of $300 us and we would appreciate it if they could settle our bill  ###  they told us they would have to check with the general manager of the hotel and would call us back shortly  ###  we left the room at 7pm for our al la carte dinner reservation , no call back  ###  after dinner , we went to the office as we also needed to check out ( you can check out 12hrs in advance ) and needed to know about the bill  ###  they told us they didn?? have an answer yet , we waited 15min , then , apparently they talked to the manger and he told them no , only the free stay  ###  so , i asked for the contact info for their legal department , she told me i had to e - mail their customer service , and refused to provide me with a name or number  ###  then i asked for the name of the general manager , she also refused me that info  ###  i asked her to call the female manager michelle ( not the gm ) down so i could talk to her , they appeared to have called her , then told me she had gone for the day  ###  i stormed out ( again )  ###  twenty min later , we saw michelle walking the grounds , i approached her and told her that i need some form of documentation that this was reported so that when i go home and try to deal with this , the hotel wont deny it  ###  she told me that she would have to talk to the gm about a report and she would meet me in the office the next day at 10am  ###  day 8 friday ( leaving day ) : walked up to the front for the meeting with michelle , we noticed an ambulance in the middle of the grounds and a woman lying on the marble walkway in serious pain  ###  it was very obvious that she slipped , and her leg was broken , she was screaming in pain  ###  we also saw michelle on the scene  ###  we waited aside for michelle , she definitely saw us  ###  after about 5min , the ambulance was gone , michelle took the long way around so she wouldn?? have to walk by us  ###  i tried to catch up to her , called her name 3x before she finally turned around  ###  i told her i knew she was busy , but we are leaving and i need to know about my report , she rudely said ??ts in the office didn?? they tell you  ###  and walked away  ###  i went to the office , expecting some form of prepared document explaining what i had reported , i was handed a form to fill out , it was titled ??omplaint form?  ###  i asked why they didn?? provide me with that the 1st time i had come , they told me that they had to wait for the hospital report  ###  i asked if anyone had actually investigated or spoken with the employees/managers that had contact with me after the accident , they said they didn?? know  ###  my friend filled out the complaint form for me ( same form if we wanted to complain about the food ) and we handed it back to them  ###  end of storyit should also be noted that i did contact the air transat rep who basically had the same attitude as the hotel ??hat do you expect them to do?  ###  i did explain that it wasn?? about money , but if they would have simply asked how they could help me to make the situation better , by employees helping me at the buffet , anything would have been sufficient , but they denied it happened and honestly put me through hell  ###  on another note , i can give one good comment about the resort , the grounds are immaculate  ###

club guests ( there are manysigns upon entering that pool that say its for diamond - club guests only - - - so we respected that and just went to the pool across the small road that the trolly is on ) the diamond club pool looked about as crowded as the  ###  other mid - resort pool anyway ( both less crowded/noisy than the pools by the beach however )  ###  the towel - saving chair game is played here  ###  we 've never been to a resort where this was done so it was new to us  ###  hard to find a chair at the pool or beach ( in front of resort ) in the shade  ###  food -

sports huts you might find a shaded spot open  ###  crowded in the water also  ###  (roped off areas )  ###  dont go in the un - roped off areas because there are many boats going by  ###  water sports - -book things in advance (2 days )  ###  we did the pedalboards and kayaks with no problems but we knew to book in advance  ###  motorized sports are extra $$ ( snorkel trips , banana boats , parasailing etc  ###  )snorkeling from beach - -non - existent  ###  nothing to see plus too many boats going by made it wavy  ###  we walked down the beach pretty far ( to the left as you are looking at the ocean ) , past where the resort - beach ends and i did snorkel a bit from the beach there as there is a patch of coral right offshore  ###  see it - -its a dark spot ) its right past where the lady braids hair on the beach  ###  (past the bavara side of the resort ) i took out a roll/bread and i did see some fish  ###  but other than that , you 'll have to book a snorkel trip  ###  nightly shows -

80	nice resorts , but problems my husband and i stayed at the majestic colonial july 6, 2008 to july 13, 2008  ###  aesthetically , the resort is gorgeous , but it does have some problems  ###  room : we booked the majestic colonial suite room  ###  the room itself was one of the nicest rooms we have stayed in  ###  we were in room 2117, which is on the first floor  ###  there was a bottle of champagne and a plate of fruit in the room for us when we arrived  ###  there is a jacuzzi in the room and on the balcony  ###  you have direct access to the pool with your own cushioned lounge chairs so you do not have worry about finding a spot around the pool  ###  you also have a little lawn in the back leading to the pool , and there are bushes separating the lawns , so you do have some privacy  ###  some of the reviews i have read said the bed was uncomfortable  ###  the bed in our room had a pillow top mattress cover  ###  not sure if that was because we had the upgraded room or not  ###  if you book the upgraded room , you get a breakfast delivered to the room on a morning of your choice  ###  it is not a full fledged breakfast  ###  they bring , coffee , oj , another bottle of champgne , fruit , muffins  ###  we went to the buffet afterwards  ###  room serivce is also free with the upgraded room  ###  only problem is that there really is not much to choose from and the food is not that good  ###  the a/c did work well  ###  pool : the pool its very large and the temperature was always warm , some days a little too warm  ###  it is about 4 feet deep throughout  ###  there is a swim up bar over by the activites portion of the pool  ###  room service : the maid did not come clean the room on her own the first 3 days  ###  we had to call housekeeping more than once each time to have the room cleaned and to get clean towels  ###  as the other reviews have mentioned , there were no washcloths  ###  the mini bar in the rooms are supposed to be re - stocked daily  ###  this also did not happen  ###  again we had to call multiple times  ###  my husband went to the concierge after the third day in a row of problems  ###  after complaining , the room was cleaned and the mini bar was stocked daily  ###  internet : there is an internet room upstairs in the lobby  ###  they charge $5 for 30 minutes  ###  restaurants : for breakfast , the indoor buffet is pretty good  ###  they have a large variety of choices and a couple of cooking stations for made to order eggs  ###  you can also go to the open air restaurant by the beach for breakfast  ###  they have a smaller selection , also buffet  ###  the food for lunch at the indoor buffet is very repetitive  ###  the same foods were offered every day  ###  oh , and if you are wearing a bathing suit that even looks wet , they wo not let you in  ###  you will have to eat at the open air restaurant at the lunch buffet  ###  the pasta station at both places is pretty good  ###  the french restaurant is by far the best restaurant at the resort  ###  we ate there twice during our stay  ###  the french restaurant requires a reservation and guys must wear long pants , and shoes  ###  the steakhouse and the seafood restaurant are the same restaurant even though they list it as two seperate restaurants  ###  they just ask you if you want the steak or seafood menu  ###  it is at the open air restaurant which also serves breakfast and lunch  ###  we did not eat from the seafood menu , but the steakhouse food was pretty good  ###  the mexican/ dominican restaurant was hit and miss  ###  two nights it was good and another night it was pretty gross  ###  they do have a large salad bar/ buffet for appetizers  ###  we did not go to the hibachi ( requires reservation ) part of the asian restaurant , but we did eat at the a la carte part of the restaurant and it was terrible  ###  i got sick from eating the food  ###  for anyone who has food allergies , be very careful of the food at the buffets  ###  many of the foods at the buffet are not labeled so if you have any severe food allergies , do not eat anything unless you know exactly what it is and what is in it  ###  they also use the same tongs to cook seafood and other meats so beware of cross contamination  ###  my husband is very allergic to seafood  ###  we went to the buffet for dinner one night and he ate something that must have touched seafood and got really sick  ###  drinks : we could never get a cold drink anywhere  ###  the frozen drinks were never frozen , just slightly icy even though they are in a machine  ###  the soft drinks were always super warm  ###  i think the problem was that the dispenser did not keep the drinks refridgerated  ###  they stored them at room temperature and just put ice in the drinks which never got cold  ###  beach : the beach was nice  ###  there were plenty of palapas , and we never had issues finding a chair  ###  there is a big drop on the beach as you approach the water and the depth of the water drops a lot a few yards in  ###  the water was very clear and refreshing though  ###  nightlife : the entertainment at the resort is pretty bad  ###  the shows are corny  ###  the michael jackson show is funny for a quick minute but after that minute you are ready to leave  ###  they had a magician one night who was so bad people were just sitting there trying to figure out if he was performing a trick or just walking around  ###  we gave up going to the shows after that  ###  they have a beach party one night with a band , but that too is poorly organized  ###  the casino is small  ###  they have one roulette , black jack , and poker table , though the poker table was never open  ###  the slots were ok , you can actually hit for a couple bucks on them  ###  every night in front of the lobby bar they have a table set up serving nachos , and other snacks  ###  one night they had a smoothie hut set up - this was the only semi - frozen drink i had the entire stay  ###  overall , we had an okay vacation  ###  we travel to the caribbean at least once a year and have been to dominican 3 times now : sun village resort in puerto plata  ###  
80	not so bad travelled to bahia principe march 18 and returned april 1  ###  travelled with my wife and two kids , 13 and 11  ###  roomsour first week we stayed in villa 17 near the two lobbies in a ground floor room  ###  the rooms are nice , we had two double beds and a sleeper sofa  ###  beds were comfortable yet small and we had no issues with room  ###  we were upgraded to golden the second week , villa 22 ( near the beach ) and while the room was very close to beach , all the other extras are a bit of a scam  ###  complexbig is the first impression  ###  the trolley is good but it only takes about 5 minutes to walk from either lobby to the beach  ###  no matter what villa or what upgrade you have , you will be going from one end of the resort to the other  ###  the buffets , restaurants , lobbies , shops , pools are all spread out so get use to it  ###  grounds are immaculate , people always working  ###  the construction for those who backed onto the site looks like it would have been annoying especially considering the service road there is really busy  ###  poolsthree pools available to those unless you are ambar or premier  ###  the main pool is nice but very busy and the chairs go fast  ###  there are two pools in the middle of the resort , one for regular guests and another for diamond/club hacienda  ###  these two pools are smaller and fill quickly  ###  problem i noticed especially at the two smaller pools was that ambar and premier guests were taking up the limited number of seats  ###  this causes a few problems as regular guests are not allowed at the ambar or premier pool  ###  foodbuffets - there are two buffets , one in each lobby  ###  there is alot of selection  ###  yes we did get cold food , food that was over - cooked and the taste was different but food was not problematic  ###  i did notice ambar guests were being turned away from these buffets  ###  a la carteswe ate at (7) of them :1) french - service and food excellent  ###  order the filet mignon , it was incredible  ###  2) mexican - service and food excellent  ###  buffet style appy 's that were usually enough  ###  we ate twice here  ###  garden grill - steakhouse , good service and the food was very good  ###  japanese - excellent food , service ok  ###  the cook we had was a rookie so we did not get a show like other guests  ###  italian - food was ok but service was horrible  ###  appy 's not good if you have kids6) mediteranean - food horrible ( cold ) and service was absolutely brutal7) brazilian bbq - service was ok , alittle pushy but the food was brutal  ###  they totally over - cooked all the meat to the point it was burnt  ###  if you like well , well done , this ones for you  ###  snack bar at the main pool , it was ok for salad , burgers , hotdogs , pasta and we ate lunch there most days only because the buffets are at the other end of the resort  ###  serviceslow is the first thing that comes to mind  ###  we asked for a cot the 2nd or 3rd day and were first told the hotel did not have any  ###  we went to guest services and they called the housekeeping manager directly but one never showed up  ###  be careful what you leave out in your room  ###  we took down some snacks for the kids and some of those were chocolate bars  ###  the bars were inside a drawer and went missing  ###  we thought no big deal and did not mention it  ###  but then we were tired one night and came back early from the show  ###  at about 1030 pm , we heard someone entering our room  ###  my wife confronted an employee entering our room  ###  when she saw my wife , she pretended to talk on a cell phone and left  ###  later that night , at 0300 am , we hear a knock on the door  ###  answer the door and another employee is standing there and claims she is looking for her 17 year old daughter  ###  not sure why she checked our room but something fishy here  ###  we complained in the morning and were quickly escorted to guest services  ###  we told them what happened and they were not happy  ###  there was no reason for the first employee to be entering our room  ###  we were not golden at the time and were not getting turn down or towels replaced  ###  we ended up getting t - shirts , flowers , fruit tray and a letter of apology from the manager  ###  so beware , they can enter your room at anytime and chocolate is like gold there  ###  shoppingpueblo principe at the front of the resort is ok  ###  the cheapy cheapy huts are about 20-30 minute walk down the beach to the right  ###  everything is expensive so take lots  ###  we ran out of sunscreen , very hot there , and it was $15-20 us for a bottle that would normally cost $8  ###  make sure you bargain , there first price is usually so bad it is insulting  ###  divide it by half then do it again and that it the price you should pay  ###  our last night , we bought a wooden gecko and a bamboo wind chime for gifts  ###  the guys first price was $140 us  ###  i could buy it at wal - mart for $30 probably  ###  at the end , i took out $35 us and said that 's it , and after much groaning and whining i walked away with the stuff  ###  beachbest part of the resort  ###  lots of chairs and palapas  ###  beautiful sand and water though it is rough ( wavy )  ###  the beach was closed for one day , they actually had security to keep people out of the water as the waves were large and the current was strong  ###  you will not be disappointed by the beach  ###  activitiesanimation crew tries really hard and are entertaining  ###  we watched the lion king and most of michael jackson , very good shows  ###  there is mini - gold , tennis , basketball , tennis and lots of games at the beach and pool  ###  if you want to do something , there is lots to do  ###  if you have kids , try the mini - golf , its a bit of a joke but the kids loved it  ###  upgradeswe were upgraded to golden club for the second week of our stay  ###  the golden club is closer to beach but the extras imo are not worth the extra cash  ###  room service is a joke  ###  all you get is left - overs from the buffet  ###  i ordered chicken nuggets and fries and they were absolutely cold and had been sitting around for hours  ###  
80	mixed reviews stayed at excellence end of nov  ###  through beginning of dec  ###  in '07 for our honeymoon  ###  overall really enjoyed excellence , however , some little things that could be improved upon  ###  i will break it into categories since this is the best way to keep me from rambling  ###  transfer from airport to hotel : i do not get motion sick at all , so this trip really did not bother me too much , although after a long flight the last thing we really wanted was another 1hr  ###  drive to get to our destination - however , we knew about this prior to coming and it was not too bad  ###  roads are very bumpy though  ###  and this drive really gives you a taste of the poverty in the dominican  ###  arrival : very nice grounds upon arrival  ###  hotel is beautifully maintained  ###  greeted with champagne and a cool towel - very nice touch  ###  staff was very friendly  ###  check - in was a breeze , although the language barrier was a little bit of an issue  ###  we were sent to our room in the 7th  ###  i actually do not remember now for sure  ###  room : loved the room until a couple of the nights we woke up to find little ants in bed with us ( how romantic )  ###  called to get the room sprayed  ###  which they did not take care of all that promptly  ###  i think part of that problem was the language barrier  ###  i finally found one of the guys who brought us room service and showed him what we were talking about , and eventually they came in to spray  ###  never had the ants with us in bed again , just near the balcony  ###  did not ruin our vacation by any means , but was not exactly a pleasant thing to wake up to  ###  rooms were very spacious  ###  loved the daily stocked mini bar included with the cost - the guy who filled ours daily was very nice , and any request we had , he always at least tried to fulfill it  ###  jacuzzi tub was nice  ###  separate shower was nice , minus the weak water pressure ( which actually i appreciated at the end of the week when i was burnt ) my biggest complaint was the bed - and i know i sound really petty when i say that - but i am one of those people that could sleep on the floor and get a great night 's  ###  rest , but this bed was awful  ###  it was probably the most rock - hard bed i have ever slept on  ###  both my husband and myself woke up with sore backs many nights from that bed  ###  again , not a vacation - ruiner , but just something that could be improved upon  ###  on a more positive note , our room view was fabulous - direct view of the ocean , and directly next to the swim - up bar  ###  a/c worked great once we figured out that it shuts off if you have the sliding glass door open  ###  overall a nice room  ###  on a side note , the daily maid service was not consistent  ###  expect to be interrupted at any hour of the day ( up to 5pm in our case ) for them to clean  ###  i actually found the turn - down service at night much more consistent  ###  they did a great job  ###  beach : personally , this was the most disappointing aspect of the trip for me  ###  i am a beach - a - holic  ###  i have been to many beautiful beaches all over the caribbean  ###  for me , this beach was not impressive at all  ###  the waves were very rough , to the point where we went in maybe twice ( and i used to be a lifeguard )  ###  however , i know this was a complaint of many people , and you either have to deal with it , or take a tour somewhere on the caribbean side to get your calm beach fix ( which is what we did )  ###  the other thing i noticed was that it was extremely windy there  ###  maybe it was just the time of year/the week we were down there , but it was noticeably windy  ###  again , nothing reflecting on the resort itself , just my opinion of the beach itself  ###  plenty of chairs around the beach , however  ###  great attentiveness when it came to staff bringing drinks to people out on the beach  ###  next time we take a trip , however , we will be venturing to the caribbean side  ###  service : overall , phenomenal staff  ###  you really ca not ask for more energetic , friendly , kind , attentive staff than that of the staff at excellence  ###  i will say , however , that if you dont want to participate in an activity , such as beach volleyball , karaoke , etc  ###  do not be in that general area when it is going on  ###  many times the staff tried to get me to join these activities , when all i really wanted to do was relax or just watch my husband participate , and they seemed rather pushy , not taking a simple no thank you as an answer  ###  maybe that was just my experience , but i really did not appreciate it  ###  and yes , i do realize it is their job to get everyone involved , but i also believe they should respect the wishes of those who really dont want to participate  ###  food : overall , i would rate the food a 7/10  ###  primarily did room service for breakfast - which was decent  ###  lunch options were limited , as you have to be appropriately dressed to get a meal at the grill and toscana  ###  when you are in your bathing suit all day and just want a quick burger , you really dont feel like going inside to change into nicer clothes  ###  just me , but i wish the dress code was not quite so rigid for lunch  ###  there was the option of going to the lobster house ( which was about a 45 min  ###  wait for a burger and nachos ) , or the beach bbq , which we tried once and loved it  ###  the grill was excellent , in our opinions , for both lunch and dinner  ###  had our honeymoon dinner at spice , which was good  ###  chez isabelle was great , but i had no clue what half of the food was  ###  just ask the waiter for their recommendation and go with it  ###  unfortunately , the chocolate martini i had was a bit strong , so dinner at tuscana was cut short  ###  never tried the lobster house for dinner  ###  i dont remember what i even had at barcelona , so it was probably good  ###  i wish the resort had a beach side bar that served more snacks/quick meals  ###  also be prepared for slower service , which i expected prior to coming , but when staff are just standing around talking to one another rather than asking you what you want to drink or taking your order  ###  it just seems as though they could improve upon that  ###  pool and bar : wonderful pool  ###  sometimes we had difficulty finding pool floats , but it was not too long before a couple gave theirs up  ###  but overall , awesome , awesome pool  ###  lots of activities for those that want to get involved  ###  we never tried the pool with the waterfall in it , but walked by it and it looked very quiet and relaxing  ###  beach/pool bars were both excellent  ###  
80	returned from the gran bahia principe  ###  good overall , but we got sick i just returned from our vacation to the gran bahia principe punta cana  ###  i traveled with my husband , three children and parents  ###  my experience with this resort : we had a great flight , caught a coach bus at the punta cana airport and had a half hour ride to the resort  ###  the resort representative gave us an information packet with our room keys , wristbands and towel cards  ###  upon arrival , we were met with a red punch drink and dominican dancers in costume  ###  we tagged our luggage and left it with the bellboys  ###  our room was not yet ready , so we used the pool until about 3:00 p  ###  the gran bahia is two resorts in one  ###  they are mirror images of each other  ###  the bavaro to the left and the punta cana to the right  ###  ( we booked on the bavaro side , but were actually placed in a room on the punta cana side  ###  this really did not matter to us because they are identical )  ###  if you are staying on the punta cana side , you must use the lobby bar , buffet restaurant and guest services on that side  ###  likewise with the bavaro side  ###  the rest of the bars , a la carte restaurants and facilities are for all guests to share  ###  the premier area of the resort is for guests who want to spend a little more money to have their own little resort within the larger resort  ###  we found the hotel reception staff to be a little stand - offish  ###  they seemed irritated when we asked them questions or tried to exchange money  ###  the rest of the staff : bartenders , waiters , housekeepers were very friendly and tried very hard to help even when they knew very little english  ###  our rooms were in buildings 5 and 7  ###  for us this was a perfect location because we were close to the beach  ###  for those who are further from the beach , there is a trolley that runs continuously  ###  we would catch the trolley to get back to the lobby and buffet restaurant  ###  another reason we liked being within walking distance is that the pool restrooms were not kept very clean  ###  we opted to use the restrooms in our hotel rooms  ###  the rooms were large , clean and comfortable  ###  the bed linens and towels are not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel in the us , but were adequate  ###  housekeeping was great  ###  we left a tip each day and asked for extra water  ###  the beach here is absolutely breathtaking  ###  get out there early in the morning to get a good spot in the shade  ###  the hotel rules state that you 're not supposed to save lounge chairs , but this is not enforced  ###  it seemed that people were getting up earlier each morning  ###  my dad would usually go out around 6:30 a  ###  to save some chairs  ###  there is a company called scuba caribe who rents out the sailboats , windsurfers , kayaks and also the excursions and motorized sports that cost extra  ###  they are located in a little building on the beach  ###  i would suggest getting there first thing in the morning ( i think they open around 9:00) to reserve the activity you would like to do because they fill up fast  ###  their english is not great and there 's no rhyme or reason to the way they wait on people either  ###  you can be the next person in line and they will pass you over to help someone else  ###  this was a source of frustration for us  ###  we went on a two hour snorkel excursion to a nearby reef  ###  it was fun , but the guide drove us to the reef and basically said jump in  ###  there was no snorkeling/safety instruction that we 're used to getting on these types of excursions  ###  we went to the japanese , french and mediterranean restaurants  ###  the medditeranean was our favorite  ###  i know that a lot of guests favor the japanese , but it was not up to the standard of any japanese steakhouse i 've been to in the us  ###  the lobby buffet restaurant had the best variety  ###  you could eat breakfast and lunch at the seafood restaurant by the beach or lunch any of the beach snack bars , but the lobby restaurant had the biggest selection  ###  ( they will serve hotdogs , hamburgers and chicken at the beach snack bars )  ###  the fruits are delicious , pineapple , mango , guava , passion fruit and watermelon at every meal  ###  they also serve some kind of seafood concoction with mussels , squid , etc  ###  and a pasta bar at dinner  ###  one thing they do well is dessert  ###  the desserts were excellent  ###  the meats were usually overcooked  ###  you will be served the same cut of pork , chicken , steak and fish in every restaurant , they 'll just put a little different spin on it  ###  not the quality we 're used to getting in a good restaurant here  ###  go to the lobby bar to get the best drinks  ###  we drank a lot of umbrella drinks , but they were not very strong because i never got a buzz and i 'm not a heavy drinker  ###  do not bother to wait in line at the swim up bar  ###  there 's a bar across the pool to the left that 's never busy  ###  there were two shows every night  ###  an earlier 9:45 show ( located in the lobby theatre ) and a later 11:30 show ( located in the pueblo pricipe theatre )  ###  shows will be posted on a board outside of the theatre  ###  the michael jackson show was entertaining  ###  what is the pueblo principe  ###  the pueblo principe is a large courtyard located in the front of the resort  ###  here you will find the casino , disco , pool tables , shopping , a hamburger restaurant , bar and a stage  ###  beware of the vendors  ###  they will solicit you to purchase items from their carts  ###  if you 're brave enough , you can bargain with them  ###  things i wish i knew before i came : with a family of five , we went through a lot of sunscreen  ###  i had to buy two more tubes at the cost of $17  ###  i also forgot my sunburn lotion and had to buy that too  ###  if you have children , bring one of those lycra swim shirts  ###  many of the children were wearing them and i wish i had them for my kids  ###  they got burned the first day even though they were wearing lots of sunscreen  ###  bring more cash , less traveler 's checks  ###  
80	excellence is excelente  ###  ( this is a long one  ###  just returned from a one week stay at excellence punta cana with my husband and two friends  ###  overall we had an awesome time  ###  this was probably the best vacation we??e taken  ###  we met some really great people along the way too ( shout out to brenda  norm , harvey  jimena , lyn  matt , chaz  i ca not remember her name  ###  so sorry , tad  kim , jordan  kate )  ###  the weather was great every day , though apparently there was rain the week prior  ###  it rained a few nights pretty heavily but we were never really impacted by it  ###  i??e broken down my reviews by category/topic and then did overall pros and cons  ###  hope others find this helpful  ###  transportation/airport : ( b ) most guests have some type of airport transportation included in their package  ###  we could have too , but the thought of an hour long ride on a bus with stops along the way was not appealing to us  ###  we instead chose to do a taxi  ###  we were charged $60us for 4 people each way which isn?? bad ( $30pp round trip plus tip )  ###  upon arrival at the airport you will laugh when you??e forced to have your picture taken before you can get your tourist card  ###  it?? a little random  ###  you get on one line to get the $10pp card , then you leave that line to another line right next to it and someone there collects the card immediately ( you literally hold onto the card for 30 seconds ) , then you go through immigration and on to baggage claim  ###  it was a bit hectic but not too bad  ###  we took vip taxi from the airport and on our date of departure we had the front desk call us a car  ###  no problems with either car  ###  the ride is long and bumpy  ###  the roads are barely paved  ###  if you have a woozy stomach it might be tough  ###  i get car sick , though , and i was fine  ###  the scariest part was probably going to the resort we passed by two guys wearing dark clothing and carrying machine guns?  ###  interesting to say the least  ###  but , didn?? scare us  ###  resort overall : ( a - ) wonderful  ###  it?? an older resort so you can some of the areas for improvement when you concentrate , but it?? a beautiful place  ###  they have so many people working so hard to maintain things  ###  the grounds are impeccable  ###  the wildlife is great  ###  we saw a peacock , parrots , flamingos , geese , and turtles during our stay  ###  when you arrive , you??e greeted with a cool , citrus - infused towel and a glass of champagne while your luggage is whisked away  ###  what a way to be greeted  ###  the lobby is magnificent and very much the center of life aside from the pool and beach during the day  ###  we only stayed in the large , main pool at the lobby end but we had a great time there  ###  we didn?? try the casino at all  ###  all the bars were pretty much the same  ###  went to the swim up bar once or twice  ###  there was no need to go to the bar  ###  there were waitresses all over the place always asking what you needed  ###  ordering while hanging in the pool?  ###  does it get any better than that  ###  our absolute favorite two people at the pool were juliana and francisco  ###  the biggest issue i have with the pool and resort management overall concerns the blue floats  ###  i know this is an issue at many all inclusives , but it really should be addressed  ###  there is absolutely no reason why guests should be allowed to hold onto floats for hours on end when they are not using the pool ( perhaps reading , eating , sleeping ) and may not even be at the pool for hours on end  ###  there were more times than i can count on one hand where there were floats literally sitting next to or on top of chairs for 3 or 4 hours  ###  resort managers should request all floats stay in the pool so that anyone who would like one can use one  ###  it was ridiculous  ###  or , why not have two floats per room with the room number on them so that everyone has one  ###  we used the internet caf? once and it was pretty cheap so don?? worry about bringing your laptop , unless you??e downloading photos  ###  we did not stay in the excellence club , but didn?? really see a need to  ###  we had everything we could want and saved an extra $100 per day  ###  room : ( a - ) loved our room  ###  we were on the ground level but it never presented any problems  ###  we stayed in building 1 which was great because we were so central to everything  ###  some people who stay in building 7 and up are on the other side of the resort , but nothing is too far away  ###  you just end up hanging out at a different side of the pool  ###  i took two bubble baths while i was there and they were great  ###  never had a problem with anything in the room  ###  would have been nice to have some snacks in the mini - bar and our rum was never replaced despite leaving a few tips  ###  nor did we ever get towel art  ###  but honestly , i don?? care because all i need a cleaning lady to do is clean and that was done very well  ###  the bed was a bit hard for my husband , but fine for me  ###  the best part of the room , if you asked the men at the resort , is channel 21  ###  restaurants/food : ( b+ ) we never had a really long wait anywhere which was nice  ###  this is not a ??ake your reservations the day you arrive?

80	find a different resort , you can thank me later  ###  if you are thinking about going to punta cana , dominican republic - to the occidental resort , my advice is to find yourself a different destination  ###  i have been to many developed and undeveloped countries and by far this was my worst experience of any resort  ###  if you are the type that needs specifics read on , those we would take the word of a seasoned traveler , start looking for another resort  ###  the photos looked inviting on the internet as we booked our summer vacation  ###  we , wife and i and two kids - 12 year son and 9 year daughter were excited to spend a week in sunny paradise  ###  as we were driven up to the entrance , we did a double take  ###  the lobby was run down and unkempt  ###  there was no welcoming effort at the resort  ###  few dirty glasses were piled up on a dirtier tray by the side of the entrance  ###  behind it lay old cooler presumably holding water  ###  the lobby was filled with people  ###  it was almost four o??lock in the after noon  ###  we waited about 35 minutes to get to the front counter  ###  the person at the front , appeared over whelmed , there was only one additional help  ###  he was unable to locate our reservation at first , after about five minutes of searching around on table filled with prepared envelopes he finally did  ###  then he told us that there would be 30-60 minutes wait before our room would be available  ###  ??t is being cleaned?  ###  was the response as signed posted all around declared that check out time was 12:00 am  ###  there was no smile , no apologies , no nothing  ###  , as we waited starved and tired from our travel to be assigned a room  ###  we asked for help and all we got were pitches on how to return at the occidental for cheaper price - a vacation club sales orientation , finally we were directed to a snack bar to have some lunch , so much for our visions of tropical drinks and exemplary service  ###  we received our room assignment as promised upon return  ###  we received keys for the room and check out cards for the beach towels  ###  the towels were only to be provided upon presenting the card and we were asked to return our four cards or face $20 per missing card fee upon check out  ###  after that brief discussion we were driven to our room in a golf cart  ###  the property itself appeared aged  ###  the property layout was that of apartment condos , 8-10 units in each building  ###  there was ample vegetation with mature growth around the property  ###  the room itself was large , however , it had a single bed and a pull out sofa  ###  we had requested two queen size beds - but were glad to take whatever we got  ###  that definitely set the expectations for the remainder of the trip  ###  over the next seven days in that room , we experienced three episodes of no water on three different days , each lasting more then two hours  ###  this means no shower , and most importantly no flushing , gross  ###  the plumbing code needed some upgrading on the entire property as in our room and outside , various areas , there was that indefensible odor of human waste , something that no on should have to experience ever , not just on a vacation trip  ###  there were numerous episodes of no hot water when necessary  ###  the maid service was good but after the first night we realized that maids would not change the linens except upon guests check out days  ###  imagine , young children making a mess in bed with salty water etc and have to sleep in that for the next few days  ###  though on the internet i saw that the property was rated 4 stars , i would give it one  ###  we rested for a while , and decided to get a relaxed meal at one of the many restaurants the place boasts  ###  we went to the italian place  ###  upon arriving there we were asked if we had made reservations  ###  i shook my head ??o?  ###  we were advised that we would need reservation to dine here , and the reservation can only be made before 3:00pm and can be made in the morning for that days dinner plans  ###  i protested that we had arrived earlier in the day after three  ###  may be it was the frustration in my voice , or the big smile on my wife?? face or the hunger in my kids?  ###  eyes or may be he was just a nice guy - he let us dine there  ###  the food was two steps below olive garden  ###  the service was poor  ###  to sum up our dinning experience at the occidental - next day i called at 2:00 pm to reserve and the operator told me i had to make a reservation before noon  ###  we attempted to go to the oriental place and we were turned away  ###  the restaurant was visibly half empty  ###  the following day , i called at 10:30am and was told that reservation had to be made in person at the desk before noon  ###  my wife stopped by there to make reservation for the mexican place  ###  she was told that it was booked for the next five days  ###  she walked away  ###  later that morning , i went up to the desk and asked for the same reservation was given the same answer  ###  i am not the one to walk away and asked why the place was booked for the next five days when reservations are only accepted for the same day  ###  she told me that they now accept reservation for the next three days and gave me slips for the italian , oriental and the brazilian places for the next three evenings  ###  but nothing for that day or nothing for the mexican place that i had asked for  ###  she suggested that i show up at the restaurant and speak to the manager and take our chances  ###  i was not going to fall for it , and asked to speak to the manager  ###  after all the huffing and puffing for the next 25 minutes i got what i wanted  ###  reservation for the mexican place for the evening  ###  in the end , the food was not worth the effort i went through to arrange the plans  ###  the place was nearly empty  ###  all of the so called restaurants were of poor quality and i would not give them repeat business in my town  ###  the pizza place and the taco place were average but service was unreliable as was the food  ###  the buffet was decent for being used as the main place to eat  ###  there was again smell of the rotting food in the rear part of the dinning area  ###  i first hand witnessed poor hygiene and food handling at the buffet from the servers from behind the counter  ###  the other two places were - a small snack bar and limited buffet near the beach , again nothing spectacular here to speak of  ###  the all inclusive for alcohol was only for domestic selection and was limited  ###  let?? talk about the beach experience  ###  the beach was spectacular , water was blue green and warm , again employees were not friendly  ###  the shaded lounge chairs were always taken , as early as 7:30 am  ###  it was not until my last day , when i was out on the beach at 6:00am hoping to catch the sunrise that i saw hotel personal placing towel and magazines on the choicest of locations  ###  my guess is , they were either paid the day before or were hoping to collect tips over the remainder of the day from the hotel guests  ###  one after noon , i heard music being pumped loud through the speakers near the beach - song being played was ??

80	great facility and beach - however  ###  the gand bahia principe was generally a very nice resort with great facilities and beach  ###  however there were several incidents that made our visit less than enjoyable and thus my lower rating for overall experience  ###  first the cons  ###  our flight was cancelled and we arrived a day late  ###  even though  the hotel was notified thru gogo travel there seemed to be a snafu with our check in at the club golden reception area  ###  it  took about 20 mins even though we were the only people  checking in at approx 3:30 pm  ###  much computer checking for our room it appeared  ###  finally assigned villa 64-110  ###  it was 2 dbl  beds , not the king requested and we were told we would get  ###  unpacked and headed to beach/pool  ###  came back and went to  take shower and discovered water leaking from above our  shower from what i assumed wwas the shower above  ###  contacted club golden to inform and they said thet would send someone  ###  went to dinner/drinks and returned to room late  ###  shower was not leaking ( anyone using unit above  ###  ) but wiped up what i thought was residual water on the floor  ###  next morning awoke and found puddle 2x4 ft on floor from  leaking shower  ###  also discovered no robes/slippers/room  service menu per club golden upgrade  ###  conatcted club golden again and informed that i wished to be moved to another room , this time with the king bed and amenities included in club golden  ###  moved to villa 23-104 around 4 pm when it was  available  ###  club golden said that they would comp the cost of the in room safe for our inconvience , just stop by the club golden reception office to collect the refund  ###  we set the safe and tested it once and all ok  ###  when we got ready to go to dinner and lock it , it would not work  ###  called club golden to report and  told a technician would be there in 5-10 mins  ###  30 mins later we carried our stuff with us and went to dinner because no one  came  ###  stopped by club golden after dinner that same night to collect our refund , but was told that we would have to come back the next day after 10 am for this  ###  also checked on the status of safe repair and was told that we needed to be in the room when the tech was there  ###  call them when we get there and they will send a tech , 5-10 min arrival after call  ###  we made the 1st call at 8 pm from the room  ###  at 8:30 we made the 2nd call to inform no show  ###  at 9 pm called main reception and spoke to a manager ( ) who took info and said they would call right back  ###  at 9:30 called guest services to inform of all the above  and my desire to register a formal complaint with management  ###  i did not pay to stay in my room all night at this resort while  being told 5-10 mins , i had been more than patient up to this point  ###  at 9:45 the tech finally arrives and replaces the 4 aa  batteries that caused the whole problem , a 5 min fix  ###  on our 3rd day there we were called at 8:20 am telling us we needed to stop by and sign new papers for the safe , even though we had done this with our initial room  ###  good thing we were awake  ###  finally went to club golden office late that  afternoon and they did not know what we were talking about  ###  told to return the next morning again to resolve  ###  i 'm spending more time with club golden than anywhere 's else in the resort  ###  finally on the 4th morning we meet with juan in club golden office to resolve all this  ###  juan must be some kind of manager because he wears a golden yellow shirt to set him off the other employees  ###  he now tells me that i must present my passport so they can make a copy in order to refund my measley $20 dollars  ###  at this point i inform him and all in the office that i will not do this and this is the last  apearence i will make in this office  ###  i have spent way too much time in dealing with the club golden reps with little success  ###  little do i realize that i have to go to club golden to check out on my last day  ###  when i do there is a discrepency in my bar bill  ###  we had 1 scotch and 1 grand marnier that where not all inclusive  ###  the first check presented to me that night was for $2500 dominican which was an error and i did not sign  ###  the  correct amount was $510 dominican which i signed for  ###  of course at check out they wanted $3010 dominican  ###  one more time i was asked to come back in a little while after they went to check the issue out at the lobby bar  ###  we go to breakfast and return to find all is finally well and we are issued our all important check out voucher  ###  without this security will  permit you to collect your luggage and board the transferr transportation to the airport  ###  you must get up early ( before 8 am ) to place towels on chairs if you desire any shade during the day  ###  resort info says that this is prohibited , but not enforced  ###  we observed many reserved chairs not occupied from 8 - 12:30 pm and then the reservers would leave by 2 pm  ###  no consideration for others  ###  and these were not all americans as a lot of people are fond of blaming  ###  hard to make reservations for restuarants  ###  with many groups staying for 2 weeks at a time it was hard for us on our 5 day trip to get in anywhere unless you wanted to dine at 9-9:30 pm  ###  then there were still limited options  ###  we wound up only getting one while there  ###  now the pros - beautiful resort and generally well maintained  ###  great beach and water  ###  a little murky and choppy but still great  ###  very hardworking employees , make sure to take $100 worth of $1 bills and tip  ###  not needed but they deserve it  ###  buffets were good  ###  tried several things that i 've never had  before  ###  never got sick  ###  ate at the mediteranean one evening  ###  good food and service  ###  a nice change from buffet  ###  outstanding bartenders in punta cana lobby bar at night  ###  to alexis and juan  ###  please tip them well  ###  drink mamajuana , it will cure what ails you  ###  called liquid viagra by some  ###  we brought the makings home  ###  buy it at the airport after you clear inspection and carry on ( bottle with dry ingredients only )  ###  
80	overall , a nice resort my wife and i just returned from our stay at the majestic  ###  we were there from feb  ###  7th - 11th  ###  since i booked this trip six months ago i had a lot of time to read the reviews on trip advisor  ###  like others before me mentioned , the reviews at either end of the spectrum ( i  ###  , worst resort ever or the best resort in the world ) should be taken with a grain of salt  ###  clearly the majestic is a nice place and probably one of the best in punta cana  ###  but it also has its flaws and is definitely not the 5 star resort it 's oftentime advertised as  ###  arrival - our flight arrived in the late afternoon on a thursday  ###  many reviews have stressed the importance of not taking pre - arranged shuttles from the airport  ###  i booked mine way in advance and really did not feel like making changes so we took the shuttle  ###  we had no problems  ###  no waiting in long lines at the airport or anything like that  ###  the van was very comfortable  ###  there were only 6 of us with 4 going to the majestic and 2 going to the riu palace ( two resorts down the beach ) so it was not as if we were making a ton of stops  ###  i 'm pretty sure the transfer would have been worse had we arrived on a friday or saturday  ###  i 'd keep that in mind when booking  ###  check - in - again , this seemed to be a major complaint by many of the negative reviewers  ###  we were fortunate to arrive in the late afternoon so the lobby was nearly deserted of new arrivals  ###  we were greeted by the famous victor who was as advertised - very accommodating and professional  ###  he not only checked us in but escorted us to the dinner reservations desk and walked us through making reservations for the week  ###  he then accompanied us all the way to our room which was at the other end of the resort nearest the beach - probably a 10 minute walk  ###  he explained the room 's amenities and what was included in our package and explained the layout of the resort  ###  it was all very professional and much appreciated  ###  i 'm not sure why we received the royal treatment by the manger ( or one of the managers ) of the resort  ###  all of the arriving guests i saw had to find their rooms on their own  ###  i think the service we received was due to a ) the lack of guests checking in at the time we arrived and b ) the fact that i called the resort 4 times in the previous month to confirm my reservation and also emailed them the week prior ( as others have recommended )  ###  check - in could not have gone better  ###  room - we had an ocean view suite in building 2 - room 2154  ###  the room was very nice and well situated  ###  no foul odor or exposed wires as reported by other reviewers  ###  i would recommend for those staying in an ocean front suite to request a room on the second or third floor for optimum ocean views  ###  we were on the ground floor and could see the ocean ok , but the second floor would have been nicer  ###  one tip : confirm on arrival what plan you have  ###  i was not aware that i had purchased the 'supreme package ' which gave us free room service ( not included in the standard all - inclusive ) and premium alcohol  ###  no complaints about the room  ###  grounds - the resort 's grounds are immaculate  ###  there is no doubt that the grounds crew does a wonderful job maintaining a beautiful landscape  ###  pool - even the most negative reviews gushed about the pool and rightly so  ###  the pool is the best i 've been in  ###  it meanders through the center of resort , around various bars , the spa , and restuarants  ###  i felt that best thing about the pool was that the areas in which to lounge in were spread out in pockets  ###  it 's was not as if you looked up the pool and saw chairs lining it all the way to the beach  ###  this design eliminated the feeling of being in a crowded resort pool  ###  and , aside from the wet bar area , the pool areas were fairly quiet  ###  beach - the beach was nice  ###  it 's a half moon shaped beach ( jutting into the ocean ) and always felt uncrowded  ###  my wife and i took a long walk down the beach and felt that the majestic 's was the nicest out of the any of the resorts around it  ###  we never had any problem finding beach chairs  ###  i much prefer a beach on the caribbean sea , however  ###  the atlantic coastline was fairly rough even though our beach was guarded by a reef 200 yards away from the shoreline  ###  the water was warm and clear  ###  entertainment - the entertainment was surprisingly good  ###  i 'm using the first one to want to leave a resort show , but the shows involving the local dance troupe ( the stars are here and the michael jackson show ) were really good  ###  food/drink - ok , here 's where i start siding with the negative reviews  ###  my wife and i put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the quality of food in whatever resort or hotel in which we 're staying  ###  i can honestly say that this is my first vacation ever that i did not enjoy one good meal  ###  most of the food was really bland and fairly tasteless  ###  even the reservation - only restaurants - le gourmet and taino ( japanese ) - produced really bland food  ###  i never expected the low quality of the food , even after reading all the bad reviews  ###  i was really shocked and disappointed  ###  the supreme buffet was , unfortunately , the best option for food there  ###  the drinks were ok  ###  it seemed they got worse the farther away from the lobby you went  ###  the bars in and around the lobby produced really good drinks  ###  oh , and expect the worst wine you 've ever had  ###  seriously - it was like drinking blueberry schnapps  ###  the wet bar and beach bar were just ok  ###  if you 're the type of person that just wants to go and enjoy the fun and sun and food is secondary , do not worry about the food  ###  it 's not really terrible or anything  ###  it 's just not as good as we would have wanted  ###  people - the cool thing about this resort is that it is very diverse  ###  in fact , i would say that americans were in the minority - there were a ton of europeans ( especially spanish ) and canadians  ###  it was nice to meet people from all over the world and not feel like the resort was dominated by americans  ###  but , as luck would have it , i was again embarrassed by a few of my countrymen ( i stress a few - most were great )  ###  why is it that drunk and obnoxious americans need to always make a scene  ###  most everyone there was nice and quiet and kept to themselves except for those two or three groups of americans who had to direct attention to themselves while drinking their 40- oz insulated mugs full of presidente ( which i found ironic considering how quickly they were consumed )  ###  i 'm not trying to tell anyone to not have fun - my wife and i are under 30 and drank all week - but seriously , what is the need for the constant attention - seeking commotion  ###  what 's wrong with having a good time without reinforcing the stereotype of the tommy boy - esque american  ###  aside from some slight annoyances , we had a good time  ###  
80	a very nice vacation experience my wife and i just returned from excellence punta cana after a 6 night stay in mid - may 2008  ###  our goal was to relax , hang by the pool , a little romance , a couple of novels , and a week away from most of the normal stuff ( like children and work )  ###  our expectations were met on every front and exceeded on most  ###  the very short version is that the weather was fabulous , the room accommodations were fine , the food ranged from very good to really outstanding , the staff was very hard working and helpful , and we would suggest that you seriously consider excellence for an upscale , yet affordable vacation experience  ###  now the details and the very long version  ###  my wife and i ( early 50s , both educators ) had been talking about a resort vacation for more than a year  ###  we have cruised the caribbean a couple of times and enjoyed those experiences , have gone to atlantis a couple of times ( splurge , anniversary  ###  i have read reviews that made excellence look like a great possibility , and a good deal as well  ###  my wife joined spirit air 's 9$ club , as spirit hubs out of ft  ###  lauderdale , thus is quite convenient  ###  we booked the air for what we considered a bargain basement price  ###  then i went to work on the land portion  ###  i priced the resort portion at 15 different places  ###  i ended up booking with an online travel service called skoosh  ###  their price was more than $400 below the average price from other providers  ###  i was concerned as i had no skoosh experience , but everything went just the way that it should have  ###  i was very happy with the price , and happy with everything else  ###  our flight from ft  ###  lauderdale to punta cana was non - stop and non - eventful  ###  we processed thru customs and just as the resort said , there was a driver holding a sign with our name on it  ###  we arranged transport via taxi through excellence via email and it worked out great  ###  the price was $60 and worth it  ###  the trip was not the harrowing , take a valium , oh my god trip that others have reported  ###  parts of the road are not good , there are some potholes the size of vws , and some speedbumps that are really short walls , but our trip was just a few minutes over 1 hour on the way to the resort and a few minutes short of an hour on the way back to the airport  ###  taking the taxi eliminated all of the stopping at other resorts and all of those issues , and i would recommend considering this option  ###  our arrival and initial processing at excellence was quick and easy  ###  we had asked for a king room , but found a double  ###  they offered to move us the next day , as no other king was available  ###  we ended up looking at the king room the next day but stayed because of location  ###  we found that almost all of the time we spent in the room was either in the jacuzzi bathtub ( bring your own bubble bath  ###  very good tip ) or sleeping , so the room was not really an issue  ###  it was spacious , kept clean and well stocked , but we did not spend much time there  ###  we were in building 9 and found it to be very convenient with respect to the pool , and the restaurants  ###  in addition , and very important to us since we are both teaching on - line classes was internet access  ###  we had consistent connections in the room ( not so much by the pool ) with good speed  ###  we could keep up with our classes and e - mail and deep up with the home front very easily  ###  we spoke to others that did not have the same internet success , so if internet is important to you , you might look toward building 9 or that vicinity  ###  most of our time was spent by the pool , and what a pool it is  ###  every morning , the entire pool deck was mopped , and the whole pool was brushed  ###  take a look at some of the pictures in other reviews , and you will realize just what that entails  ###  the pool deck is of terra cotta like tiles , and sandals or flip - flops are an absolute necessity as those tiles start getting hot by late morning and by mid afternoon make it a challenge to walk 15 feet without risking blisters  ###  there are some people that hoard space , grabbing 2 different sets of lounges ( sun and shade ) as well as a poolside bed  ###  these are also the people that apparently cannot dry off without 6 towels , and have to have a pool float by them regardless of whether they will use them or not  ###  it is true that to get ??rime?  ###  spots , it is necessary to get down early  ###  one group of 20 had a 6 am wake up call so one of the group could go down and get space together  ###  i was usually down by 7am ( i normally wake early ) and had no problem getting our same ??rime?  ###  spot each day  ###  hint : take your towel back to your room if you plan on claiming space early  ###  the beach towels didn?? always show up early , but they always did show up  ###  the rule seems to be that a folded or rolled towel indicates availability and a spread out towel means reserved  ###  bars are spread out along the length of the pools , and pool and beach waiters are plentiful  ###  most of the pool activities occur toward the north end of the pool  ###  a list of the day?? activities is available each morning at the concierge desk  ###  my wife enjoyed the aqua gym ( water aerobics ) , and water volley ball appeared quite popular as well  ###  lots of other pool - based games occurred throughout the day , but we were usually engaged with novels and did not partake  ###  there is an introduction to scuba in the pool that looked like fun , and if you have never experienced scuba , it might be a memorable experience  ###  most of our pool time was hanging out , floating , at the pool bar , or just finding a quiet , shady spot to read  ###  there were some topless women sunning on the pool deck , but hey , we??e all adults , right  ###  there was a bit more toplessness on the beach itself , and at least one couple went several hundred yards south on the beach and established that area as the nude beach  ###  all in all , i would say the percentage of topless was in the single digits  ###  most swim wear was quite sedate , as was most behavior  ###  another activity that we engaged in was the horseback riding  ###  we arranged our horse excursion the day we arrived and went out 2 days later at the 10 am flight  ###  it was at no cost , and was really outstanding  ###  it is supposed to be a half hour ride on the beach , but we were out for an hour and the guys were great  ###  if you go on this , bring some cash , as there are not only opportunities to thank them financially for their hard work , but they offer a cd of dominican music with a personalized cd cover with a small bottle of local rum  ###  also to get to the horses you pass the shopping area  ###  yes , the vendors can be a little pushy if you let them , and the rumor is that the price offered is not the price paid , so negotiating skills might be called into play  ###  we attended spanish lessons most days  ###  inez was our favorite teacher  ###  our spanish skills improved significantly as the week went on  ###  i went to the gym most days  ###  it is up near the front gate behind the disco , and is new and clean and has excellent equipment for aerobic conditioning ( ellipticals , treadmills , and some slider - type of stairmaster ) as well as all the weight machines and free weights  ###  at around 12:30 each day , on the beach , they cook lunch  ###  it is outstanding  ###  we had beef fajitas , dominican rice , and a seafood and pasta dish that were all big - time good  ###  hit the kafe caf? for a drink , and the ice cream machine at kafe caf? for dessert and you have a fresh , local lunch treat  ###  there was also a hot dog cart at one of the pool bars , and pizza was available for delivery to your lounge chair , so if you didn?? want to get dry and go to one of restaurants , lunch was not an issue , with several choices available  ###  on to the restaurants  ###  
80	a good vacation but some problems given the other reviews we did not have high expectations for our trip to the barcelo premium but we did have some expectations given the four apple rating this property received from apple vacations ( who we booked through )  ###  on the whole we did have a good time but there were a number of issues that may put off many people  ###  we feel this resort is quite average and compared to the two gran bahia principe all inclusive properties we have visited this resort pales in comparison ( i realize the two should not be directly compared as we payed about 30% less for the barcelo premium )  ###  so first the good points : the beach is one of the best that i 've ever seen if you want to walk along the beach and just generally chill out in or around the ocean  ###  beautiful soft sand and very clean  ###  this was the highlight of our vacation  ###  the pool and pool area were nice and kept clean  ###  bars were good and generally had good service  ###  make sure to try a mama juana pina colada  ###  quick run down of a la cart restaurants : dominican - we loved the soups and mafongo  ###  seafood was very overcooked and did not taste all that fresh  ###  the guinea hen was generally good  ###  service was a bit strange as related later  ###  overall we 'd recommend this restaurant as a way to try some dominican cuisine  ###  italian - food was good for this resort but not of any great quality  ###  you 'll get much better food at an olive garden  ###  service was good  ###  try the champagne ( applies to all locations in resort ) as i thought it was much better than the included red and white wines  ###  french - we ate here twice and had generally good experiences  ###  the best dish we had was the salmon  ###  there is a cheese bar at the this restaurant  ###  food was highly variable but generally good  ###  recommendedjapanese/tepanyaki - if you have never had tepanyaki ( show grilling ) than you 'll probably love this restaurant  ###  if you 've been to other tepanyaki restaurants you 'll probably be disappointed with the show aspect  ###  chef tried very hard but it was obvious that he had not received very much training  ###  food was pretty good and was some of the best during our stay  ###  recommended but do not expect too much from the show  ###  sake is available and is of ok quality  ###  issues : (it 's going to sound like i 'm complaining a lot here but this is what we experienced , some of it bothered us , some of it did not , consider how it would impact you )  ###  water : water pressure , hot and cold water fluctuated throughout our stay  ###  many days we did not have any hot water , sometimes we did not have any running water , and other times we only had scalding hot water  ###  electricity : there were several power outages during our stay  ###  this also contributed to the water problems  ###  highly variable service : the service that we experienced at this resort was highly variable  ###  some of this was at times due to language barrier since our spanish is minimal  ###  that said we ran into some great individuals and some that were so poor that we could not believe it  ###  maid service and mini bar service were generally quite good  ###  front desk service was poor to ok  ###  service at the bars was generally good and restaurant service varied wildly  ###  this resort needs to work on consistency of service  ###  perhaps one of the worst experiences was at the dominican restaurant  ###  we were seated and a gentleman came to take our orders  ###  we had questions about the menu and asked about what was in different items  ###  he would explain what was in an item but then assume we wanted it , writing it down  ###  we would then ask about another item and he would look annoyed because he had to change what he had written  ###  this went on for a few minutes and we finally had everything figured out and he repeated everything back to us including our drink selections  ###  he left and after about ten minutes we still only had water at our table and the first course arrived  ###  during the whole meal the person who took our order along with three or four other individuals were standing in the corner of the restaurant doing nothing  ###  when the waiter arrived with the first course he looked at us puzzled and asked if we wanted any drinks  ###  despite speaking less english than the person who took our order he was able to get the drink orders correct , we watched him go ahead and make the drinks himself , while the others stood around , and brought them back to us within a few minutes  ###  we watched as he took care of almost every aspect of service for everyone in the restaurant while his coworkers just stood there  ###  this lead to generally slow service because he was forced to do everything  ###  we were dumbfounded by the lack of effort displayed by the other individuals  ###  and so it goes that we had some of the best and worst service in the same restaurant at the same time  ###  i believe this is a stellar example of what barcelo needs to correct  ###  front desk/restaurant issues : when we checked in we were handed three receipts with prebooked restaurant reservations  ###  there was no concern for when or where we wanted to eat  ###  we wanted to change these reservations immediately after we saw them but the front desk refused to do so  ###  we ended up getting to try a number of restaurants but because of this system we did not get to try the seafood restaurant that we had wanted to  ###  i complained to guest services and they told me the bookings could be changed at check him  ###  i indicated the front desk had not let us do so  ###  one of a number of examples of different policies being followed by different individuals  ###  overall the restaurant booking system would work if they allowed you to change the reservations at check in but this was very much a point of annoyance because of the way it was handled  ###  food quality : i think i can sum this up by saying that after getting back to the usa we enjoyed eating at hardee 's  ###  the food quality and variety was generally not very good  ###  we never went hungry but given the apple rating of this resort we expected better  ###  the food ( with some exceptions ) was not even of the quality we would expect from an old country buffet or similar here in the states  ###  this was unfortunately true in both the a la carte restaurants and the buffet  ###  variety was minimal and we were sick of the buffet by the last day despite having eaten at a la carte restaurants for dinner on five nights  ###  sometimes we were just baffled by what we received , the best example being a fish terrine appetizer we ordered  ###  when it arrived it turned out to be what looked to us like fish and chips ( fried fish sticks and french fries )  ###  finally on the food front is that during our stay both myself and my wife developed digestive issues including diarrhea  ###  we are not sure what caused the problems but the issues persisted significantly after leaving the dr  ###  we have traveled quite a bit including mexico , china , thailand , and numerous other places and this was by far the worst food related problems that we have had  ###  we never drank anything except bottle water so this was not directly water related  ###  room issues : air conditioning was very loud ( but worked well ) and the toilet ran continuously which contributed to ambient noise levels  ###  we decided this might be a good thing as once we had people in the rooms adjacent to ours we realized it was easy to hear what was going on in other rooms  ###  during our stay we also had a major water leak from the room above into our bathroom  ###  this resulted in our bathroom being mostly unusable until the problem was resolved  ###  that said maintenance fixed this problem relatively quickly and the issue did not recur  ###  
80	disappointing not as good as presented by trip advisor reviewers  ###  before every trip , i review the comments and ratings provided on this site for my desired destination  ###  the data compiled on this site has proven very accurate in the past  ###  sure you can get some overly positive or negative reviews but usually you can pick up trends to help you understand what the resort is really like  ###  for the first time , i have found that the information provided by the majority of the reviewers for the majestic resort does not match what i experienced first hand  ###  normally , i would not provide my own review because i would only be repeating what had been said by other reviewers  ###  but in this case , i felt it necessary to balance things out a little and perhaps save some other innocent travelers the great feelings of disappointment that my family and i felt during our trip to the majestic  ###  but then again , if mosquitos , musty smelling water damaged rooms , worn out recreational equipment , dirty fitness room , poorly constructed buildings , unhelpful front desk personnel , noisy outside closet doors , unprofessional night time entertainment , and last but not least food that will probably make you ill is your thing then this is the place to go  ###  if you are lucky , you might get one of the good rooms  ###  they must exist because reviewers have documented how if you complain loud and hard enough they will move you to another better room  ###  unfortunately , we did not have such luck  ###  basic information : duration of vacation was one week  ###  starting december 27, 2007 and ending january 3, 2008  ###  the weather was pretty good  ###  plenty of hot temperatures for water activity and just a little rain on one day  ###  stayed in room 1337  ###  so , that 's building number 1 on the third floor in room 37  ###  it should be noted that there are 4 buildings and for the most part they are only 3 stories high  ###  but in spots there are 4 floors  ###  our room was in one of the locations were there was another floor above us  ###  first , i will start with positives that are not directly related to the resort  ###  the beach was and is amazing  ###  also the water is pretty rough  ###  i like that because i find it fun to frolic in the waves  ###  so did my son  ###  however , this can be viewed as negative for families with young children  ###  it can be very dangerous  ###  two adults drowned on december 28th  ###  so you have to be careful  ###  this occurred off the beach at the excellence  ###  for the record , the excellence is quite a distance north of the majestic  ###  the water was rough as far as i could walk in both north and south directions  ###  i enjoy walking the beach  ###  i walked both north for an hour on one day and south for an hour another day and in both cases never reached the end of the beach  ###  this leads to the next group of positives , items directly related to the resort  ###  i liked where the resort was located  ###  to the south there is resort after resort and to the north you can walk on the beach where they are a couple of resorts then new a giant resort that 's under construction and eventually parts where there are no resorts at all  ###  just wild beach with all sorts of garbage laying around  ###  i counted two refrigerators a basketball and hundreds of plastic bottles  ###  i liked the beach but not the garbage  ###  i ca not blame the majestic for that however  ###  lobby is very attractive  ###  the grounds at the majestic are very nicely landscaped  ###  the pool is large and it is worked into the grounds in a way that is very appealing  ###  generally , the grounds are kept pretty clean  ###  i was happy with the cleaning staff with regards to daily maid service  ###  we were there for new year 's and the fireworks display was good  ###  also , the new year 's buffet was well done  ###  i ca not speak about all the rooms but the variant that we had was very spacious and most everything worked as it should  ###  no blocked drains , broken toilets , leaky taps , etc  ###  as reported in other reviews  ###  oops , sorry there was a problem with the balcony door not always closing and locking properly  ###  note : air conditioner is designed to only operate when door is closed and locked  ###  our room had a partial ocean view and it was no where near the construction site  ###  now for the negatives  ###  the room was the biggest disappointment  ###  very musty smelling  ###  obvious water damage to ceiling and arch over the jacuzzi  ###  once upon a time , water from the 4th floor unit above must have leaked down and the resulting damage was never fixed  ###  another interesting initial observation upon entering the room was that there were many squashed mosquitos on the ceiling and various walls  ###  my wife had asked for a ( cot ) for our son , in the event we could not get 2 double beds  ###  as it turned out the room did have 2 double beds but the resort gave us the cot anyway  ###  we did not need nor use the cot  ###  the cot is actually a single mattress and box spring  ###  the set in our room was dirty and ragged  ###  considering it 's condition , i would have had a difficult time using it  ###  as stated in the positives , the room was big and had a desk and chair as well as a sofa  ###  the chair was was stained and dirty  ###  the sofa was blocked by the cot and we never used it  ###  for the record , it looked in need of replacing and i saw them bringing in new ones but we never got one  ###  at night , there was a constant banging noise  ###  i eventually tracked down the cause and fixed it  ###  there are utility closets in the hallway that the maids use and i guess some closets provide access to pipes and wires  ###  at night , it is very windy causing the closet doors to bang loudly  ###  i saw down the hall that someone else had stuck a folded up napkin into the space between the closet door and the frame  ###  i did the same for the closets near our room and this solved the problem until someone needed to open the closets  ###  i had to do it a couple of times throughout the week  ###  even though we arrived very late , after seeing and smelling the room , we asked to change rooms  ###  we were given the old line that it was impossible because the place was full  ###  the person at the front desk suggested that we try again in the morning  ###  
80	good value , great hotel and grounds , ok food punta cana is a tropical paradise  ###  we stayed at the all - inclusive , all - adult secrets excellence resort , in november 2006  ###  it 's about an hour from the airport  ###  we heard that the resort would cease to be part of the secrets chain in january of '07 ( i believe secrets is building a new resort in punta cana in '08) , with the existing resort possibly becoming part of the hedonism chain  ###  semi - strong ocean currents prevent the resort from converting to any of the more family - oriented chains  ###  the airport itself is unique , with the only open - air thatched roof terminal i 've ever seen  ###  the hour 's drive over to the resort from the airport is a little bumpy but tolerable , in air conditioned buses for our apple vacations tour  ###  on this drive you get a good feel for how underdeveloped the country really is , and that 's putting it politically correctly  ###  the resort is gorgeous and impressive  ###  you walk into a massive open - air marble lobby , trimmed with stained wood supports while adorned with stylish wicker furniture  ###  the grounds are well - maintained , well - landscaped , and expansive  ###  sitting in my best 'resort casual ' outfit waiting for dinner in a wicker chair on the polished marble floors next to the wooden bar with a lazy fan twirling overhead and a cocktail in my hand , i told my girlfriend i felt a little like james bond just waiting for octopussy to walk up  ###  after checking in , the stroll to your room is across a covered wooden plankway which traverses a long serene pool filled with koi fish and fountains  ###  we got upgraded to the excellence club with a ground floor room ( the swim - out suite designation is slightly misleading  ###  it 's about a 20 foot walk to the edge of the pool , but we dealt with it lol )  ###  the rooms were pretty big , all marble floors , stucco walls and columns painted in faded tropical colors , darkwood white - washed bar and bathroom , a big two - person jacuzzi tub , large sliding glass doors overlooking the pool , a marble shower , double sinks , oft - restocked mini bar , and a 4- post canopy bed that  ###  was fairly comfortable ( my girl thought it was too hard though )  ###  the 24/7 all - adult channel that comes free with the room will undoubtedly become the running joke of your stay  ###  the only caveat to all these marble and polished ceramic tile floors is watch your step when they get wet , it 'd be easy to break an elbow slipping on a wet spot  ###  the pool is outstanding and the backbone of the resort  ###  more well - designed than any other resort pool i 've seen ( other than maybe the atlantis ' of the world ) , it 's almost more of a lazy river concept ( minus the slow current to transport you )  ###  it 's basically a narrowish winding water trail that traces the outline of the guest room buildings and a couple of the open air restaurants , giving easy pool access regardless of your room location  ###  rafts are readily available for your relaxation , or hit the expansive swim up bar , where a big early tip will get you attention all day and well into your stay  ###  a secondary pool with a cascade waterfall seemed to be a little more serene spot for couples , and there are two semi - secluded large hottubs to take care of those swollen muscles  ###  the beach is also gorgeous by the way , with smallish but slightly rough waves and a little bit of an undertoe , but still swimable on all but the worst of days  ###  the water is clean and mostly clear with some minor sand churning , but if you 're dead set on that crystal clear azure blue water you see on carribean commercials , you may want to go elsewhere  ###  there is a series of nice shops along the winding driveway ( but heed the warnings of gouging on basic sundries like suntan lotion and bug spray - -they 're $15- $20 a bottle , so bring full bottles from home )  ###  plus there 's a very serene modern spa decorated in light colors , marble and hardwood floors , and gurgling fountains built into the walkways  ###  i 'd highly recommend the midnight massage , which is a couples massage given in a raised open - air hut right on the beach , and can be scheduled for any time of day  ###  worth the $250, very relaxing and accompanied by the sound of the waves crashing on the sand less than 50 feet away  ###  there is an ok - sized disco with good lighting and sound systems  ###  it 's decorated a little like an upscale strip club , which is to say it 's a little dark , has marble floors ( careful again with drinks on the dance floor ) , and a bit of zebra - print fabric here and there  ###  the music is an inconsistent mix of dominican and somewhat - dated american dance music  ###  they played a 'good ' dance tune about 1 in every 3, so we still whooped it up on the dance floor a couple of nights  ###  there is a serviceable open - air sports bar for those must - see football games , but they only have about 4 tvs and i 'm not sure how extensive their satellite coverage is ( plus how do you convey do you have the penn state vs  ###  to someone with limited english who has no idea what network they 're on or what their uniforms look like  ###  they show monday night football on a projection screen right on the beach during football season which was pretty cool  ###  the nightly shows put on by the staff pretty much sucked , but the karaoke night with guests from the crowd was pretty entertaining and funny at times  ###  despite some other reviews i read , i did not think the vendors who put up tables in the lobby at night were that aggressive  ###  but then again i 'm from philly , so i 'm sure it 's all relative  ###  overall the service at the resort ranged from ok to excellent  ###  the excellence club staff was very helpful  ###  a few of the bartenders and restaurant staff were very outgoing and fun  ###  despite what your travel agent might say , tipping makes this place tick and your service will be dictated by it in some cases  ###  the maid service was very good  ###  most of the staff spoke serviceable - to - good english  ###  there 's a whole schedule of activities on any given day , so it 's easy to amuse yourself , but tough to leave the watch in the room and fully embrace the who cares what time it is mindset  ###  the crowd was pretty varied and friendly , and nobody seemed overly uptight  ###  our large group of 16 got a little rowdy around the pool bars a couple of afternoons , and not only did nobody complain , we usually had a bemused audience for our antics  ###  the beach and pool area are technically topless , but most of the repressed americans did not partake  ###  topless sunbathing seemed to be a little more popular on the less - crowded beach and at the cascade pool , and moreso earlier in the morning  ###  we met people from manchester england , chicago , st  ###  louis , norfolk , misissippi , and quite a few from the philly/new jersey area  ###  this place is a pretty good value  ###  we did a 5- night stay through apple with airfare from philly for 2 for under $3000 including tips , souvineir shopping , and drinks on the plane  ###  just in case you have not figured it out yet , you do not go all - inclusive for the quality of the food , and this was no exception  ###  people 's reaction to this obvious aspect of midscale - priced all - inclusives never ceases to amuse me  ###  everyone raves about the value of the prices both before , during , and after the trip  ###  yet during and after nearly every meal while you 're there , nobody can ever seem to stop complaining about the food  ###  the food at secrets excellence punta cana ranged from not great to ok , with one or two dishes rating as pretty good  ###  pack a few casual elegance outfits for the restaurants ( meaning pants for the men )  ###  the best meal on the lot by far is the chateaubriand ( filet ) , at the frech restaurant called bourdeaux  ###  the mexican/dominican place was good  ###  one or two dishes at the italian place were ok  ###  i heard mixed reviews on the asian place  ###  other than that , the food offerings were not all that great  ###  lunch will likely be a starchy buffet , a burger from one of the pool bars , or wood oven pizza from room service ( delivered to the pool of course )  ###  neither of these are very good either , but after all morning at the swim - up bar , who 's going to complain  ###  i mean the stuff is edible , just tastes a little different than back home , and you 're generally not running back for a second helping  ###  my only complaint was the mosquitos  ###  despite spraying down with off  ###  every night , my girlfriend arrived back home with 87 ( yes , she counted ) mosquito bites  ###  they seem to get bad just after sunset and go mainly for the legs , ankles , and feet  ###  bring a couple bottles of a strong mosquito repellent ( standard off  ###  did not do the trick )  ###  other than that , i never saw a single roach or bug that i 've read in other reviews , just a few cute little salamaders  ###  from what my travel agent said , casa de campo ( pete dye 's teeth of the dog ) is a world class golf course about a 90 minute ( one way ) cab ride which costs about $90 ( one way ) from secrets  ###  the greens fees are over $300 i think  ###  despite being an avid golfer and a course collector , it did not seem worth killing most of a day in paradise and spending upwards of $500 to play one round , even if it was casa de campo  ###  i think it might be semi - close to the airport if you want to hit there before heading to the resort  ###  
80	relaxing and romantic vacation my girlfriend and i are both around 30  ###  i booked the trip through vacation express and i booked the airfare separate through spirit  ###  i saved $1,000 by doing this  ###  vacation express was less expensive compared to orbitz and expedia  ###  we were in punta cana from april 17-24  ###  the trip was absolutely awesome and we wish we had book for 10 days  ###  i will go into detail about the resort  ###  first , the ride from the punta cana airport is bumpy and a little wild  ###  the drivers definitely have their own style  ###  i had been to punta cana before and i rode the bus to the resort  ###  the bus ride is horrible , because you have to wait for everyone to get on the bus before leaving the airport  ###  then the bus will make two or three stops at other resorts  ###  so for this trip , i knew there was no way i was riding the bus  ###  we pre - booked online with dominican airport transfers  ###  it cost a few extra dollars , but it is definitely worth it  ###  we landed at the airport at 1:05 p  ###  on thursday , april 17  ###  we got our luggage and was in the car on our way to the resort at 1:30  ###  we arrived at the resort at 2:15 p  ###  other people staying at the resort spoke of the hour wait at the airport before leaving and then the 1 hour and 30 min ride to the resort because of the stops  ###  next , the hotel staff was exceptional  ###  the people worked very hard to make sure everyone was confortable  ###  tips are not required , but if you ca not afford to tip these people then stay at home  ###  there are people there that do not tip and these are the people that complain about everything  ###  you are in a 3rd world country  ###  this is not a place to go for neiman marcus or saks fifth avenue shopping  ###  if you are looking to relax and enjoy your lover this is the place  ###  no children being around makes for a wonderful , peaceful , relaxing vacation  ###  we got a masters suite with pool view  ###  i am definitely glad we got a masters suite over a junior suite  ###  the difference between the rooms is there is a double balcony with the masters suite and there is also a separate room from the bedroom  ###  we did not spend a lot of time in the room during the day sitting , but the extra space was very nice  ###  the rooms are not 5 star , but the rooms are very nice and very clean  ###  housekeeping did an excellent job of keeping the rooms very neat  ###  the lady would always fold our clothes and was in the room once in the morning and once in the evening  ###  the power did go out a couple of times while we were there  ###  again this is part of life in the dominican republic  ###  it was only out for twenty minutes each time  ###  the food is not horrible like some say it is  ###  i live in atlanta , georgia  ###  my girlfriend and i eat at very nice restaurants regularly like mortons of chicago , prime , two urban licks , and etc  ###  again you have to be open to realizing you are in another country  ###  the food is not exceptional , but it is not horrible either  ###  the best restaurant is the french  ###  there was a wait usually every night  ###  who cares if there is a wait  ###  have an extra cocktail and relax  ###  there are always people that forget that dominican time is slow  ###  the steakhouse is good , but remember to ask the server to put the sauce on the side  ###  the breakfast buffet is o  ###  breakfast was my least favorite meal  ###  the lobster house breakfast was good  ###  the lunch buffet is very good and it changes everyday  ###  the lobster house for dinner was probably the worst restaurant  ###  the lobsters are constantly undercooked becuase they grill them  ###  if the lobsters are cooked correctly , they are very good  ###  people forget that the lobsters served in punta cana are warm water lobsters  ###  most people are used to eating cold water lobster  ###  there is a difference  ###  the pizza served by the pool is very good  ###  two nights while we were there , special dinners were cooked on the beach  ###  these meals were very good featuring some dominican specialties  ###  the mexican restaurant was o  ###  the best thing in the mexican place is the fajitas  ###  the asian restaurant was very good  ###  we did not eat at the italian restaurant or order room servicethe entertainment was very good some nights and not so good other nights  ###  the michael jackson show is really good  ###  i am not a fan of michael jackson , but the entertainers really put on a show  ###  the guy that plays michael jackson plays at several resorts  ###  he is almost like a local celebrity  ###  he arrives in a motor home and puts on an excellent show  ###  the karoke night was also very entertaining  ###  the disco was fun some nights while we were there  ###  we just like to chill so we never minded this  ###  the pool is exceptional  ###  we met a lot of couples at the pool that will probably be lifelong friends  ###  we are actually going to see four couples we met from ohio over the summer  ###  the pool bar has really good service  ###  do not forget to bring some money to the pool  ###  the service is exceptional with very good name brands available  ###  
80	very enjoyable my wife and i just returned from a stay at excellence punta cana and we had a great time  ###  rooms : we stayed in a garden view room  ###  the view was of a small garden area and the back of the main building  ###  it was not a great view , but quite frankly , i was not there to look out the window  ###  the room had a slight mold/musty smell  ###  however , it was not enough to bother us much  ###  the bed was hard but comfortable  ###  the shower had great water pressure and warm/hot water was plentiful  ###  the in - room jacuzzi was great and relaxing  ###  food : the food was generally good  ###  breakfast and lunch at the tuscan were buffet style  ###  these were good , but not great  ###  breakfast at the lobster house was sit down and was better  ###  they had a few egg dishes that were very tasty  ###  lunch at the grille was also sit down and was better than the tuscan  ###  i had a shrimp dish that was particularly good as well as a steak kebob  ###  dinner was generally a step up in quality  ###  the tuscan was probably the weakest restaurant of all  ###  spice had good asian food  ###  the lobster house was also good - however , if you do not like lobster - you 're going to be very hungry  ###  we liked barcelona the best and ate their two times  ###  we ordered room service one morning and it was ok  ###  we ordered the food the night before and it was delivered right on time the following morning  ###  the french toast was not amazing , but not awful either  ###  bottom line , you wo not go hungry  ###  the husband of the couple we travelled with was a vegetarian and he was able to find acceptable meals as well  ###  service at all of the restaurants was a bit slow  ###  expect a meal to take an hour to and hour and a half  ###  the resort : the resort is very pretty  ###  the beach is beautiful  ###  the ocean is definitely not tranquil  ###  the first couple of days we were there , the weather was a bit stormy and the wind was very strong  ###  as a result , the waves were considerable  ###  we did a little body boarding  ###  even once the weather turned nice , the waves were still large and frequent  ###  in front of the lobby , there is a small lagoon with flamingoes , ducks , turkeys , and two parrots  ###  beware the parrots  ###  they will climb on you and they will eat the buttons off of your clothes  ###  there are turtles in the small pond inside the lobby  ###  the grounds and pool are well maintained and they seem to be doing constant updates  ###  the staff is very friendly and helpful  ###  it was my wife 's birthday and i ordered a cake for her  ###  the cake was promptly delivered to us at the restaurant  ###  in addition , they decorated our room with ballons  ###  many of the guests smoke , so if this is a problem for you , you will have problems at some of the activities/events  ###  it is very important to note that the resort is an hour away from the airport  ###  it is also an hour away from some of the excursions  ###  do not go to this resort if you are looking to be in the middle of the action  ###  activities : do not take the bike tour  ###  it is a waste of time and not very pretty  ###  the horse excursion is excellent - they take you on a 1/2 hour to 1 hour trip  ###  we took the streching and aerobics class every morning and they were generally good and fun  ###  we also made good use of the volleyball court on the beach , the clay tennis courts , the ping pong ball and pool tables  ###  the night club is pleasant , but do not expect to hear anything from earlier than 2000  ###  they play a mix of latin , hip hop and carribean music  ###  we went on the snorkeling excursion and had a great time  ###  the coral reef we went to was filled with fish and very scenic  ###  we also snorkeled with some nurse sharks and stingrays in an enclosed area  ###  that was interesting as well  ###  we did not do the atv trip  ###  however , we talked to some people who did and they said the trip was fantastic so long as you were willing to get covered in mud  ###  my wife used the spa twice and said it was excellent  ###  i used the exercise room a couple of times  ###  the equipment is good , but unfortunately they do not have any tvs in the room  ###  in addition , the exercise room is upstairs and not air - conditioned  ###  as a result it is very hot  ###  expect to loose some serious weight  ###  entertainmentthe entertainment is acceptable  ###  i was not expecting much and so i was not dissapointed  ###  the magic act was polished , however , he did not do any original trics  ###  we spent most of the time figuring out the secret 's beind the tricks  ###  the dance shows were high energy and reasonably entertaining  ###  the singer chris blizzard was ok , but do not expect him to sing anything other than ballads and easy listening  ###  the piano bar was also not that great  ###  one of the gentlemen we met was actually a professional piano bar player in texas  ###  he played a few songs and was much better than the person the resort hired  ###  i would not go to one of these resorts if you are looking for great entertainment  ###  we knew what we were in for , we set our expectations low and were pleasantly surprised  ###  overallwe had a fantastic time  ###  the resort met all of our expectations  ###  
80	signs of aging but full of beauty and surprises overall ( my rating : 8 of 10) the excellence punta cana : like a mature lover , showing signs of age , but full of beautiful experience and surprises  ###  this is an excellent ( no pun intended ) resort  ###  there are several areas in need of refurbishment  ###  however , the activities are plentiful , the staff is extraordinarily gracious , the food ( in some restaurants ) was superb , and the pool was so fabulous that even this workaholic found himself relaxing in no time  ###  backgroundmy wife and i spent our wedding anniversary at the excellence punta cana from saturday , november 29 through friday , december 5  ###  we were looking for an all - inclusive island getaway  ###  beau nanni at the road less travelled suggested that because it was an anniversary vacation that we consider the adults - only excellence punta cana  ###  we finalized our decision only after reading the traveler reviews here at tripadvisor and being pleased with the quoted price relative to most all - inclusive of a similar nature  ###  airport transferprieto tours managed our transportation to and from the excellence  ###  the ride to and from the resort takes approximately 75-85 minutes  ###  the roads in punta cana range from three - car - lengths wide , paved , and lined ( near the airport ) to one - car - length wide , unpaved , and unlined  ###  our driver slowed down considerably and coasted slowly over the divots and rocky patches  ###  for those with motion sickness or anxiety , i might suggest an antiemetic ( e  ###  , bonine/dramamine )  ###  i had taken something anyway ( because of the flight ) so i found the ride from the airport to be more psychologically jarring ( relative to suburban american infrastructure ) than physically jarring  ###  weatherthe weather was perfect with the low never falling below 72f/22c and the high never climbing above 85f/29c  ###  there were brief sunrise showers on 3 of 7 mornings and a brief evening shower on 2 of 7 nights  ###  aside from that , the humidity was moderate and the breeze off the ocean was delightful particularly during the sunny early afternoons when sunbathing  ###  mosquitoes were not an issue during our stay  ###  however , your experience may differ and i would suggest coming prepared with at least 1 small (1 fl  ###  oz or 30 ml ) bottle per person of 100% deet per person per week  ###  accommodations ( my rating : 7 of 10) we had an ocean view from our excellence club building 10 second floor room  ###  our view of the ocean was good , but not spectacular as the rooms are not actually that close to the ocean  ###  the main pool and palm tree foliage sat between our room and the ocean  ###  however , after reviewing the layout of the hotel , i surmise that our ocean view was probably one of the best  ###  our room had a beautiful ancient indigenous design , spacious , and comfortable  ###  other reviewers noted an ant and mosquito problem  ###  we had no flying insects in our room  ###  we did notice approximately 0-2 ants per day on the bathroom floor  ###  nothing of concern  ###  the room furniture was adequate and the safe was large ( not laptop large but 2 portable dvd players large )  ###  the balcony furniture was a nice luxury especially in the early morning and the evening  ###  our balcony screen door was broken upon our arrival , they fixed it within hours of my calling down  ###  housekeeping ( my rating : 4 of 10) the minibar was stocked and restocked daily  ###  one day i left a note and a tip with a special request that was granted with friendly reply note  ###  daily room cleaning was inconsistent with regard to timing and quality  ###  there was more than one occasion when i had to call down for an extra face cloth or towel to be delivered during the evening turn down service  ###  beach ( my rating : 6 of 10) soft luxurious sand , plenty of beach chairs , special cabanas ( if you could get their early ) , beautiful water and big waves  ###  it is an idyllic beach for watching the tide roll in and reading a book , but the waves were too strong and too big for any swimming or deep frolicking  ###  do not go too far pass the end of the resort on the side furthest from the lobby  ###  once you go 100 meters past nancy 's market , you 're on your own because there are no more resorts or hotel on the beach in that direction for miles  ###  if you want to explore the beach beyond the excellence go the other direction ( past the excursions/water sports hut )  ###  main swimming pool ( my rating : 10 of 10) there are two pools , but i only spent time at the main pool  ###  the main pool is in a word fun  ###  there are three bars between the plaza/ beginning of the pool and the end of the pool  ###  there are plenty of beach chairs , two - person cabanas , and floating mats with drink holders  ###  the water was fine , but i spent most of my time by the pool reading , resting , and taking full advantage of the pool waiter service  ###  someone came by to ask if i wanted a drink at least once every 60 minutes and between 1 pm and 3:30 pm , there is a waiter who walks around with hot pizza delivery  ###  if they had someone from 9am - 11 am delivering donuts , i would have been in heaven  ###  activities and entertainment ( my rating : 8 of 10) daily : bike tours , horseback riding ( free 30 min per guest per stay ) , yoga , aerobics , spanish lessons , diving lessons , volleyball , water polo , and more  ###  nightly : live music , shows , theme dance partiessuggested highlights : saxophone player , featured music and dance performances ( e  ###  , rewind 70s and 80s and michael jackson shows )  ###  the michael jackson show is silly ( especially the pre - show ) and the song selection is weak largely because dangerous is simply jam and smooth criminal remixed together and since they feature all three songs it feels monotonous but aside from that the michael jackson show is too kitschy to miss  ###  spa , gym , and sports ( my rating : 8 of 10) the spa ( located between the mini market and the disco ) is around the corner from the gym , tennis courts , basketball court , shooting range , archery range , and sports bar with billiard tables , foosball , darts , and ping pong  ###  my wife partook of the spa on several occasions and was very impressed with the facility  ###  there are different spa specials every day  ###  you can find the spa specials list at the spa  ###  pick up a price list and the weekly specials list on day one so you can plan ahead your spa bookings  ###  the gym has state - of - the - art new equipment , full nautilus , free - weights , four treadmills , and several bikes and step - machines  ###  the music is pumping , the closed captioning is on the televisions and there is a personal trainer there available for many of the prime hours during the day  ###  the gym is spacious , well - kept , staffed , and smells wonderful ( which is unusual for a gym )  ###  i love working out and i loved that gym  ###  the tennis courts (2 caliche - clay and 1 hard ) and basketball court are in excellent shape  ###  however , the other sport facilities were in various states of disrepair  ###  one ping - pong table was good and the other was miserable  ###  one pool - table was okay and the other was miserable  ###  the upkeep of the sports and activity facilities , tables and equipment around the sports bar are in desperate need of renovations  ###  the best surprise of the trip for me was the tennis facility and rolando , the tennis pro  ###  i play tennis regularly and have played ( albeit poorly ) in local leagues  ###  i have received tennis instructor from at least 6 different instructors in my life time  ###  rolando was by far the best ( even with the language difference )  ###  rolando was 1/3 the cost of private 1 hour lessons in my area ( however i live in a wealthy suburb between new york and philadelphia ) and was better then all of them  ###  i learned more and had more fun working with rolando in three days than i have with any instruction i 've had in the last three years  ###  if you play tennis and want to hit with a pro while you 're there , find rolando , and he has the newest top of the line prince racquets for you to borrow  ###  food ( my rating : 7 of 10) barcelona ( mediterranean/spanish ) , chez isabelle ( french ) , the agave ( mexican ) , toscano ( finer italian ) , spice ( chinese/japanese/thai ) , lobster house ( just lobster ) , the grill ( steakhouse ) , oregano ( common italian - pizza and pasta )  ###  you know they take their service seriously when you see the staff line up at 6 am for instructions  ###  tastes vary and with that caveat  ###  the agave was excellent mexican fare in a quiet understated environment  ###  try the tres leche you wo not be disappointed  ###  spice has the most fabulous decor and wonderful asian dining choices  ###  
80	believe what you read - both good and bad just got back from the gran bahia principe ( feb  ###  2- 8) and here is the deal : in general : ?  ###  problems : most of the *problems* are a result of the resort being ??verbooked?  ###  this is pretty inexcusable and due to either incompetence or greed on the part of the resort  ###  we were traveling with two other parties and had made reservations/requests 9 months ago to have our rooms together ( two families with toddlers and their grandmother )  ###  we were able to get in the same building , but on different floors  ###  out of 1,700 rooms , we could not get 3 rooms together despite several requests and greasing the front desk clerk $10  ###  in fact , while we were there they were offering people $200 a day and/or free excursions for guests who were willing to relocate to another resort  ###  i?? not sure how the other resort ( s ) compare to this one as we did not want to chance moving all three parties  ###  the sense that i got was that most of the staff try to be friendly and helpful but they are just so overwhelmed that many/most requests just fall through the cracks  ###  whenever we needed something ( cribs for the babies , bell hops for luggage , more water or beer for the room etc  ###  ) we generally had to ask 3-4 different people and even then it was 50/50 whether or not you?? get it  ###  layout : the place is huge and somewhat confusing due to its ??win?  ###  the gran bahia principe has a ??avaro?  ###  and a ??unta cana?  ###  side which mirror each other and have separate lobbies , restaurants etc  ###  in addition , they??e recently added an adults - only section called ??mbar?  ###  which further confuses the newly arrived  ###  we checked in on the punta cana side but due to overbooking , were placed in a building on the ??avaro?  ###  no big deal as far as i can tell , the location was actually very close to the beach ?  ###  it just took us a couple of days to figure out the whole layout  ###  getting around : the resort is organized with the lobby/main buffet on one end and the beach/main pool on the other end  ###  there are trolleys ( mini trucks with passenger trailers in tow ) that operate throughout the day , but you can walk the entire distance in about 10-15 minutes  ###  as most people have said , the grounds are extremely well kept and clean  ###  to the point that you can?? help but wish that they would spend less on the grounds crew and more on things like guest services staff etc  ###  the beach and pool areas are very nice  ###  getting chairs/towels is no problem , although if you are traveling with children and want key areas with shade you need to get out there by 8 or so and reserve some chairs  ###  the staff , while overwhelmed , is mostly very friendly  ###  yes there is a language barrier and you should brush up on your spanish , but generally they are friendly ( especially the buffet staff with children ?  ###  they were super nice to our toddlers )  ###  let?? face it ?  ###  you??e going there for sun and warmth and that?? what you??e going to get  ###  even the couple of days where it rained , it?? usually just a short rain shower ( or several ) and then back to blue skies  ###  during our stay it was in the low 80?? during the day and low 70?? at night  ###  generally you didn?? have to wait long to get a drink pretty much everywhere  ###  there are bars in the lobby , a couple by the pool , at the pool snack bar and in the theatre if there is an event going on there  ###  you can also get alcoholic drinks in the main buffet  ###  the busiest bar seems to be pool bar , and often it was quicker to duck into the one in the snack bar close by  ###  the lobby is huge and a great place to hang out before or after meals or just to have coffee or a drink at night  ###  as many have noted , the food is really not that good  ###  the main buffet is in the lobby and has pretty much the same thing for breakfast and lunch and a different theme every night for dinner  ###  there is a pretty wide selection and you can *generally* find something to fill you up , but you won?? find yourself looking forward to meal times  ###  you??l find that breakfast is your favorite meal as it?? hard to screw up an omelet or a bowl of cereal or a pancake etc  ###  many people go to the snack bar near the pool/beach for lunch , which is also a buffet and has the same mediocre stuff every day ( chicken , french fries , hot dogs , hamburgers , cold cuts , small pasta bar and some fruit )  ###  i felt guilty for letting so much food go to waste , but you have to get/try about 10 things to find the one or two that are actually edible  ###  ala carte restaurants  ###  scheduling your 3 meals at the ala carte restaurants is a nightmare  ###  from the minute the guest services office is open it is swamped with people trying to make a reservation  ###  you??l most likely not get to eat at the time you want or at the restaurants that you want , which is unfortunate as the food in the two restaurants that we were able to get into ( italian and french ) were much better than the buffet  ###  certainly not the same as ??ine dining?  ###  in the states , but pretty good  ###  if you have a toddler that requires a nap , try not to get a room on the ground floor  ###  the maids always come in the afternoon and are very noisy ?  ###  yelling at each other and perpetually moving furniture around in the rooms above you  ###  asking them to try to be quiet or to come back later will not get you very far  ###  in addition , you??l hear the trolleys , vans and scooters outside of your room for the better part of the day and night  ###  traveling with two other parties it was interesting to see the difference in maid service  ###  we left money out ( $2- $5) every day and would occasionally ask for extra water or more beer for the mini bar in the room  ###  generally we didn?? find much of a correlation between leaving a tip and getting any special treatment  ###  usually we wouldn?? get what we requested and one day we came home to find that the maid had taken all of our old towels ( which we had left hanging which means ??on?? take?  ###  and had not left us any new ones  ###  after asking 2-3 times for some towels i had to locate a maid cart and ??orrow?  ###  my sister and brother in law on the other hand were getting extra beer and water , bubble baths drawn with flower petals , balloons in the room etc  ###  in sum , it really comes down to who you get for a maid and how much they want to take care of you  ###  helpful hints?  ###  bring an insulated mug  ###  this tip absolutely saved my vacation  ###  otherwise , all your drinks ( alcoholic or otherwise ) come in thimble size plastic cups which you can drink while you??e waiting for your next drink  ###  it will also keep your drink cold while you hang on the beach or by the pool  ###  ask for the room safe when you check in ( about $25 for the week )  ###  we were not asked if we wanted one when we checked in and had to go back the next day and wait in the considerable check - in line to get one  ###  it is simple to use and good peace of mind for your valuables  ###  bring $25- $50 in singles for tips for waiters , bartenders and maids  ###  they are generally not expected and won?? get you much if any special treatment , but they are appreciated  ###  spend time early on to walk the entire complex and figure out the layout  ###  this will make the rest of your stay more enjoyable  ###  watch out for the airport vultures  ###  they will accost you as you??e leaving the airport and insist on carrying your luggage , even though your trip representative ( vip or whoever ) is waiting just a few steps away from them  ###  feel free to use them if you have a lot of luggage and need a hand , but mostly they are just trying to extort some coin from you  ###  similarly , if you don?? like being hounded watch out for the vendors on the inside of the ??illage square?  ###  
80	honeymoon from hell let me start out by saying when i was told about secrets excellence in punta cana on paper it sounded like the dreamvacation we always wanted for our honeymoon  ###  reality set in when we were there to the point we both started a mantra ,  excelente every time something went wrong , all the time wishing our honeymoon would be over  ###  the room - we arrived way past check in time but the room was not ready  ###  thedesk sent us to get lunch and assured us the room would be ready  ###  afterlunch the maids were still not done - they were buffing the floors  ###  which lead my husband to the first trip to the front desk  ###  eventually we got in the room andit looked beautiful and since we had a balcony we stepped out on it to see the view we had requested so many months ago  ###  we got a view of the service building with the help trekking in  out at all hours  ###  the best thing i saw was the same individual spitting each day in front of our building  ###  i went down to ask the desk if we could get a room with a view as we had initiallyasked to get  ###  they explained that the really good rooms were only given to the excellence club to which we could not be a part of  ###  it was not a question of extra money we would have paid  ###  it was just a matter that there were no more people being accepted  ###  so we dealt with that but being in the pool welearned a different truth  ###  people were being upgraded without asking and without paying for it  ###  i still do not know why we could not be a part of that club but i could deal with it if the room was not plagued with some other troubling factors - ants/ power outages and the toilet not flushing and my husband having to physically stick his hand in the top half of the toilet to fix it  ###  the ring - my husband got his wedding ring stolen off his finger while we were getting a massage  ###  he was not used to wearing a ring so hedid not realize it was gone for a few hours  ###  we went back to the spot on the beach where we got the massage  ###  there we were confronted by two guards wielding shotguns  ###  scary - especially since we were trying to convey in broken spanish that we had lost the ring  ###  they allowed us to look and told us all stuff found would be turned into the concierge desk  ###  the next morning my husband went to the conciergewho made a call to the lost and found  ###  they told me they would call around - husband went back to the beach massage place where he watched the guy cleaning up search through the towels  ###  he then went back to the concierge who acted likeit was the first time he told them this  ###  he went down to the spa and continued down to the club  ###  concierge never followed up  ###  it was notexpensive in price but it was in sentimentality  ###  room service -

not a bit of it - due to afore - mentioned room service incident  ###  i was able to eat and got ill the next morning  ###  i also got about 50 bug bites on each leg that kept her up at night even with bug spray on  ###  hospital trip - we were supposed to go on a catamaran excursion but could not because i had to run to the bathroom  ###  i looked pale and was dehydrated so husband called the resort doctor who i think is adoctor like dr  ###  pepper is a doctor , sooo  ###  pepper called medical transport who brought me via wheelchair to medical services where dr  ###  pepper shoved an iv in my wrist to replenish fluids , we traveled via ambulance to the punta canahospital half an hour away  ###  we were told it was a 15 minute ride and wewould need to stay for about 2 hours  ###  we stayed for 8 hours  ###  i gave a blood and urine sample  ###  joyce was told that she probably had an intestinal parasite  ###  told us that is what most people that come in have  ###  if this is the case why does not the resort have medication on the premise totreat this condition  ###  clarification of this was never given because we never got the results of the test  ###  that and no one could translate for us  ###  we were brought upstairs where i was given antibiotics via the iv and something else that knockedme out  ###  nurses came in and out but no one ever asked if she was feeling better and we never saw the doctor again  ###  when my husband asked if i could leave soon they called me animpatient caucasian yet needed to get another patient to translate  ###  initially we were told that the transportation back to the resort is provided by the excellence  ###  this is not thecase  ###  around 7pm a nurse came in and handed us a bag of three differentdrugs and finally took the iv out  ###  when we got outside the hospital i felt faint and nauseous and had to sit down on the curb  ###  ( our cab left )  ###  we went back inside the hospital  ###  but we left once i got her color back  ###  when we got back homemy arm was infected from the iv  ###  prieto tours - my husband went to them to explain to them why we did not show up for the catamaran trip  ###  he was told to show them proof  ###  could not he just call the concierge or the on resort doctor  ###  i went up to my room and brought down the only paper we received from the hospital  ###  eventually they agreed togive me my money back but we lost more time  ###  conclusion -

80	not excellence my family went from dec  ###  31- jan 4  ###  we chose the option to be executive excellence club members  ###  it is not worth it  ###  i saw no difference in treatment for us compared to the other visitors  ###  there were pros and cons  ###  i will be very blunt in my review  ###  i 'll try to break this down as simply as possible  ###  service : *  ###  when you walk into the resort you will be greeted with a phrase hola welcome home , which i found cute  ###  service people smile a lot and are nice  ###  everyone seems like they want to accommodate your needs  ###  however , most of the time they will say ok and then disappear  ###  it will take quite some time to get what you 've asked for  ###  i was disappointed with their service  ###  seems like they need better management  ###  rooms : * the rooms are exactly as pictured on their site  ###  every room is the same  ###  turn down service once a day , twice if you 're lucky  ###  they give you shampoo , conditioner toothbrush , q - tip , soap , shower cap , comb , sewing kit , iron board , iron , hair dryer , slippers , bath robes , wooden hangers , a small safe , etc  ###  the rooms are old fashioned , 'charming ' would be the word  ###  you get tbs , tnt and such  ###  if you 're bringing kids , beware  ###  there is a xxx channel on the tv  ###  our bed was not too sanitary  ###  there were old ( unwashable ) stains on the sheets , they should throw those away instead of reusing them  ###  we found a lizard , fleas , beetles , and ants in our room  ###  the room does has a funky smell to it  ###  bring air freshener if you can  ###  room service is good , actually faster than eating at their restaurants  ###  meals : * similar to other reviewers , for new years dinner we waited 3  ###  5 hours for dinner  ###  our dinner was quicker than the others because we were too exhausted to stay for dessert  ###  they ruined our new year 's eve mood , and from what i saw at the other tables  ###  a lot of people 's new years eve mood was dampened that night  ###  every night was a challenge for dinner  ###  their no reservations needed policy makes it harder for you to eat dinner  ###  because there is no reservation , people wait in a line to eat  ###  so you do not know how long it will take for you to be seated  ###  once you are seated , your orders will taken about 20-30 minutes after you 've been seated  ###  service at restaurants are tremendously slow  ###  even the buffet lunch , there were so many empty tables but it took us 15 minutes to get seated  ###  * excellence claims they have 7 restaurants but what they failed to mention was that not all 7 open everyday  ###  the french restaurant chez isabelle never opened while we were there  ###  and some of other restaurants take turns using one room on different nights  ###  if you 're going to eat at the restaurants that are outside : the lobster house or the grill make sure you 've sprayed yourself with mosquito repellent  ###  my family was eaten alive from eating at the lobster house  ###  definitely bring itch cream , mosquito bites at night are inevitable there  ###  * best meal and service was the dinner at the beach  ###  it is extra $ but was worth the experience  ###  it was the highlight of our stay there  ###  again , spray mosquito repellent  ###  overall , food was not great but edible  ###  you can see that the chefs are trying but everything was way too salty  ###  * free drinks 24/7 is the best part of the resort  ###  it 's free  ###  you 'll never drink so much fruity drinks in your life  ###  i do not drink alcohol , but still had bountiful virgin - versions to enjoy  ###  pool* the best pool i 've seen in a long time  ###  it 's clean , not too crowded because it 's so long  ###  they have huts , tents , pool bar , chairs , and an on - site waiter to bring your drinks  ###  the view from the pool is beautiful  ###  you can see the ocean not too far from the pool  ###  pool is a plus here  ###  beach* did you know that the beach is not included  ###  the sign on the beach says you have to be an excellence club member to go to the beach  ###  but do not fret  ###  nobody really checked to see if the beach go - ers were members or not  ###  beach is beautiful  ###  like a postcard  ###  do take at least 2 days to stay at the beach  ###  it 's very stunning and relaxing  ###  activities at hotel* they have program schedules everyday  ###  but most of them are not successful  ###  we waited for beach volleyball but since there were not enough people , it never happened  ###  tennis courts are loose gravel , you have to sign in and save a time frame if you want to play  ###  the site says you are given free half - hour horseback riding and such  ###  but trust me , they wo not call you up and make sure you do it  ###  it seemed like they 'd rather you forget about it  ###  because not enough horses  ###

be able to get to toronto on time  ###  we arrived at 11:10 for our 11:45 flight , and frightfully added a $160 parking fee onto our trip  ###  luckily for us , our toronto flight was delayed , and we ended up at the montreal airport at 2 am  ###  the punta cana airport is delightful  ###  with the thatched roof , the local musicians playing as you enter , the winsome locals costumed for your ( $8) photo opportunity , it?? all very fun  ###  air canada gave us a card that covered our $10 entrance fee to the country  ###  the last time we were in punta cana , we had a $25 departure tax , so we were prepared for that as we left , but it was never charged  ###  air canada must have swung some sweet deal  ###  or they saw us coming with our over - sized , thermal ( hello  ###  travel mugs and figured us loud , soon - to - be - drunken neanderthals weren?? worth the bother  ###  with polite direction from an air canada rep , we made our way to our quickly departing coach bus , where wendel , a tri - lingual ( french , english and spanish ) customer service representative from the resort distributed our bracelets , room keys , and maps on the bus  ###  as soon as we arrived at the resort , i made a quick right into the guest services room to book our a la cartes , while my husband was immediately whisked with our bags to our rooms  ###  i spoke with jean , and immediately booked the garden grill and mikado , the two we had decided on previously  ###  after i expressed some ( charming ) indecision between the dominican and the brazilian , jean offered to seat us for both  ###  we also had friends that greased the guest services people with a 20 for an extra dinner , and ones that got an extra one by showing up a little early to one of the a la cartes  ###  our room (17105) was on the ground floor of the 3rd building away from the lobby , and one building away from the centre pool?? great location , we decided , for going to dinner in high heels , stumbling home after karaoke , running for more sunblock from the pool , and a nice walk to beach to work off some of  ###  the room was cool , and not musty at all  ###  we especially loved the marble bathroom with jacuzzi tub ( which i tried , and was very relaxing )  ###  a few ( completely minor ) annoyances : the tv has no channel listing , and no numbers to press on the remote to go to a specific channel  ###  there is no clock or iron in the room ( although we borrowed one from guest services that came immediately , and was followed up by 2 phone calls to be sure that we had it and enjoyed it  ###  first impression of the main buffet : yum  ###  no , sorry that was my second impression  ###  my first impression was : why does the lobby smell like a bathroom  ###  even the ( very well - appointed ) lobby bathroom doesn?? smell like a bathroom  ###  while waiting in the lobby , i heard a little kid ask his mom why the lobby of the buffet smelled so bad  ###  mom : that?? just the smell of every food in the buffet blending together  ###  because i??e never walked into the kitchen while my husband?? making a stir - fry and thought , ??ooh , garbage water and sewage  ###  br/>i enjoyed the buffet : i really liked the stewed meat ( very tender??he average piece of beef in dr is tough??robably because it?? not kept in a tiny pen like in na??ut not if it?? been stewed ) , rice and beans??uthentic dominican food  ###  i had a hot dog , which was also perfectly good  ###  i thought the service in the main buffet was consistent  ###  all servers made an attempt to speak the language of their guests ( whether it been english , french or german ) , and appreciated your massacring of their romantic language  ###  i never waited for agua or caf? con leche , which i appreciated  ###  we explored the resort , and quickly found a spot under a palapa at the pool ( at 3 pm )  ###  the pool bar service was quick , although we found the bartender fernando a lot friendlier and faster than feliciano  ###  while they don?? have strawberry daquiris ( my favourite ) , they had 6 different kinds of slushie mixes : pina colada , lemon , coco loco ( straight coconut ) , a chocolateish one , blue hawaii ( coconut and blue curacao ) and sometimes an orangey one as well  ###  the walk to the beach is not bad at all  ###  yes , the resort is big , but we often beat the tram walking down to the beach  ###  from the lobby , it is about 8-10 minutes at a brisk pace , but there are plenty of stops along the way if you want to jump on a tram part - way  ###  the pool right by the beach is very big ( although not as expansive as other resorts i??e seen ) , and seemed to be really busy , especially with kids  ###  the other pools were not available to us , and didn?? seem to be busy at all  ###  the beach is gorgeous  ###  the sand is not hot , and is very light and soft  ###  the water is a beautiful green  ###  we absolutely loved the waves , and got some ??ody boards?  ###  from the sports centre ( located at the right end of the beach if you??e facing the water )  ###  you can borrow them for an hour with a 20 dollar deposit ( each )  ###  we found that you could ??ide the waves?  ###  timing a jump right just as well  ###  the water has no rocks at all along the shore , but we found when the water was calm , there was more ??tuff?  ###  and other natural debris ) swirling around your legs  ###  we got up at 7:30 everyday to get a good spot on the beach : under a palapa , with a table and chairs , right in front of the bar  ###  our friends got up at 9:30, and had no problem finding chairs in the sun  ###  the first night we went to the garden grille  ###  the service was wonderful : empty glasses , plates and warm towels were swept away by the many servers immediately after use  ###  the caesar salad bar was a bit of a disappointment : iceberg lettuce , and a strange - tasting dressing  ###  i actually found that most salad dressings throughout the resort had a bitter taste to me : almost like a sour vinegar  ###  my husband had the steak ( cooked medium rare ) and also the shrimp brioche , and i had the beef ribs , both were ??ood?  ###  served with crispy onions and a plantain wrap and potato  ###  for dessert , i had a pineapple crisp with ice cream that was super , super sweet  ###  the pineapple there is so sweet naturally that glazing it makes it almost inedible  ###  the restaurant had very nice ambiance and friendly service  ###  the dominican restaurant was a little tough to find : it?? in the premiere section , past the lobby ( toward the road ) on the ??avaro side?  ###  of the resort ( the left if you??e facing the water )  ###  the restaurant is open air , and they served a nice welcome drink  ###  this restaurant also had a small buffet for appetizers , and i enjoyed the dominican soup  ###  they serve plaintain and sweet potato chips and shrimp appetizer which was good  ###  i had the bass with coconut sauce ( nice ) , and my husband had lobster ( half ) with creole sauce that he said was cooked well  ###  the brazilian restaurant is in the open air restaurant on the beach that is the snack bar during the day  ###  a buffet is offered for appetizers as usual , then the waiters circulate the restaurant with skewered pieces of meat on 3- foot - long metal stakes  ###  
80	great vacation with the kids  ###  i am back from a relaxing vacation ( yes  ###  with the kids - 4 yrs and 8 mos ) at gran bahia principe  ###  i finally settled on the bahia after much online research  ###  it was highly rated on trip advisor and we wanted to stay in a resort chain with a good reputation so we would have a worry free vacation  ###  i will give my review and a few tips we found helpful for travelling with our children  ###  we stayed on the bavaro side of the hotel and requested a room closest to the buffet  ###  this is a huge resort and it was so handy staying close to the lobby , buffet and entertainment areas  ###  the beach is furthest away with all the rooms situated between the lobby and the beach  ###  we stayed in building 38 which was very handy to the lobby  ###  flightthe skyservice flight to punta cana was excellent , left on time , staff were great and a breakfast sandwich was offered  ###  the return flight smooth with a sandwich offered for lunch  ###  the staff were very helpful  ###  take some special treats and a couple new toys and i found cheerios were a gret diversion for a baby  ###  there is a changetable located in the bathrooms  ###  the punta cana airport has a number of little shops for browsing and snacks  ###  upon arrival they take your photo which you then pick up on your return to the airport  ###  there are some sections which are air conditioned and some are not  ###  wear your shorts and pack your pants to change into on the plane or at home because the airport is so hot in some sections and waiting in line to check in can be very frustrating especially with children  ###  check inyou are transported by a large coach to the hotel  ###  i was worried aboout taking car seats vs not and found that it was not really necessary and the ride was smooth and the road was not busy so i found it to be quite safe  ###  you are given an envelope with your room number while on the bus which was convenient  ###  we had our wrist bands and were ready to enjoy the resort as soon as we got there  ###  also in your envelope is a pass port guide to the hotel and towel cards  ###  check in is at 3pm but we found that when we asked if our room might be ready early as we wanted the put our daughter down for a nap that we could get in the room by 2pm  ###  also at check - in ask for your safe to be set up if you will require it ( the cost is $4 a day )  ###  it gave us peace of mind leaving any valuables in the room  ###  roomsthe rooms are set up in 3 level buildings  ###  if you have kids , request a ground level room  ###  it 's so much easier  ###  the rooms are apparently king bed or 2 doubles  ###  i requested a king but got two doubles - oh well , it ended up being fine  ###  there is also a large wide sofa in the room which would work well for a child 's bed  ###  rooms are equipped with a tv with a fair number of channels ( mostly spanish but a few english as well ) including nickelodeon  ###  there is a minibar fridge which we used to store bottles of baby food  ###  it is stocked daily so you never run out of pop , beer or water  ###  the bottled water is excellent for making bottles or taking to the beach as you should not be drinking the tap water in dr  ###  we were given a playpen , although over the phone i was told it would be a crib and not a playpen when i asked specifically  ###  nonetheless is was in good condition and suited our needs  ###  a la carte restaurantsas has been mentioned , on a week 's vacation , you can book 3 a la carte dinners  ###  i would do so early ( possibly even as soon as you arrive and are waiting for your room ) as we found most were fully booked until at least 5 days into our trip  ###  there are 6 options and 1 additional new bbq restaurant a la cartes  ###  we had the japenese ( excellent and our son watched his dvd player at the table while we ate ) , gourmet ( we found the service to be not so great with the expection of julianna who was lovely , they have a kids menu )  ###  las olas was the new bbq restaurant we were offered because the others were full  ###  we found out is is really the beach buffet so we were not too excited about that as it was not a true a la carte  ###  i have heard the garden grill ( steakhouse ) is excellent and there is also an italian , seafood and mexican restaurants on the bavaro side  ###  the bavaro guests are able to dine in the a la cartes on the bavaro side and not on the punta cana side and vice versa  ###  they also have seperate buffets  ###  buffetthe buffet was very good here  ###  you can eat at the main buffet restaurant , the seafood or mexican restaurant ( also buffets open at breakfast and lunch )  ###  there is so much variety and most is very tasty  ###  it is open a little late for dinner when you have kids (7-10pm ) but we found that we all just adjusted our schedules slightly and they were fine  ###  we would often feed my daughter (8 mos ) a jar of food in the room beforehand and then give her some cheerios to snack on while we ate  ###  for breakfast , the is breads , bagels , cereals , eggs , pancakes , french toast , fresh fruits , juices , smoothies , omelets and eggs to order , pastries , jams and a variety of other dishes  ###  for lunch , there are salads , breads for sandwiches , hot dogs , burgers , pizza , pasta , soups , and various dishes of the day  ###  the dinners are in a different theme each night ( spanish , american , italian , mexican , dominican , asian and a gala dinner on saturday )  ###  we loved the mexican and dominican nights - delicious  ###  the details are amazing including towers of desserts , ice sculptures , carved melons , and sugar and bread sculptures which decorate the buffet area  ###  there was always 4-5 selections each night specifically for kids  ###  often , it was fried foods but it was nice that they thought of this  ###  my son loved the pizza , pasta , fresh fruits , eggs , juices and we would often make him sandwiches for lunch  ###  the staff were sometimes friendly , sometimes cool but were always at your service and plates and dishes were always cleared right away  ###  it might be helpful to learn a few key phrases in spanish - the staff really appreciated it and your kids will learn some works in a new language  ###  beachwe did not spend alot of time here with the kids  ###  my son was leary of the ocean waves and it was often rough and babies and sand are not the best mix  ###  if you do go , take along a few towels to make a beach blanket  ###  there is plenty of shade and tons of beach chairs  ###  there is a trolley that runs from the lobby to the beach every few minutes  ###  you never have to wait long  ###  there is a ship wreck right in front of the resort in the ocean apparently a wreck from the 70s we were told  ###  interesting to see  ###  poolsgorgeous and warm  ###  there are 2 pools - one located at the beach ( the large main pool ) and a smaller central pool located halfway along the little road that runs the length of the resort  ###  there is a 3rd diamond club pool but unless you 've upgraded you cannot swim here  ###  both pools have seperate kiddie areas , gradual entries and pool bars  ###  the pool bars had a variety of refreshments for kids like juices and slushy drinks  ###  we spent almost all day every day at the pool  ###  there are shady areas in the pool and my we always dressed my son in his suit , a t - shirt and hat to keep him out of the sun as much as we could because he was in the pool most of the day  ###  there are lots of chairs ( provided you arrive before 10ish ) and shade covers  ###  i found i did not need a playpen at the pool , because my daughter either was in the pool or sat with us on the beach chair sleeping or playing  ###  
80	poor , poor , poor  ###  me and my wife decided to take a caribbean break this november , we did not go for a cheap holiday , or to just simply get away from the cold weather in england  ###  i had heard that the resort was very nice , and the fact that they append their hotel resort with premium made me feel that i was in for a great week  ###  well nothing could be further from the truth  ###  the holiday got off to a bad start as we arrived in dom rep  ###  once we had shooed away the case handlers who were instantly after my money/dollars - we were greeted with a 90 deep queue of people finding out where the transport was  ###  there was no rep from thomsons there , just a big queue - after 9 hours on a plane , its the last thing you want  ###  minutes later we were told our transport bus  ###  ok , we got on and was instantly sold the dom rep slogan - ( still no sign of the thomsons rep ) - no problem  ###  hmm , so its the caribbean , everything is easy and no rush  ###  i took that as charm , but as i later found out its an excuse for laziness , i think we have a similar slogan back in the uk , its called ca not be arsed  ###  we get to out resort and my case is not on the bus  ###  the idiots had just took off my case at the previous hotel and i had to go on my own with the transport man and his driver to get my case  ###  by this point i was a little fed up , especially after i had been guilt tripped into tipping the driver for basically doing his job  ###  seriously though the guy was telling us what a good tip was , suffice to say i gave less then then i was told , because i thought it was very cheeky  ###  wish i gave nothing now because i was not happy with the service  ###  ok , we arrive at the checkout , 2 or 3 receptionists all on the phone , this was to become a bit of a trend - i actually think its because they had not a clue and were asking superior members of staff  ###  please note i say superior in the loosest way possible  ###  ok , after 15 minutes of waiting and watching some clown type in numbers on a keyboard , ring people up , print something out , we eventually got our room card and towel form  ###  we were also informed at this point that the a - la - carte restaurants are to be booked between 9 and 4 in the morning  ###  ok , that 's fine  ###  we got sorted , and went to the bar for a pre - meal drink  ###  it was fine , nice daquiri - but i believe we were just fortunate  ###  i also noticed at this point the fairly sparse looking bar with no real options to choose from  ###  they had plenty of substitute bottles , like rum that 's not bacardi , or vodka that 's not absolute , etc  ###  but they were all in speedracks hidden out of view  ###  as we had no a - la - carte booked we moved into the buffet , and again i noticed lack of options  ###  not much choice , and what was on offer was greasy and fatty  ###  however i was not that disappointed because i expected it , and i was also intending to eat a - la - carte all week  ###  we also noticed the room was a little below par , door rattled , tv was poor and had intermittent signal problems  ###  that is when we finally got to the damn room - the maze that is the barcelo punta cana rivals the labyrinth that jack faced in the shining  ###  oh there were signs pointing in directions that were not possible to follow  ###  next morning we come down for the meeting with the rep , ( finally we meet someone from thomson 's ) - we were informed that we should have received our pre - invitations for the a - la - carte all week  ###  it appears that we were the only one 's with no pre - invites  ###  so that also annoyed me and smacked a bit of incompetence from a hotel reception that according to wellington the general manager and some american guy peddling a jeep safari thing , had its emphasis on p - r - e - m - i - u - m  ###  hmm , do the best hotels blow their trumpet in such a way  ###  i doubt it  ###  ok , we get to to the reception to find out why we have no invitations , and snail - girl proceeded to print out my invitations  ###  it was like pulling teeth  ###  i got no apology , no explanation , just the printed invites , and also the information that 2 of the days were left open and we had to book for those days separately  ###  anyway , the sun was shining , the pool was very nice , and the wife was happy  ###  however the pool bar was where we discovered the first real element of bar oddity  ###  we swam up and asked for a pina colada and a strawberry daquiri  ###  we were told there was no rum for ten minutes , but we were also asked if we wanted alcohol in the pina colada  ###  now i 'm sure it has rum in it , so i was confused  ###  i was also confused that the bar woman served three americans strawberry daquiri 's almost immediately after telling us there was no rum  ###  later that day we got our first taste of the rain , it did not spoil the day because it was gone in a flash  ###  but we had one more day of nice weather and then it was mostly rain for the rest of the week  ###  ok there is nothing that can be done with the weather , but what it did do is force us to look more closely at the faults of the hotel  ###  the lack of any kind of entertainment within the hotel ( three pool tables and a crap argos style dart board does not count ) - no tv reception during rain , untrained staff and lack of real character in the hotel really started to hammer home the failures that this place has  ###  ceilings were caving in by the bar , buckets were about to catch drips  ###  it really was a depressing sight  ###  now i have spent two weeks in riu yucatan in mexico , so i have pretty high standards  ###  so when i came across this hotel in dom rep , you can imagine my disappointment  ###  it was not even average , it was poor  ###  breakfast is also something that is not without its faults  ###  half the restaurant was open due to the season , but i expected there to be coffee cups on every table , and napkins on every table  ###  it made the choosing of a table that little bit more tedious  ###  one time we just had to sit down , flag down a waiter/waitress - ask them for a cup , wait 5 or 10 minutes , by which time breakfast was more than half way through , and then eventually got served  ###  but more often than not i just did not bother  ###  did not want to intrude on the no problem attitude  ###  this brings me back around to the lack of training or understanding of the language/accent  ###  i do speak a little spanish , enough to order drinks  ###  but more often i found myself speaking in two languages , and almost pointing to the drinks menu what i wanted  ###  for a resort that has an incredible amount of american tourists , i would have thought some kind of knowledge in english would have been a pre - requisite  ###  now it was not all doom and gloom , there were some bright spots  ###  but its a shame they were dragged down by the increasing amount of negative points  ###  those at that point were the in - room coffee machine not working , the tv remote control not working , or the replacement one we got also failing to work  ###  a leaking roof , rattling double - glazing doors - which just showed as shoddy workmanship  ###  wonky pictures , sockets fitted by a blind man , doors not fitting door frames neatly  ###  the ice machine outside also failing to work  ###  a couple told us we should complain and get an upgrade , but apparently the upgrades were just as shoddy  ###  and i really did not want to spend more time watching an untrained receptionist constantly on the phone for what remained of my holiday  ###  now the bright spots  ###  the pool is nice , the beach also very nice  ###  two a - la - carte restaurants - the italian roma and the japanese tokio  ###  they were stunning , especially the roma  ###  the french one let itself down by not bringing what we ordered  ###  we asked for a dish without certain vegetables and to be replaced with vegetables off another dish  ###  we were told it was no problem  ###  
80	stress free vacation we stayed at excellence may28th till june 3rd  ###  being self employed its hard getting away from more then a long 3 or 4 day weekend  ###  so being able to spend 6 nights at epc was a nice treat  ###  first thing i wanna say which has no barring on epc itself is if you can book your flight and not have to use miami as a stop do it  ###  it is the worst airport i have ever been in  ###  it was not bad on the way to punta cana but customs was a mad house  ###  there was so much confusion on where to go and how to get there and with it being a major international airport the customs lines are long  ###  airport was beautiful never been to a port where its all open air and thatched roofs  ###  we were in and out of the airport in 30 minutes tops  ###  we booked out transfer with mikes taxi 's  ###  ibk they were right there as you walk out of the airport  ###  the driver was nice he spoke little english and we spoke little spanish so we did not communicate with each other very well  ###  lol the ride was fine was not horrible but i can see where some people complain about it being rough or dangerous at times  ###  its long if you get caught behind some of the large construction trucks if you get lucky and have a semi clear ride it could be under an hour if not expect 75 minutes or so  ###  pulling up to the lobby is much like any other resort you get the customary champagne and wet towel  ###  we were escorted to the excellence club for check in by my man antonio who we would see all week  ###  he remember our names all week and is an asset to this resort  ###  which may seem strange since he was a bellboy but he really has great customer service skills  ###  we meet roberto he runs the excellence club and is the best  ###  was willing to do anything he could to make sure we had the best time while we were there  ###  throughout the week as we walked by the ??lub?  ###  we would get a wave or an hola or asked if we needed anything to make our stay even better  ###  took a few minutes for check in and chatted for a few then they took us to our room  ###  we stayed in swim up room 10004  ###  it was nice it was clean and there was a flat screen tv  ###  all a man needs right  ###  we had a nice bar filled with different hard liquors that we actually never used  ###  only thing we did was asked for a bottle of wine each day and they brought it by in the afternoon each day  ###  they had 3 choices of beer presidante bohemia and bud  ###  ended up changing the bud for number 1, which is a dominican beer , which ended up being our favorite  ###  they also had a few snacks including kit kats oreo 's and crackers  ###  which we found came in handy each day  ###  the room was one of the few that didn?? have lounge chairs right in front of the room or a hammock right outside your door  ###  neither was a big deal since we asked for a room that was closed to the water  ###  we did have 2 chairs and a table outside our door though  ###  drinks were good i will say i hear a lot of people complain about the drinks not being strong and this has a lot to do with the type of drink you order  ###  if you are ordering sammy sosa?? , daiquiris margarita?? etc this will more then likely be the case because they are premixed and in a machine just waiting to be poured out  ###  you can go anywhere and the drink will be weak from these machines  ###  all you need to do is ask for a little extra run or tequila when you order it and they will put it in  ###  any of the other drinks that they pour and aren?? pre made you wont have a problem with  ###  food was good we ate at every restaurant except for barcelona the mediterranean  ###  i was a little worried about the lobster since i have read in numerous reviews was not good  ###  it was my favorite meal  ###  i got the cajun spiced grilled lobster and it was delicious  ###  the grill was pretty good as well  ###  and then portions at the grill were large  ###  actually too larger for us we had a ton of food we didn?? even finish  ###  the beef was a little overcooked then what i asked for but it was still easily cut with a butter knife so it wasn?? dry at all just not quite how i asked for it  ###  not a biggie  ###  spice was a good meal also it?? the asian restaurant and the sushi was pretty good as was the duck i got  ###  after all the raving about the french restaurant here on t/a and from talking to other guests at the resort we were really looking forward to our meal and ended up disappointed  ###  not because it was bad , it was good just not great  ###  the service was ??xcellent?  ###  here the best we had all week for dinner  ###  i think it had to do with higher expectations  ###  the meal was good nothing blew us away  ###  then toscana was the italian restaurant its lacking in atmosphere but this is just due to it being a multi purpose restaurant  ###  its connected to barcelona and kinda has a school cafeteria feel to it  ###  this is because it also serves the buffet for breakfast and lunch  ###  food was good here though  ###  for lunch our favorite place was the grill  ###  it has a couple of lighter options for lunch when its hot and you don?? what heavy foods like burgers etc  ###  and the big reason we went there a lot was because of the service we got from ricky  ###  he was great , always attentive and would chat with those that were interested in having a conversation and would leave you alone if you were having a private conversation with each other  ###  never an empty glass i normally had wine with lunch and i walked out each afternoon a little buzzed because he always had my glass filled  ###  i actually had to ask him to slow down  ###  loli will say we had no wait times at any meal we showed up to meals between 6:45 and 7:30 each evening and the restaurants were near empty so it looks like most people eat late  ###  we were actually disappointed a little since we like to have a few drinks and chat before dinner  ###  the meals also only took 30 minutes tops which seemed strange to us if they are trying to have upscale meals  ###  we were also a little disappointed with this since we got all dressed up for a meal and it was so short  ###  i am sure most will like this but we were never in a hurry so this wasn?? our preference  ###  beach and pools were nice  ###  the beach was clean no trash or rocks and we had plenty of room to pick a chair all day long  ###  the water was black or red flagged each day but it didn?? have any problems out in the water you can get out there chest high without being worried about the rip current  ###  any deeper and you need to use caution  ###  pool was good we woke up the first morning early fully expecting the chair wars to begin  ###  so i got up at 6:30 looked out our sliding glass door and not a person in site  ###  took a shower etc watched some tv looked out again around 7:45 right before we went to breakfast and there were only 2 spots taken so we went and saved a spot thinking we would be outta luck if we waited till after breakfast  ###  we ate and went back to the room to change headed out to the pool around 9:30 and there were atleast half of the lounges still open but most of the shaded lounges were taken by this time  ###  this was how it was everyday of our stay  ###

really interesting  ###  you know for sure you are on vacation ?  ###  no mcdonald?? , home depots and any of the other crap we have lining our highways  ###  it?? a half paved road and at times you feel you may crash into oncoming traffic or a guy on a donkey  ###  the resort grounds are lovely  ###  there are animals ?? fed a duck and named him afflack  ###  there are parrots ( lovers ) and flamingoes and random chickens , rabbits very cute  ###  this is mostly by the entrance way the pool area doesn?? have animals but the water is deeeelish not too cold not too warm  ###  the best pool is over by rooms in the 2?? and 3??  ###  it has a waterfall and it?? quiet and the bar service there ( although not swim up ) is good  ###  the food : breakfast is good  ###  you have a lot of selection and they make fresh omlettes right there  ###  the bacon is strange so opt instead for the hash brows ( so good ) and the scrambled eggs , fresh fruit , pancakes , crepes , french toast and 100 other things to choose from  ###  the downside ?  ###  the juices weren?? that cold and they all have pulp so i stuck to champagne with pineapple juice  ###  lunch : service at the pool is limited  ###  they cook on the beach but it?? not good at all ?  ###  dry chicken , overcooked burgers , don?? bother with any of the food on the beach  ###  it?? not easy to eat poolside  ###  you can tell they encourage people to dine in the two main places for lunch  ###  the grill and la toscana  ###  la toscana has deeelish pizzas which you can take to go ??lthough they don?? encourage this  ###  la toscana is buffet and the grille is sit down lunch  ###  both good but if you want to get back to the pool or beach in under an hour leat at la toscana  ###  the grille is more of a sit down hang out enjoy lunch type of lunch  ###  dinner : the grille was the favorite  ###  but general tip if you are ordering steak and expect it to be prepared correctly you must ask for it ??edium rare con sangre ( with blood )  ###  i?? puerto rican so i know that hispanics tend to overcook their beef  ###  so when ordering a steak con sangre ??hat will get you the cooked but pink and juicy on the inside  ###  the grille is open air and deeeelish at night  ###  i advise to get to dinner by 8:00 ?  ###  8:30 at the latest to avoid crowds and crappy service  ###  toscana : it?? italian  ###  if you are used to nyc italian you??l be fine but not at all impressed  ###  if italian to you means olive garden , you??l love it  ###  the little disc bread they give is amamzing  ###  better if they topped it with garlic and olive oil  ###  chez isabelle : lovely d?cor , food was decent  ###  again not blowing me away but an enjoyable meal  ###  i had the chicken  ###  husband had the chateau briand and they overcooked it  ###  we told the couple seated next to us to make sure they order it ??on sangre , ?  ###  later saw them at the club and he said it was great  ###  the beach : ahhhhh what a fantastic relaxing breeeeze  ###  the sun in july isn?? as strong as the sun in mexico but it will get you toasty  ###

80	not what we expected , but not bad either we just returned from a trip to punta cana , at the melia caribe where we spent 7 nights with our three teenage children april 4 through the 11th  ###  after looking at several reviews on trip advisor , we booked this trip in july of 2007  ###  overall , our trip was good  ###  there were many positive aspects along with our trip along with some disappointments mostly pertaining to the poor service at the resort  ###  we arrived late in the afternoon due to a 3 hour flight delay on our flight out of atlanta to punta cana due to equipment issues with the plane  ###  we arrived at the melia around 5pm  ###  to our surprise , there were not many people checking in at that time , but front desk service was extremely slow  ###  we did not opt for royal service , but the man who checked us in sent us over to vip to check - in  ###  when we arrived at the vip lounge check - in desk , there was a great deal of confusion and we were sent back over to the regular check - in counter  ###  we had requested a king room for ourselves and also a room with two double beds for the 3 teens  ###  when the reservation was booked back in july , we had made this request and also requested the rooms were in the same building  ###  this request had been guaranteed since the reservation was made eight months prior to traveling  ###  they pulled the reservation and our room was in building 9 and the teens were located in building 12  ###  the response was that that was the best they could do  ###  i told them we wouldn?? accept that room placement  ###  so they started working on trying to find two rooms in the same building  ###  after approximately 45 minutes they found two rooms in building 9?  ###  however , when we went to those rooms , we found they both had king beds which would not work  ###  so??nother 15 minute trip back to the front desk and another hour to get us two rooms in the same building  ###  one with a king and one with two double beds  ###  when we got the keys , i went to the bell cap and clearly marked on each bag?? airline tag where each bag was to go  ###  we went to the rooms to freshen up and make a run at the buffets  ###  after dinner , i checked with the bellman to see if the bags were delivered to the room and he couldn?? tell me  ###  finally after about a half hour , he confirmed the bags were delivered  ###  as for the resort , the grounds were very immaculate and well - kept  ###  there was an abundance of trees , exotic foliage , flowers , birds and other wildlife  ###  it was most likely the most beautiful resort we ever visited  ###  the property itself , including the lobby and rooms were well kept and very clean  ###  the lobby and dining areas were beautiful and kept very clean  ###  the rooms were a little dated , but overall were clean and very well kept with a few exceptions  ###  the safe in the teen?? room did not work and it took three days to get it fixed  ###  there were two days where we had to call service because the shower in their bath did not work  ###  the last few days , condensation from the vent in their room dripped quite a bit  ###  it was more of an issue with the air conditioning running all of the time due to the heat and was probably working harder than usual  ###  housekeeping could have been a little more consistent in the sense there were a couple of days where we had to call for towels or water and pop for the mini fridges  ###  finally , we found the closet in each building where the pop and water were stored and filled the mini fridges ourselves  ###  the dining and food was quite good for an all inclusive  ###  even the three buffets that we ate at were good and had a lot of variety and daily changes to the offerings which is not the norm for buffets at an all - inclusive  ###  wait staff at the buffets was not very good and usually you had to either wait ten minutes for drinks or request them  ###  our experience at the ala cartes was very good  ###  we dined at the japanese , dominican , mexican , thai / asian , american grille the seafood and the french restaurants and all were very good to excellent  ###  the food was very flavorful and there was a nice variety of choices on all of the menus  ###  our three favorites were the japanese , seafood and the thai restaurants  ###  the japanese restaurant was quite entertaining as well , and the service outstanding  ###  as for reservations for the al cartes , be prepared to dial repeatedly beginning at 9 am to get through and then find that most of the prime time slots are already gone especially with the popular restaurants such as the japanese  ###  you can make reservations for the current evening that morning and also for the next evening , so we usually lined up a couple of evenings at a time  ###  you can call after 1:30 pm each day and check on cancellations and that helped us on a couple of days  ###  there is an abundance of bars on the property and the bar and wait staff at all bars were friendly and worked hard to keep you happy  ###  drinks were not great , but not entirely bad either  ###  the beer on tap was presidente from the dominican republic which was good  ###  the frozen drinks were dispensed from a frozen drink machine in a cup on top of rum , tequila , or other alcohol  ###  often , they were very runny , especially late in the day after the heat took its toll on the machines  ###  but overall the drinks were good and they were always in abundance  ###  our only disappointment regarding the bars and drinks was that there was no bar at the beach  ###  if you were at the beach and wanted to drink , you had to walk to one of the pools which was a 5 minute walk  ###  the pools were very spacious in size and kept very clean  ###  the two pools closest to the beach had a lot of chairs available as well as a swim up bar at each  ###  the pool on the tropical side tended to have a lot of young children there because of the close proximity to the flintstones part of the resort  ###  the tropical side had more adults there  ###  there was a lack of organized activity at the pools for teens and adults such as water volleyball , etc  ###  so that was somewhat disappointing  ###  the beach was out of this world  ###  it was very large with trees and beautiful white sand  ###  there were an abundance of lounge chairs on the beach along with a couple of beach volleyball and bocce courts  ###  stay away from the vendors on the beach as there are better buys on the same items at the mall in front of the resort or at the local market  ###  scuba caribe has a location on the beach at the resort and can offer some options that the tour operators in the resort lobby do not , such as a two hour scuba trip to the reef , and these trips are less expensive than booking through the guys in the lobby  ###  there was nightly entertainment each night including a show each night at the caribe  ###  there was also live music and/or karaoke each evening  ###  it was pretty difficult to be bored at this resort as there were many options to choose from  ###  the golf at el cocotal is very nice and scenic  ###  there are 27 holes that are very challenging and many of the holes have a lot of sand on them  ###  the golf is free with the package except for the cart which is $35 per person  ###  there is regular transportation to the course and back to the resort  ###  service at the course , however , is lacking and confusion reigns rampant  ###  tee time spacings were often too close and the course usually backed up by the time you started the back nine  ###  a round of 5 ? to 6 hours is not uncommon on this course even with a 27 hole layout  ###  finally , stay away from the timeshare pimps in the lobby and at the entrance to the buffets by the pools  ###  they press hard to get you to go to the 90 minute presentation  ###  we had no intentions of going through a presentation , but one of the guys said , just get up after 20 minutes and they??l still give you the $70 gift certificate?  ###  overall , our trip experience was good , but not great or what we had expected  ###  
80	a wonderful resort  ###  my husband and i just returned from a one week stay at excellence  ###  this was by far the best vacation overall we 've had ( including several carribean islands and europe )  ###  my review will be quite lengthy i 'm sure  ###  but there really is so much one can say about this place  ###  i had read some horror stories from others in regards to the transfer from the airport to hotel  ###  we decided to book our transportation through excellence rather than deal with a large bus that made stops at other resorts  ###  leticia from concierge arranged this for us via email  ###  we landed at the airport ( which is really very pretty  ###  open style w/ thatched roofs ) without any problems  ###  we were greeted by a very pleasant man vertillio who was waiting for us outside of baggage claim  ###  he immediately took our luggage and walked us over to a new land cruiser equipped with soft leather seats  ###  he had cold towels waiting for us and 2 excellence bottled waters  ###  it was dark when we landed  ###  but the ride to our resort was surprisingly smooth  ###  we had great conversation with vertillio  ###  ( i speak some span  ###  he even stopped at a local drinking hole for us and we got a couple of ice cold presidente 's for the road  ###  total cost was $60 for transfer which i would highly recommend and ask for him when booking  ###  he was not available for our trip back so we had to take a cab last minute  ###  not nearly as relaxing  ###  it was the same $60 fee but the driver had an old beat up car with a huge crack on the windshield , practically no ac and everytime he stopped we prayed the brakes were not going to go b/c they were screaching the entire trip  ###  it was daylight on the way back so we could see more  ###  not really much to see other than cattle grazing , mountains off in the distance , and some shed type dwellings  ###  it was a little sad honestly  ###  what amazed us most is that there was not one street sign or traffic light  ###  i could not imagine ever renting a car here  ###  as the driver approached an intersection he would just lay on the horn as if to announce watch out  ###  i 'm coming through  ###  lots of mopeds weaving in and out as we were driving along too  ###  kids hitch - hiking on the side of the road on their way to school  ###  the resort itself as most others have written is absolutely beautiful  ###  the grounds are a landscape paradise  ###  perfectly groomed trees line the street as you approach the gated resort  ###  the flamingos , parrots , hens and other various wild life are fun to see  ###  the lobby is large and beautiful  ###  we were greeted at check in (8pm ) with 2 glasses of champagne and were quickly taken to our room by our bell - hop  ###  we booked a swim up suite  ###  1st impression was very nice , but not 5 star  ###  the room had a musty smell and there was even a little mold growing above the sink on the ceiling in the bathroom ( as the wk went on we did not notice the smell at all )  ###  nice tile work , clean , and spacious though  ###  we could literally walk out our room and dive into the cascading pool  ###  comfortable 4 poster bed  ###  nice large whirlpool tub , and stocked mini bar other positives  ###  housekeeping always kept the room clean  ###  they 'd put fresh flowers on our towels and turn down the bed at night  ###  i wrote a note requesting more diet coke and presidente and everyday they stocked us with more  ###  foodwise we went with low expectations as we 've never really had great food at any of the other all inclusives we 've been to  ###  excellence surpassed our expectations  ###  we enjoyed all the meals we had  ###  the service was great  ###  i liked that there were 7 restaurants to choose from ( one or two closed each night ) and an abundance of bars  ###  also nice not to have to deal with making reservations the day before as w/ other all inclusives  ###  you could eat when you felt like it  ###  i especially liked the trio who came to our table and sang at agave  ###  nice touch along with many other little touches/ ie/ the hostess walks the ladies over to tables arm and arm  ###  if i got up to use the bathroom , i 'd return to my table with my napkin folded  ###  i enjoyed being able to drink as much wine as we wanted with our dinner  ###  chez isabelle was also my favorite as many others have written  ###  i enjoyed my chateau briand although my husband thought his was chewy  ###  he loved the sushi at spice and we both loved the breakfast buffet  ###  they even had a guy playing piano one morning  ###  another nice touch , along w/ the bloody mary bar and mimosa station  ###  my favorite were the omelets  ###  there is a huge selection of food available at the buffet always  ###  i enjoyed that much of the dining was in an inclosed area b/c in the past other all inclusives we 've been to w/ outside eating  ###  had either too many bugs or birds waiting to get at your plate when you got up  ###  the entertainment at night was a lot of fun  ###  do not expect broadway but go with an open mind  ###  there are comfy wicker chairs ( find your seat early as they fill up fast ) and staff comes around throughout the show taking drink orders  ###  we went at the end of rainy season so i was expecting rain and lots of mosquitos from what i had read  ###  we packed off , after bite etc  ###  and never needed it once  ###  everyday was sunny and beautiful and not one bug  ###  always a nice breeze too  ###  we took advantage of room service on several occasions and often late at night ie/ after disco closed  ###  the food was always hot and tasty  ###  we also worked out almost daily at the gym which is inside the spa  ###  it 's adequate  ###  they have good music on and i liked how the 1st day when i got on an eliptical a staff member walked over and gave me a towel  ###  
80	please fix the food  ###  my husband  i stayed at the majestic from feb  ###  23 to feb 29 and chose the resort based on trip advisor reviews  ###  our goal was a relaxing vacation at a nice beach , and that wish was fulfilled  ###  there were many things we liked , but some things need attention to make this resort deserving of its ranking  ###  things that were great : ? check in was smooth  ###  richard greeted us , showed us to our room and helped with our restaurant reservations  ###  such a nice man  ###  he was very helpful before our stay and really showed personal attention  ###  we had booked a swim up room (2129) and we were not disappointed  ###  it was worth the extra money and we loved the location , about halfway between the lobby  beach  ###  the room smelled just a little musty , but i brought a room freshener , which took care of the problem  ###  the bed was very comfortable and bedding looked fairly new  ###  the room was very quiet and we slept well  ###  air conditioning was adequate , and easy to control  ###  the room was clean with only two mosquitoes sighted and no bites during our stay  ###  the robes and treats ( champagne , fruit platter , sushi , and grapes  wine ) delivered on four nights were a nice touch  ###  ? the beach and pool were beautiful and it was wonderful to be able to get chairs and palapas without playing the towel game  ###  the beach is great for walking and is so beautiful with all the palm trees  ###  the pool was always clean and has many quiet nooks to hang out  ###  the swim up bar was a lot of fun at happy hour  ###  drinks were good  ###  the signature majestic drink is delicious  ###  they make a great cosmo at the downstairs poolbar  ###  the staff were very friendly for the most part and were always smiling and happy  ###  it helps to smile and try to speak a little spanish  ###  the animation team was friendly , but not overbearing  ###  they tried to get guests involved , but took no for an answer if you weren?? interested  ###  ? evening entertainment on the plaza , the sax player and combo , were very good  ###  ? it was nice to be able to go to restaurants without making reservations  ###  ? the resort is a nice size  ###  you can walk from the beach to lobby in about 5 minutes  ###  needs improvement : ? where?? chef gordon ramsey when you need him  ###  he?? have a field day here  ###  the food in itself will probably keep us from returning  ###  the buffets are reminiscent of college cafeteria food  ###  soups and hot foods were cold , cold foods were warm  ###  beef was tough  ###  things weren?? displayed to even attempt to make them look appetizing  ###  there weren?? enough tongs for all the dishes  ###  ( this sounds picky , but when you think of how many people touch the tongs , it really spreads illness  ###  we did have a few good restaurant meals , but service was often rushed  ###  you didn?? finish one course before the next arrived  ###  some of the restaurant meals were awful  ###  ( i can give you more details if you like  ###  breakfast at the main buffet is probably the best meal of the day  ###  lunch is not good anywhere  ###  at lunch there are too many logjams at the buffets  ###  people pile up waiting for pasta , grilled items , and panini sandwiches  ###  they need to come up with a way to serve simple , tasty , appetizing food quickly for lunch  ###  and what is that tacky hut doing in the middle of the palapa restaurant  ###  ? maintenance is an issue  ###  i can see this place going down hill fast from lack of maintenance  ###  things stayed broken all week  ###  the ice machine near our room didn?? work  ###  one of the shower heads at the beach shower broke off  was never fixed  ###  a halogen light kept blinking off  on at the plaza stage where the sax player  band play  ###  walkways around the pool have potholes  ###  there?? a path at the bottom of one of the bridges at the pool that is pieces of stones just sitting in some shale  ###  people kept tripping on the stones all week  ###  this really needs fixed before someone gets hurt  ###  on the other hand , we saw a maintenance worker polishing the floor in the lobby at 9 pm while people were trying to walk through or sit and relax  ###  this seemed like bad timing to me  ###  ? sickly landscaping  ###  trees and shrubs don?? look healthy  ###  grass is lumpy  ###  no birds or animals  ###  ? not enough public restrooms by the pool  beach  ###  please put up some paper towel holders and more soap dispensers  ###  there is just one soap dispenser per restroom and very inconveniently placed  ###  paper towels got wet setting on the sink counter  ###  i saw so many people go to the bathroom , rinse their hands without using soap then proceed to the palapa restaurant where they touch those tongs that are in such short supply  ###  no wonder people get sick  ###  on our third day , i was sick and confined to my room with diarrhea , vomiting and severe headache  ###  i was unable to eat or drink much the following day , but was ok for a few days , then the sickness returned just in time to get on the plane  ###  my husband never got sick , but we ate different things  ###  tiny plastic drink cups  ###  make sure you bring your own cup  ###  iberostar used larger plastic cups that they rewashed  ###  it bothered me to think about how much plastic was going into the garbage between the bottled water and the drink cups  ###  
80	a fair stay at the majestic  ###  we stayed at the majestic from february 16 to the 25th 2008  ###  i have a mixed opinion of the hotel  ###  we had great weather and the resort was clean but it was not the best  ###  check in : i called the day before and spoke to someone in reservations and explained that we would arrive late  ###  i requested connecting rooms or rooms next to each other with 2 double beds  ###  i also explained that since we have young children we wanted a room in a quiet area  ###  i was told we would be assigned rooms 2203 and 2204  ###  we checked in at night  ###  there were no adjacent rooms  ###  i saw our rooms cards and the rooms we were assigned were crossed off  ###  i asked why they were given away and they told me it was because of late check in  ###  we were given two rooms near the theatre and overlooking the construction  ###  they both had king beds and we were told that they would have another bed in the rooms waiting  ###  the rooms did not have beds waiting  ###  one room had a spill on the floor of something sweet and was hot and full of flies  ###  the other room was fine  ###  it was 2 hours before they brought the beds and cleaned the room  ###  the construction woke us up at 7:30am  ###  two days later , we were moved to building 2 in the middle to far end of the resort overlooking the pool  ###  it was much better  ###  rooms : building #1 overlooks the grand paradise resort next door  ###  if you are in the high number of building #1 you will see and smell the restaurant  ###  building #2 ( the best in my opinion ) overlooks the pool and has some ocean view rooms  ###  it is generally quiet and easy access to the pool and beachbuilding #3 overlooks the other side of the pool and in the early numbers some of the resort and wedding gazebo  ###  it is the second best building as long as you are not near the theater which is noisy at night  ###  building #4 is by far the worst unless you are really close to the beach  ###  it over looks the construction and the early numbers are near the theater as well  ###  the rooms are spacious compared to other resorts  ###  they have open bathrooms which makes them look larger but can be embarrassing if you end up getting a sick stomach at night  ###  there is little to no privacy if you are staying with friends and not close family or if you are staying with teenagers who like to use the bath alone  ###  the beds are aged and in need of replacement  ###  the pillows are foam  ###  the bedspreads have been used a few too many times  ###  in one room we had a new sofa but in the other the sofa was worn through and ragged  ###  in other words , the furnishings can use a replacement  ###  they also have few drawers to put your things but adequate closet space  ###  they give terry robes which are nice and the bath towels are large  ###  in one room the drain on the tub was broken and the magnifying mirror was torn from the wall  ###  these things were never fixed during the stay  ###  there is a nice terrace to sit outside with a rack for hanging clothes  ###  the maids always keep the rooms clean  ###  the mini bar has 4 bottles of water , soda and two beers daily  ###  the grounds : the grounds are kept clean at all times  ###  the staff takes pride and picks up all of the debris daily  ###  the grounds are large and spacious and the resort never appears crowded  ###  the main pool is huge  ###  it is bigger than at most resorts  ###  there is more than one quiet area for people who do not prefer the entertainment and activities by the pool  ###  there is always a chair and never a fight for an umbrella or a seat which is nice  ###  the only bad part about the pool was more a complaint from my children  ###  it was boring  ###  it is just a pool  ###  there is not a water slide , a wave pool , a lazy river , or a water recreation area for children as in most of the resorts we have visited  ###  it is just a huge pool  ###  of course , that didn?? bother me but it did make it a little more difficult to keep the children entertained  ###  the beach is gorgeous  ###  the water was fairly calm and clean  ###  the sail boats and kayaks are free as well as boogie boards although there is a wait to sail  ###  there are plenty of umbrellas and showers as you exit the beach  ###  the sand is soft and the beach is cleaned daily  ###  the food : in my opinion , the food was very limited  ###  it was probably the poorest selection of any buffet in an all - inclusive from my experience  ###  we are not picky eaters  ###  there was always something to eat  ###  it just wasn?? great  ###  for example , at the buffet , they would often run out of something , like grilled chicken midway through the lunch service and not have more  ###  also , there was just less selection  ###  a la carte restaurants were a little better ?  ###  not great but better  ###  we enjoyed the churrasco at the rodeo steak house  ###  we did not enjoy the lobster at the seafood as it was severely overcooked  ###  we enjoyed fresh fish at the mexican and the oriental as well as fairly good egg rolls  ###  the best part about the restaurants was that most did not require a reservation  ###  you can just show up and they will normally seat you within a few minutes  ###  the only required reservations are the hibachi and the gourmet  ###  the hibachi was disappointing  ###  it was not done like the other resorts or like our local hibachi restaurants  ###  the cook just cooked ?  ###  however , on other nights i heard people cheering so it is possible that it was just our cook that was new and not all of the cooks  ###

79	beyond excellence indeed  ###  flexibilitymy husband and i ( mid 50' 's ) traveled to excellence from jan 4-10 ,2008  ###  we missed our plane out of jfk and had our agent call the hotel to see if we could add a day to the stay since we would be a day late  ###  there was no problem and we were relieved  ###  travel to hotelwhen you get off the airplane in punta cana keep walking and pay the tax fee to get in  ###  get your luggage and then exit where you will be met by whatever hotel folks you booked with  ###  usually you board a van  ###  the trip to excellence was around an hour and 45 minutes on pretty pot - holed roads  ###  some pot holes were the size of volkswagons  ###  upon arrivalsince we upgraded to the excellence club which was totally worth it we were immediately met by the hotel guy who took our luggage and escorted us to the excellence club where they offered us wine/champagne etc  ###  check in was swift and quite friendly  ###  they explained how the room works , 24/7 everything you want at your service , drinks , food , internet stations (3 in the room ) , a porch , tv , books and nice furniture  ###  we ended up going there every day for snacks and drinks after the beach  ###  and used the internet which was usually available with no hassle  ###  they will also give you towels if you ask for the beach or pool  ###  wow - be careful  ###  the room was great off a pretty courtyard with palm trees and a big jacuzzi tub  ###  everything in the bar was at your disposal and part of the price you paid  ###  do not drink any water that is not bottled  ###  they give you plenty of bottled water so drink that  ###  it is ok to drink the water in the restaurants , as apparently that is bottled as well  ###  the first morning we walked out of the room and started down the stairs ( we were on the 3rd floor ) and i slipped down the stairs on my tailbone and stopped myself with my right hand  ###  it had rained over night and everything was extremely slippery  ###  i thought my hand was broken  ###  my husband found me ice right away  ###  i ended up seeing the resort doctor when the pain was too bad to take and he immediately gave me a shot and a splint and sent us on our way in a taxi about an hour and a half away to the medical clinic for xrays  ###  we had to show our passport and insurance cards  ###  they treated us great and quickly at the clinic but the xrays were taken with no protection ( bad  ###  and we had to sign 2 blank credit card slips in case our us insurance did not pay up  ###  if it rains , as it does every day for a few minutes in the late afternoon , be careful  ###  we met a lady who almost broke her collar bone after falling on wet floors as i did  ###  example of excellenceobviously this put a damper on things but the resort was so excellent that it made up for it  ###  one night we decided to use the jacuzzi in the room and it was not filling up correctly  ###  i mentioned it to the lady at the club and she said she would take care of it for us  ###  when we returned that night it was filled with hot bubble bath and rose petals in the tub and on the bed with chocolates  ###  the people who work there are dirt poor  ###  tip them whenever you get a drink  ###  a dollar is like gold to them  ###  we left a few bucks every morning and evening on the bed pillow for the morning and evening maids  ###  we could not believe the conditions under which they must live so be generous  ###  we saw a bunch of slobs from all over the world who treated the help like [ - -] and never pulled out a dime  ###  dont ' be ignorant - if you can afford this resort , give a bit of it up to people who work their asses off and are really poor  ###  we met one guy on the beach who was haitian and his story was beyond pathetic  ###  i tipped him $20 one day because i knew that would give him more than one meal a day for a couple of months  ###  at least i knew where my charity was going  ###  restaurants - -when you enter the restaurants , the hostess asks you to take her arm  ###  the breakfast buffet in the main dining room was great every day  ###  many good choices and always fresh fruit  ###  , their dr hot chocolate , desserts , hot foods of all kinds and drinks  ###  barcelona was great , the mexican was great , the italian was ok , the french was great  ###  the asian sucked really bad  ###  do not bother  ###  the grill was good , the lobster place was ok if you like warm water lobster ( we 're from new england so it was not our favorite )  ###  you can even get pizza all day  ###  try the fresh fish any time , as it is great  ###  lunches can be had at several places including the beach bar and the buffet place and we liked that best for the many choices  ###  no reservations are needed anywhere except if you go to dinner between 7 and 9 you may need to wait just a bit at some places  ###  we rate the food generally a 7/10  ###  we spent most of the time on the beach  ###  there was no problem getting huts or chairs and even the raised beds and hammocks  ###  there was plenty of room and privacy  ###  not crowded at all  ###  sand was amazing  ###  we walked to the right of the beach all the way to the next resort which was a dump compared to excellence  ###  poolvery beautiful with lots of chairs  ###  plenty of pool mats available with no problem  ###  at night they had different entertainment from karaoke to stage shows that were pretty hokey but at least there was something to do  ###  the guy who plays the sax in the lobby lounge is amazing as well  ###  if you want to drink 24/7, you can do that pretty easily as they constantly ask you what you want to drink  ###  almost to the point of being annoying ( i 'm not a drinker really but my husband is )  ###  spa and work out roomwe did not use the spa , as it was way too expensive , but we did use the gym treadmills every day  ###  take a towel and a water bottle as complimentary when you are there  ###  do not bother buying at the stores , too expensive and nothing particularly interesting  ###  you can walk the property pretty easily for a good walk as well  ###  there are tennis courts (2) and pool tables etc  ###  at an outdoor bar as well  ###  if you are into games , they have them at the pool everyday  ###  we like peace and quiet so we avoided that stuff  ###  conclusionwe would return to this resort again in a minute  ###  
79	good times all around i really think some people must have stayed at a different hotel then we did  ###  we stayed at the resort from oct  ###  29th to nov  ###  5th , and we had a wonderful time  ###  while i would not rate the experience a five star event , i would give it four stars  ###  here are some of our takes on the stay : restaurants : advice , if you go open air , go later in the evening , when it is cooler  ###  the restaurants are open until 11:00, so go late if you are too hot  ###  the grill is open air , but my wife thought here ribeye was the best meal she had all week  ###  we ate there the last night we were there  ###  i ordered the mixed grill  ###  way too much food  ###  two steaks , a pork chop and a chicken breast  ###  spice : i really liked the japanese seafood curry and my wife liked the tempura shrimp  ###  the sushi was average , but good  ###  the rice appeared a bit sticker than fresh , but the seafood was great on it  ###  we had the combo and the maki  nagimi  ###  i don?? think anything on those two appetizers was even raw  ###  the salmon was smoked  ###  chez isabelle : we ordered off their special menu that was inside the regular menu  ###  we both had the?  ###  i don?? speak french and my spell check is not helping me here??hey chatuebrion ( steak )  ###  it was two large slices perfectly cooked and tender as can be  ###  toscana : we ate breakfast here and an occasional lunch  ###  it is buffet style  ###  edger makes a great omelet  ###  lunch there was also buffet and ok  ###  barcelona : never ate there  ###  oregano : pizza is good  ###  the cheese is a little more pungent than the us , but good  ###  agave : outdoor restaurant that is in a spanish style courtyard , so there is no breeze  ###  it was hot , but tolerable  ###  go later if you want it to be cooler  ###  we ate there the second night and we had not learned to eat later in the evening if we were open air  ###  lobster house : we ate there the first night  ###  it was ok , the lobster was a bit overcooked , but i liked it  ###  i ordered the spicy version , which i was told was ??uy calliente , ?  ###  but it was mild at best  ###  there was really nothing too spicy served in the whole place  ###  pool : loved it  ###  we got there when the place was about 65% occupied , so we never had an issue finding a place to lay our towels  ###  i am an early riser , so i would stake out a cabana layout each morning  ###  i?? say , if you want one of those , 8:30 is the latest you?? get one  ###  there are also beds with slotted covers almost always available  ###  it is humid and hot , but a quick jump in the pool and you??e good to go  ###  water volley ball was fun too  ###  it was at the pool by the santa domingo area at 11:00 and 3:00 every day  ###  also , every day , about 12:30 to 1:00 a gentleman walks around with pizzas for anyone to have  ###  they are little?  ###  8-10 inchers and good  ###  there is also little containers of food at the bars ( finger sandwiches and fruit )  ###  at 12:30, every day , they also cook on the beach  ###  it is usually not ready until 1:00, but they had hamburgers , a white bratwurst - kind of sausage , there version of chorizo and chicken two or three times we were there  ###  they also had??rap , i am butchering a languagebeach : a lot cooler than the pool area , as the breeze is not buffered  ###  we never laid out there , but walked it  ###  vendors : the venders on property are extremely pushy  ###  if they offer you $50 on some item , it is probably worth $17-20, so bargain  ###  also , there are huts at the end of the beach , after building 15  ###  it is 20 feet from the pool  ###  nancy?? is the best , in my opinion  ###  you don?? really get to bargain with her , but that is because her prices are already better than anyone else??  ###  there is also a fake target , wal - mart and shop - for - less huts  ###  we bought a sarong at shop - for - less for $18 and got the exact one , in a different color from nancy for $11  ###  so , my suggestion is to go there  ###  also , the more you buy from her the better the prices get  ###  sunscreen : bring it  ###  we met another couple , from ny , who stated they had never burned in their lives , so they did not bring sunscreen  ###  they bought it after day two  ###  bug spray : on tuesday night they do a dominican republic night on the beach , with all the local foods and such  ###  they have bug spray for you when you walk into the area , if you want  ###  my wife only put on a little bit in the room , as she had no bug bites all week , thinking she was safe  ###  we had to leave the dinner after 10 minutes here feet were getting so eaten alive  ###  she got five bug bites in that 10 minutes  ###  so , the beach and the sports bar you need to wear it a lot  ###  in general , maybe a squirt or two  ###  it was a great time  ###  we loved it and would return to the hotel  ###  if you want to be angry or frustrated , then you will be  ###  if you want to have a great time and can overlook this or that , then you will have a great time  ###  br/>i hope this helps  ###  
79	average resort returned aug 22 from my 1 week stay at the melia  ###  i 'll begin my review with the flight to punta cana  ###  as all should know by now tropical storm faye hit the dominican republic on the 15th of august  ###  needless to say that our trip was the most eventful journey my family and i have ever made  ###  i have personally traveled just about every continent and i have never experienced what i lived through that day  ###  first of all , i had been checking throughout the week the national hurricane center weather outlook for the region  ###  there was activity brewing out in the atlantic and it appeared to intensify as the week progressed  ###  on the day of the flight i had checked the depression 's progress and it was sitting right off the coast of dr  ###  it was clear that the storm was more than just rain  ###  however , the carrier air transat elected to have the flight 's departure proceed from montreal  ###  i had advised them that the weather was not good and they should reassess their decision  ###  unfortunately the carrier proceeded as planned  ###  well needless to say that the flight never landed at punta cana but was diverted to puerto plata but only after an attempt was made to land at la romana  ###  the flight landed at 6:00 pm  ###  all passangers were stranded in the airport as there was no flight arrangements into punta cana  ###  the plane we were on left for toronto without any announcements  ###  the transat representative addressed the passengers at 9:30 pm and gave the following said that we have to leave by bus for punta cana , an 8 hour ride , or spend the rest of our vacation in puerto plata and try to find a hotel at our own expense  ###  all hotels were apparently booked  ###  well having heard that a tragic accident occurred the same day resulting in the death of 22 tourists did not assure us that this decision was the right one  ###  nonetheless we had no choice but to leave the airport as the police were called in to evict us as midnight was approaching  ###  as a side bar note , we all felt as if we were a nuisance to the dominican people working in the airport  ###  we were told by the senior police officer that he wanted to go home to sleep and we were the ones keeping him from doing that  ###  so we had to leave  ###  incredible to believe that one of this country?? important source of foreign currency comes through tourism and yet they fail to adequately make the tourist feel welcomed  ###  we left the airport at 12:15 am and arrived at the punta cana airport at 7:40 am to be separated in respective resort buses  ###  by the way the travel was adventurous and at times terrifying  ###  now for my review : pre - travel plan : my wife , my nine - year old son and myself were vaccinated for hep a and b ( two doses each )  ###  my son had taken dukoral , my wife nothing and i had taken daily dosage totaling 60 million cfu of probiotic pills over a two week period to counter td  ###  we all ate salads , fruit and vegetables ( cooked and raw )  ###  as for water , we drank bottled and water that was said to be bottled by the waiters  ###  also , we had sodas with ice  ###  my son and i had no complications  ###  my wife had all the symptoms of td for one day  ###  she did not need medical attention but she sure watched what she ate afterwards  ###  all three of us took malaria pills ( melarone ) with no side effects whatsoever  ###  our decision to take the pills was based on the advisory notice  ###  i have traveled extensively , especially to africa , and being stricken with malaria is a serious issue  ###  we did not see a single mosquito while we were there but one of the couples who we met on the plane had a mosquito infestation in their room  ###  their three kids and them were bitten quite a few times on the arms and face  ###  one of the kids came down with a fever two days later  ###  i am glad that we did take the pills  ###  check - in :  ###  there were three couples from our flight that were checking in  ###  so check - in was 25 minutes and we were told to go have breakfast as the room was not ready  ###  didn?? quite understand why as the resort was not full  ###  i did inquire about some sort of credit for the night that we did not stay but were politely told that it wasn?? their fault  ###  so one hour later , we went to our rooms and the luggage had not yet arrived  ###  after several calls , the luggage arrived  ###  the front desk was polite but no smiles as if we were disturbing them from their conversations  ###  rank : 2  ###  5site : it has been stated many times that this place covers a lot of acreage  ###  well you just have to experience it  ###  there are trains that will take you throughout the caribe and tropical sections of the resort  ###  however , you can definitely flag down a cart that will take you where you need to go  ###  or , you can do what i did which was to get one the vacation club concierge to do all the restaurant bookings and arranging for a cart to be at your room when you need it  ###  the landscaping is definitely beautiful and the setting at night gets amplified with the gentle lighting  ###  rank : 4  ###  5 room : our room was in building 1 room 0114  ###  this was a family suite with two double beds , a single bed which could have been used as a sofa , and a sofa also could have been used a single bed  ###  the room was clean but outdated  ###  the bathroom ceiling sprang a leak which took three days to get fixed  ###  there were no bugs  ###  we had clean towels every day along with washcloths that you must ask for  ###  we had thought about upgrading to royal service but the added cost of $70 per person per day for 1 bedroom suite or $90 per person per day for a master suite did not excite me  ###  our room was located no more than 100 feet from either the agora grill or the tropical pool and we were no more than 300 feet from the beach  ###  the agora grill was closed two days after our arrival and were left with the turey grill which was a 5 minute walk from our room  ###  rank : 3  ###  5food : for the first two days we ate our breakfast at the grill restaurants which were open aired and for the balance of our stay we ate the international market place which is closed with a/c  ###  the selection and overall quality is better at the market place  ###  however , it does not mean that the food is better tasting  ###  we basically stuck with hard boiled eggs , juices which were not freshly squeezed , and breads  ###  essentially all of their basic cooking is deep rooted in cooking oil which gets to be hard on the system on a continuous basis  ###  for lunch we stuck with turey  ###  each day came with different selections  ###  although you could stick with pasta and pizza if you wished  ###  the taste was mostly bland on the hot dishes  ###  unfortunately flies were everywhere and over the food  ###  i guess it is to be expected in an open air environment  ###  as for the a - la - carte restaurants , we consider that the thai ( the pagoda ) to have been the one which very good  ###  
79	overall experience an a but details a c backgroundmy ( now ) husband (34) and i (33) have only a moderate level of travel experience  ###  i have traveled extensively in the u  ###  prior to this  ###  we go on weekend trips now and then , but have never taken a real vacation together until our honeymoon  ###  before booking , we used the suggestions of friends and family , as well as tripadvisior , to decide on our destination and resort  ###  at that time , there were only good reviews of secrets on this site , and we booked our stay with complete confidence that it would be fantastic  ###  reviews prior to our trip made us quite nervous about or choice , but we never considered cancelling  ###  our trip was 7/17 to 7/25/06  ###  arrivali had read enough reviews that i was prepared for different aspects of the arrival : the nontraditional airport , the $10 tourist charge , and even the bus ride  ###  luckily , i was so tired from lack of sleep and the flight that i slept for most of the bus ride to the resort , so it did not seem that bad ( the way back to the airport was a different story - i was very close to getting sick on the bus , and i am not prone to car sickness  ###  when we arrived at the resort , there were many ( probably 12) couples all trying to check in  ###  the coupes ahead of us all got a drink , but the waitress ran out just before she got to my husband and i  ###  when she left , i expected that she 'd return with more drinks for the many couples that had not been served  ###  i was mistaken  ###  we did get cool towels  ###  check - in was fairly quick and easy  ###  roomwe booked an ocean view suite and were given that  ###  ( note : almost everyone there is getting married , on a honeymoon , or celebrating an anniversary , so do not expect an upgrade )  ###  unfortunately , i had ignored the free advice in these reviews about the beautiful 3rd floor rooms with the high ceilings , and never emailed to request a 3rd floor room  ###  when we saw our room , we were very disappointed in many ways  ###  we were on the first floor , which did not lend itself to a good ocean view  ###  i could have lived with that , except for the smell  ###  there was a very strong mildew smell in the room that i could not get past  ###  after deciding that i really could not live with the smell for 9 days , i called the front desk to request a change  ###  after being questioned about the smell and whether the room change was really necessary , i was told that they probably would not be able to accommodate the request until the following day  ###  i accepted that , and decided to make the best of it  ###  during the 24 hours that we were in the room , we determined that we had no robes ( as promised ) , the jets in our jacuzzi tub did not work , and the bed was quite uncomfortable  ###  it really felt more like a boxspring than a mattress ( many couples we met commented on how uncomfortable the beds were , so it was not just us )  ###  we did get our room switched , but only after being politely persistent  ###  at the suggestion of another couple , we enlisted the help of the concierege , and that seemed to get things moving a little more quickly  ###  new room was on the second floor - better view and no smell  ###  tub worked , and we got our robes on the 4th day  ###  however , refridgerator took full 24+ hours to cool down drinks  ###  my only complaints are the same that you 've heard before in these reviews - people stake out there spots early , and do not show up for half the day ( if at all  ###  people hoarde the floats  ###  pool closes earlier than i would have expected  ###  lots of shaded or sunny spots to relax ( but not always the place you 'd prefer )  ###  water is a little rough  ###  breakfast was my favorite , as i loved the omlette station  ###  i second some of the other reviewers ' comments about the difficulty of getting lunch - i would have preferred a couple more a la carte options and was underwhelmed by the beach barbeques  ###  we tried most of the restaurants for dinner  ###  the chinese was just plain bad , although they did have the best dessert there ( chocolate chip cheesecake )  ###  the other restaurants were good but not great  ###  we got pizza a few times , which was quite good , and opted for room service once , which took about 30 minutes and was also good  ###  drinksheed the suggestions in these reviews , and bring a large , insulated cup  ###  after a couple days of melted , warm drinks , we bought insulated coffee mugs in the gift shop ( $10 each ) , and it made a world of difference  ###  drinks seemed to vary between weak and strong  ###  drinks ordered by name varied greatly in taste from bartender to bartended  ###  illnessboth my husband and i experienced some intestinal distress during our stay , even after being careful about the water  ###  my husband 's sickness lasted a full day , but then he was fine  ###  mine was less intense but lasted more than half of our 9 day stay  ###  i tried not to let it ruin our fun , but the twisting , painful stomach cramps sometimes made that difficult  ###  immodium and pepto helped , but bring your own so you do not have to fork over big $  ###  bugsbring bug spray or wipes  ###  we definitely needed them a few nights  ###  excursionswe had planned to do one or two excurions , but our intestinal distress stopped us  ###  there were mixed reviews from other couples we talked with  ###  entertainmentit 's not broadway  ###  it 's not vegas  ###  adjust your expectations accordingly , and you will be entertained  ###  definitely check out the michael jackson impersonator - that was my favorite show by far  ###  the casino was small but fun - won a little $ at the slots and quickly lost it in blackjack ( again , it 's not vegas , so do not expect that )  ###  never made it to the disco  ###  activitiesthere are lots of free activities offered covering a variety of interests  ###  in all honesty , we did not participate in many  ###  several times , we signed up for things ( bike tour , snorkeling , etc ) and were so content relaxing by the pool or ocean with a drink that we cancelled  ###  by the time we tried to sign up for our free horseback riding , it was booked ( so book early in your stay  ###  overall , i really did like that fact that activities were offered but not pushed on us  ###  serviceservice was like the food - inconsistent  ###  some people were pleasant , friendly , and efficient  ###  while no one was outwardly rude , several acted as they would really prefer not to be bothered by our ( reasonable ) requests ( for a drink , utensils , etc )  ###  i will say that while i am now a psychologist , i worked as a waitress on and off during my college years , so i feel that i have some perspective on this  ###  i try not to hold servers responsible for aspects of the service that are beyond their control - length of wait , food quality , etc  ###  that being said , many could have used slightly better people skills  ###  however , they all seemed to be very hard working  ###  we often saw a server at one restaurant at 9:00am for breakfast and at another restaurant at 8pm for dinner  ###  we also learned from one bartender that the staff at the resort works 13 days in a row and then get 3 days off , so they do work hard  ###  tippingseemed to significantly impact service at the bars , less so at the restaurants  ###  helped get a few extra bottles of water , soda , and beer in the minibar  ###  
79	secrets excellence is not excellent  ###  i want to start off this review by stating that although i do expect a certain level of quality and service when traveling i am by no means a vacation snob  ###  i am picky but not a snob  ###  this was my second time in the dr  ###  the first time we ( hubby and i ) stayed at iberostar bavaro in nov 2004 and you can read our review at [ - -] we are the 14th review down so we had a basis of comparison and thought we knew what to expect  ###  we stayed for 4 nights/5 days  ###  overall i?? going to state right up front we thought this resort was no where near a 5 star/6 golden apple resort  ###  after being to other 5 star resorts ( iberostar in the dr , atlantis in the bahamas , aruba , etc ) this is somewhere around a 3  ###  my suggestion for anyone booked at this hotel now or looking to book is to contact your travel agent or tour rep and if you bought insurance switch  ###  it?? free to switch and the only cost is any cost difference from your package to the one you??e switching too?  ###  since you??e paid for a 5 star resort in most cases it will either cost the same or be just a few dollars to switch  ###  no amount of adult only exclusiveness can cover the things that just aren?? 5 star quality and made this vacation less than enjoyable  ###  trust me switch now  ###  let me also state that i booked my travel after reading another review with judy and maries travel ( just do a search and you 'll find them )  ###  this was by far the best decision about this trip that we made  ###  if you are thinking of traveling to the dr and are planning to use a travel agent i would highly recommend them?  ###  heck even if you weren?? planning on using an agent i would still recommend using them  ###  you??l get the same price and probably much better service at your hotel  ###  drive : we got a private transfer instead of riding the bus  ###  we figured with it already being an hour away a private van would be faster than taking the bus?  ###  the drive there was awful as our driver felt compelled to race any car/bus/truck in front of us regardless of how far away it was  ###  also it is very bumpy and terribly scary as there are plenty of pot holes and hills  ###  they are building a new highway which i hope will make the drive through to the resorts more pleasant  ###  in/out : my bil booked a swim - out excellence room however when we booked we just paid for the regular garden view room  ###  when we arrived i was pleasantly surprised that the manager had arranged for us to receive a free upgrade to the excellence club because of maria and judy  ###  i had asked maria to request a 3rd floor room as i had read those are nice and again they delivered  ###  the only issue is that because we didn?? arrive with the other buses we had to wait about 10 minutes until an excellence rep came to get us to walk us to the club to check in  ###  excellence club : although a very nice touch and a great perk i would never ever pay the $70ish a day it costs to actually participate in this unless you really need internet access while on vacation  ###  rooms : these were fairly nice  ###  we were on the third floor , as requested , and i was pleased to find out that they had elevators as i sprained my ankle just before coming  ###  each room has a sink/dressing area , a separate water closet/shower room , and a jacuzzi tub  ###  the beds are definitely hard as rocks  ###  the room was always clean , no bugs , and the maid service was very nice  ###  we had turn down service which is a nice little extra  ###  the only complaint here is that the minibar isn?? an actual refrigerator but more like a high end cooler  ###  so if you opened it often by the end of the day everything would be warm  ###  for a five star resort you would think they could get actual mini fridges  ###  also because we were on the third floor our room never cooled down to where we like it but it was pleasant and workable  ###  oh and make sure you keep the little do not disturb card in your outlet thingy at all times  ###  resort : beautiful grounds  ###  they have a nice little wildlife area and amazingly enough most of the animals stayed within that area  ###  we saw a stray chicken by the pool area where we stayed but that?? about it  ###  we did see plenty of lizards which were cute  ###  the best part of this resort is that there are covered walkways throughout the whole resort and you can walk around from the main lobby to your rooms and other important parts of the resort without getting wet on the few days it rained  ###  this resort is much smaller than iberostar but just as lovely  ###  the bugs here however are another story and if you do come to secrets bring bug spray  ###  i sprayed daily and was fine until the last night when i ran out and the next day was scratching like crazy  ###  pool : secrets has two pools  ###  although we saw the cascading pool since it was on the other side of the hotel we didn?? swim there  ###  we mostly stayed in the big pool ( actually two pools since it?? cut in the middle but a little rock wall ) which runs most of the way horizontally along the beach and resort  ###  the pool is lovely and we were very pleased to see king size beds with mild cover along pool as well as chaise lounges  ###  the pool was about 4  ###  33 ft deep everywhere which was great for everyone except me as i?? 5 foot even and had to stay on my toes the whole time in the water  ###  the blue floaties were hard to find mid day as people stated but we got there early and stayed late so we didn?? have a problem  ###  i must say i don?? understand why they don?? have more of them  ###  obviously they are at a premium and honestly for a 5 star resort they should have at least one per room available  ###  the swim up bar was nice but we mostly stayed on the other end and just had the lovely ladies who circled the area bring us drinks  ###  my biggest complaint about the pool is that if you are short like i am getting in and out of the pool is difficult  ###  stairs are located throughout the pool area but are spaced so far apart that i had to walk , on tippy toes , probably over 25 feet from where we were to the closest staircase  ###  the only walk in access was on the far left side of the pool  ###  not a big deal unless you really need to use the ladies room  ###  this basically caused to me to stay out of the pool most of the day  ###  beach : very pretty but very rough  ###  if you are used to the east coast waters , like ocean city , md , then this is pretty similar to high tide  ###  the only difference is that because the water is knee deep so far out the waves are breaking several times and cause a huge rip current  ###  we are beach people and love to play in the waves but even we found it a tad rough  ###  nightlife : the casino , where we spent most of our time , was probably twice the size of the iberostar  ###  although it had a craps table it was never opened which disappointed my husband  ###  we mostly played blackjack and roulette and had a very nice time  ###  this casino got pretty busy at night and honestly was lots of fun  ###  however as the brochure from the hotel states beware of the keno game  ###  they suck you in by giving you a free turn to start but it?? a loosing game and we never saw anyone leave winning at this game all 4 nights we played there but saw several people loose hundreds if not thousands of dollars  ###  we tried to catch two shows but honestly unless you show up 30-40 minutes before the show starts you??l never find a seat where you have a good view and can hear well  ###  what we saw were okay and probably good given where you are  ###  this isn?? vegas and we never expect a vegas show but the sound quality could be improved  ###  also shows starting at 10pm are a little late??ust my opinion  ###  we never went to the disco as it didn?? open till 11pm and honestly was quite a walk  ###  food : the food here was just plain terrible  ###  i don?? know a single person at the resort that i spoke with that thought the food was any where near a 5 star resort  ###  
79	beautiful , would return , but has some problems i took my mother to excellence for her birthday  ###  it was originally scheduled as a couples trip , but that did not work out  ###  almost everyone is a couple , but i did not feel uncomfortable  ###  the entrance process at the airport was very smooth and quick  ###  we had a prearranged transport bus  ###  they usually make multiple stops at various resorts , so if you do not want to do that , you may want to take a cab ( $65)  ###  the ride was worse than i expected , even after reading all the reviews  ###  the road was only partially paved in areas , and huge potholes were all along it  ###  we were told that local traffic had been routed onto the road due to repairs  ###  our ride took 90 minutes , even with no stops at other resorts  ###  when we arrived at excellence , check - in was quick  ###  we were not greeted with champagne and warm towels , as other guests were  ###  the lobby and other common areas were very nice  ###  we had a problem with our room  ###  since we were not a couple , we had requested a room with two beds  ###  they explained that i would not get the upgrade i paid for , and that we would have to wait until the next day to move  ###  our first room was very nice , bld  ###  2, with a great ocean view  ###  unfortunately , groups of drunk people ran up and down the breezeways from 11 pm until 3 am , yelling , etc  ###  we were happy to move to a quieter section of the hotel ( bld  ###  it was a garden view , still very nice  ###  the main problems we had were with the front desk  ###  in the new room , the safe did not work , and the front door to the room would not close  ###  we had to call twice to get anyone to come , and they take their time  ###  the front desk offered us some kind of compensation ( their suggestion ) for changing rooms , but gave us nothing , and told us no when we asked about it later  ###  on the day of our departure , we called twice to have our luggage brought to the lobby  ###  both time we were told someone was en route , but no one ever showed up  ###  we ended up taking it ourselves , and were almost late getting it on the bus ( after waiting so long for the bellman )  ###  the grounds , pools , and beach were immaculate and beautiful  ###  the water directly in front of the resort was too rough to swim ( i am a strong swimmer ) , but a ten minute walk in either direction led to much calmer water  ###  poolside/beach drink service was spotty , but the bars are close by at the pools  ###  we did tip our servers , but it did not change the level of service  ###  you do have to grab a couple of towels early , and if you want to sit in a certain area , save your chairs with your towels  ###  we could usually find a float when we wanted one  ###  the dinner meals were excellent  ###  we did not eat at the grill ( ate there for lunch often ) , or agave  ###  we never had to wait , but we are early eaters  ###  after 7-7:30 pm , you might have to wait , especially at chez isabelle  ###  the breakfast and lunch food was pretty standard all - inclusive fare  ###  there is no outdoor cafe , which is quite inconvenient  ###  one day i went inside , got pizza , and brought it out to the pool  ###  apparently the servers will deliver it , but only to certain areas of the pool ( ours told us no )  ###  we did tip our dinner servers , and our lunch servers when we had them  ###  at breakfast , someone will bring you one beverage , but after that , you 're pretty much on your own  ###  you can get your own juice/bloody mary/mimosas  ###  the animals at the resort are darling  ###  we had good timing , because the turkeys , a peahen , and multiple chickens had babies  ###  there are flamingos , ducks , turtles , and parrots  ###  do not touch the parrots  ###  the seem tame and friendly , but they are not  ###  one of them clawed and pecked my head , and bit my finger  ###  the activities people are great  ###  we did water aerobics every day with andreas and rey  ###  they also had lots of games and pool activities , if you want to join  ###  i enjoyed the free horseback riding  ###  it says you get 30 minutes , but we got 45-60 minutes  ###  the michael jackson show was worth watching  ###  we watched to 70s -80s show , and it was not very good  ###  not worth the mosquito bites  ###  we used tons of mosquito spray , but still got about 10-15 bites each  ###  the resort shops are pretty lame  ###  the beach vendors are too aggressive , and seemed quite dodgy  ###  they allow vendor booths at the resort on tue , thur , and sun  ###  we did buy some items there , and were able to bargain for less than half the original ( ridiculous ) prices they give you  ###  the swim - up rooms seemed really nice  ###  if i go again , i will book one  ###  bld 1,3, and 4 are more private by the small pool  ###  the others are closer to the action at the main pools  ###  i did not find the resort workers to be all that friendly , but they were not unfriendly , either  ###  the service was adequate to good  ###  most people there did not seem to speak any language but spanish , so brush up before you go if you want to chat  ###  probably our biggest regret was taking the helicopter back to the airport  ###  it is $200 per person , and definitely not worth the money  ###  you are supposed to get a 25 minute tour  ###  we got 15 minutes , max  ###  a vip travel agent was supposed to meet us , give us our luggage ( which we had to personally watch get put on the bus ) , and take us to check - in  ###  sounded great to us  ###  no one met us , we were dropped at some remote helipad , and no one spoke english at all  ###  through workers pointing and whistling , we went to what looked like a waiting area  ###  
79	lovely place , but prob  ###  not going back hello all  ###  we stayed at the melia caribe tropical for 6 days from 4/20 to 4/25  ###  i 'll try to write an objective review despite the fact that my husband and i are still sick with traveler 's gastric issues after being home for four days  ###  this has never happened in our travels and we 've been to several countries/islands in the last 8 years  ###  we also had a petty theft ( and we live in nyc and have never been robbed ) and we did not have great weather  ###  i 'll also try to write a thorough review as i have appreciated the time other travelers have taken to inform me in the past  ###  i 've posted this with headings so if you 're not interested you can skip over some parts  ###  arrivalthe arrival at punta cana airport was unremarkable and similar to other 's reports  ###  we purchased a $10  ###  00 tourist card and then stood in a long line to hand it over to someone a few feet away who also stamps your passport  ###  i recommend one of you get in the line for the tourist card and the other start to wait in the custom 's line to save time  ###  the airport is charming , open construction with thatched roof  ###  there is no jet way you walk to the main terminal after descending the stairs from the plane  ###  the airport is very clean and simple and there is the steady beat of island drums and costume - clad young girls to welcome you to the facility  ###  transferwe had pre - booked a roundtrip transfer with our trip and we found the booth quickly and were escorted to a modern , clean van  ###  it was extremely humid that day and they put the ac on quickly for us  ###  we got to the hotel in about 20 minutes or so  ###  check - ini took note from someone else on these boards and visibly placed a $5  ###  00 bill on top of my reservation papers on the counter when i spoke to the front desk clerk  ###  my intention was to have a room near the pool and beach since that was our primary reason for visiting  ###  at first he gave us a room near the lobby/restaurants but i asked him to look again  ###  he did and gave us an ideal location ( building 27) that is near the caribe beach , pool and one of the beach grills  ###  he smiled as i slid the $5  ###  00 bill over to him after he assigned us a good location  ###  we were greeted immediately with cold beer and fruit punch upon check - in  ###  a young woman approached us under the guise of welcoming us to the resort and insisted we would receive a welcome package and gift by visiting a desk just past the check - in  ###  she walked with us a bit and was very charming  ###  when i realized that we were being escorted to the time share desk we politely declined and wished them a nice day and walked away towards our room  ###  the time share sales people were certainly present often through our visit , but we found that by simply raising our hand and smiling no that they did not press us  ###  it was not as irritating as i feared it would be by reading some of the previous reviews  ###  roomwe had a deluxe junior suite which was fine  ###  the room was very clean , a decent size with a small couch , lounge chair , desk and coffee table  ###  the ac worked very well , the decor was tasteful and fresh and we had a little terrace overlooking a garden area  ###  the bathroom is fairly large and has a bidet  ###  the tub is pretty high which could be tricky for a senior citizen or a short person like me  ###  : ) we were given a bottle of rum and some little soaps and a heart - shaped candle the first two days of our visit  ###  we paid the $2  ###  00 a day to use the safe  ###  i found it necessary to actually place a reminder paper note over the spigot in the sink because after a night out or when you 're tired it could be asy to brush your teeth with the water or drink from it accidently  ###  the room did have a strong musty smell - -but there was no mold anywhere  ###  i brought some spray perfume and sprayed when we got there  ###  i have asthma and was worried about the mold - -but i had not problems - -although i took precautions by using my inhalers for a week before the trip  ###  getting aroundit was very humid for most of our stay and although we 're typically very big on walking , we found ourselves taking the little train around the resort most of the time  ###  the cobblestones were not comfortable to walk on - -even with rubber soled shoes and when they are wet they are extremely slippery  ###  the train came often and it was fun at first  ###  it was a nice chance to chat with others at the resort and learn about their stay and recommendations  ###  it can be a little confusing at first to figure out where you 're going - -but someone on the train always knows and can tell you  ###  sometimes we 'd just ask the train driver before we got on how many stops to ___ and they 'd usually be able to communicate that to us  ###  several times we got picked up at the little train stop by some of the royal service guys on the golf carts  ###  when they 're not busy shuttling people they randomly stop and ask if you want a ride  ###  they were always good spirited and sweet and we tipped them a buck or so  ###  foodwe 're foodies who live in nyc and we tried to mentally adjust to prepare for okay food  ###  the food would be comporable in our opinion to lower level catering food - -with a couple exceptions that were better  ###  for example , the japanese restaurant - -which was fine  ###  there was no great food to be had anywhere and we did not really expect that  ###  ( the pizza at the beach grill was pretty good ) the a la carte restaurants were really pretty - -lots of ambience and beautiful architecture  ###  they really have so much of this right except for much of the food is overcooked or tough and the sauces are either bland or sugary  ###  i really think if they get the right food manager in this place it could make a huge difference  ###  the menu is fairly sophisticated and the presentation is nice  ###  the service was fine - -the wait staff were extremely sweet and were working their butts off to keep everyone happy  ###  i was dismayed to see many people not leaving any tips for them at all  ###  we felt that $2-3 for a dinner was not a lot to us but cumulatively could mean a lot for these hard - working people  ###  the buffets were where we suspect we got sick  ###  the food is left out in open air - -not air conditioned and it 's just a stomach issue waiting to happen  ###  we tried to choose the things that were being made fresh - -omlettes , pizza , etc  ###  but something got us good  ###  we drank the bottled water , etc  ###  but by day 2 my husband was sick and by day 3 i was sick  ###  we spoke with several other people during our stay who had the same issue  ###  this and the size of the resort would be the reason we would not return  ###  we realize this could happen anywhere - -but when we spoke to others with the same issue - -it made us think twice  ###  if resorts like this want to attract more of the american market , they 're going to have to take far greater steps for precautions against traveler 's illness - -much like mexico has accomplished in their tourist districts  ###  we lost our appetite and felt somewhat lethargic and it really took a lot away from our trip  ###  and we 're the glass is half full type people  ###  getting reservations at the a la carte was a bit of a pain in the butt  ###  it takes about 20 minutes to get through to the reservations line  ###  however , we do not mind eating late and were able to get 9 pm reservations where we wanted to go on most nights  ###  pool and beachwe were on the caribe side ( and yes there are more children on the tropical side ) and the pool is truly fantastic  ###  
79	fun in the sun at excellence  ###  i stayed at the excellence resort with my boyfriend from may 5th -15th  ###  we have stayed at various all inclusive resorts in turks and caicos , mexico , and the dr over the years  ###  i have yet to stay at what i would consider to be a five star resort , and would rate excellence as a four star  ###  before i start going off about what i did not like about my stay , let me make this clear : i truly believe that vacation is like life , it 's what you make of it  ###  i had an awesome vacation , and fail to see how anyone could have any serious regrets about staying at this resort  ###  so many reviews complained about the ride from the hotel  ###  i say relax and take in the view  ###  the closer you get to the resort , the more fields with beautiful views  ###  enjoy the bumpy roads , they are no worse than some of the frost heaves roads we get in nh  ###  the service ca not be beat  ###  all my complaints and requests were handled with a smile , and professionalism  ###  sometimes it took longer than i would have liked to get things fixed ( screen door ) , but again i tried to remember that i was not in the usa , and things move at a different pace  ###  go with the flow  ###  the wait staff , hostesses , front desk , maintenance , bar keep , chefs and so on were attentive and friendly  ###  if you have a chance to meet the su chef waldy at lunch , tell him patty and scott from nh say hello  ###  he really wants peoples opinions of the food , which is not an open attitude you would normally see from a chef  ###  here 's my review on the much debated issue of food : (fyi - i ordered more than one meal frequently at one sitting so i could try everything ) in general lunch and breakfast were my favorite meals of the day  ###  i like a little of everything so these were the meals for me since they were buffets  ###  mexican food is my favorite , so i was in heaven with the non traditional breakfast  ###  although they had all the american fair as well  ###  pancakes , really good bacon , and so on  ###  the pastries were outstanding  ###  dinner was either hit or miss , but i think it 's like that with most places you stay  ###  not every meal is going to be incredible  ###  the best meals i had came from spice ( everything is delicious ) , the mexican restaurant ( try the roast chicken ) , and the mediterranean ( loved the shrimp )  ###  the italian and the french restaurant were disappointing only because my meals were missing key ingredients , such as leeks , mushrooms , and truffles oil  ###  i have found this to be the norm at all the resorts i have stayed at  ###  the absolute worse meal we had was at the grill  ###  i could not imagine that this would have been so bad , but it was  ###  it was really bad  ###  i 'm not sure if it is the quality of meat , but both of our meals were so though that we could not finish them  ###  i was unable to cut through my ribs at all  ###  thankfully , room service saved the night  ###  we did not eat at pizza place , only because we had pizza at lunch all the time , so we did not see the point in having it for dinner also  ###  i 'm not sure who the pastry chef is at the resort , but my hat goes off to him - her  ###  i loved all the desserts  ###  i had the three milk cake everyday ( along with others )  ###  room service rocked , and had it many times at various times of day  ###  i especially enjoyed the chicken taco for a late night snack , as well as the apple pie  ###  sometimes i had to wait over an hour for the food to come , but it was never a big deal  ###  even though it is an all inclusive resort , we tipped everyday  ###  especially the maids , as they make such little money  ###  we brought red sox hats to give out , and it went over very well  ###  we got a big hug from a young kid who was nearly in tears  ###  that was the best part of my vacation  ###  we forgot to bring colored pencils and sharpeners for the staff who has kids at home , ( and there are many  ###  we have friends who build schools in the dr , and they suggest that colored pencils and sharpeners are rare to come by , and would make a nice gift  ###  and of course , anything red sox would be a big hit  ###  we stayed in a jr  ###  suite with a partial ocean view  ###  the view was partial because of a palm tree , but i liked it because it gave us more privacy  ###  my only real complaint about the room was that it was seriously musty when the ac was on , and the ac did not work very well anyway  ###  this did effect my overall stay to some degree , and that was regrettable since i spent so much more money to have the ocean view  ###  i liked the big tub in the room , although i did not use it very much because it was so hot out  ###  who takes a bath in the summer  ###  the overall set up of the room was nice , the bed was hard but comfortable , the bar was well stocked and so on  ###  there was some general wear in the room , but i overlooked it to the best of my ability  ###  the real reason i went to this resort was for the beach  ###  for me , it was one of the best beaches that i have been to in the dr  ###  i had a blast playing in the waves , my boy friend had fun riding the waves on a boogie board  ###  a short walk to the right on the beach will bring you to calm waters for a swim if you are afraid to swim with the waves  ###  i never went out in the water beyond my waist , and never felt as though i was in any danger  ###  if you swim with some common sense , you will have no problem playing in the water  ###  you have to get up early to grab a beach bed , but it is worth it  ###  we only did it once , because it was so hot when we here there , and sought out the shade of the palm trees  ###  in 10 days i only had five minutes of rain  ###  everyday was full on sun , and near 90 degrees  ###  the weather was way better than i thought it would be as i have never gone in may before  ###  it was actually nice to come home to n  ###  and not have it be snowing  ###  here is the one reason i will not be returning to this resort : the massive spraying of pesticides was the worse i have seen at any of the resorts that i have stayed at  ###  i am use to some person going around at night with a back pack of pesticides spraying everything  ###  however , this resort also had a huge truck that drove around every night engulfing the resort in a chemical fog , followed by the back pack man  ###  most of the time i could taste the chemicals in my mouth , yuck  ###  beware people who choose to eat at the grill when this spraying is being done  ###  the tough meet pales in comparison  ###  it defies reason that there would be any bugs , but i believe that they must have evolved to resist the spray  ###  bring bug spray or suffer at night  ###  
79	not a premium hotel but we still had an incredible vacation 5 female friends stayed at barcelo premium punta cana oct 31 to nov 7  ###  the resort itself had many problems but we still had a wonderful time  ###  we reserved 2 oceanview renovated rooms with 4 beds and a roll a way bed  ###  the view was incredible but there were only 3 beds  ###  one rooms was changed very quickly  ###  we were told the other room would receive the roll a way bed  ###  we decided to freshen up since we had been travelling for more than 12 hours  ###  the power went out in our room  ###  only in 1 room  ###  we called the front desk to have that taken care of while we went in search of food  ###  the buffet was closed  ###  the ala cartes were closed  ###  we wandered around til we met raniel from the entertainment staff  ###  he directed us to a small grill that had hot dogs , mystery meat and french fries  ###  they were out of hot dog buns  ###  we explored the resort then returned to our rooms to unpack and get dressed for dinner  ###  power had been restored but we still did not have the roll away bed  ###  once again we lost power in our room  ###  it took more than 3 hours to get it restored  ###  when the roll a way bed arrived it was actually a filthy wooden door with legs on it  ###  this was not acceptable  ###  the assitant manager was not willing to resolve the problem to our satisfaction  ###  we wanted a room to accomodate 3 adults in their own beds  ###  this is what we reserved and paid for  ###  she told us that the only rooms with 3 beds were suites and that we did not pay for a suite  ###  i told her that we did not pay to sleep on a wooden door and that we did pay for a room with electricity  ###  she was willing to move us to another room for the night but we would have to deal with the hotel manager at 9am the next day  ###  we moved to our new room  ###  now we are in a different section of the hotel from our friends  ###  we are also right above the open air buffet  ###  so we listened to pots , pans , dishes and silverware clancking til 11:30pm and it started up again at 5am  ###  after a call to our travel agent back home , we went to see the hotel manager at 9am only to be told that he wo not be in until 4pm  ###  we spotted the assistant manager we spoke to the previous night  ###  today she was very accomadating  ###  she let us tour 2 available suites  ###  1 was dungeon like with a king bed for 3 people  ###  the other one suited our needs perfectly  ###  we lost our oceanview but we did have a view of the fountain and the party pool  ###  the new room was not without problems  ###  no matter how much we tipped we never had enough towels  ###  one morning we were awoken by the sound of rushing water  ###  there was a waterfall coming out of the ceiling in the bathroom  ###  good news was it was landing in the bathtub  ###  overall the food was not good  ###  we lived at the pasta bar for dinner and loved the beef stew at lunch  ###  we ate at roma  ###  we enjoyed marlin so much that we made a second reservation  ###  we wanted to try the other ala cartes and were able to get reservations without a problem but the menu choices did not appeal to us  ###  the hotel should not allow the local vendors to come in 3 nights a week  ###  they are very aggressive and annoying  ###  the hotel gift shops are not impressive  ###  we did go to plaza blanca  ###  we were really disappointed with the shopping there also  ###  lots of junk and they try to rip you off  ###  enough with the negative  ###  we had an incredible vacation despite the hotel  ###  for us it was about having a great time with our friends  ###  we also met lots of wonderful people who we are still in contact with  ###  we will be returning to punta cana in january to visit our new friends but we will not be staying at barcelo  ###  the beach was incredible and the pool amazing  ###  wilson the lifegueard was very attentive  ###  i can not say enough good things about the entertainment staff  ###  adlo , algenis , raniel , franklin and gregorio are great at their jobs  ###  beware of a ballerina named sandy  ###  he kept asking me friend for money  ###  the team that works at the trapeze and trampoline are awesome  ###  i wish i could remembe the girl 's name  ###  one night in the disco she approached us because we were not dancing  ###  we were just enjoying the music  ###  she sat with us for a while and invited us to the trapeze the next day  ###  the beach party was alot of fun  ###  the night club was good  ###  there were not alot of people there but we made our own fun  ###  we went to the casino once  ###  there was no one in there except employees  ###  the new theater is beutiful but the sound system is poor  ###  the theater had the best bar in the resort  ###  the performers in the shows are talented but the productions themselves are low budget/ low quality  ###  i still enjoyed the music of saturday night fever and grease  ###  
79	indifferent my wife and i stayed from dec 29th to jan 5th  ###  we have been to the dominican republic before but at a 3 star resort  ###  this touted itself as a 5 star  ###  first off the disclaimer  ###  i 'm a brit who lives in the us  ###  i have traveled all over so feel i have a somewhat objective view  ###  however , i have come to realize that 5 star hotels differ and one should go into each stay with an open mind  ###  that said , i would not consider this resort 5 star compared to us 5 star hotels  ###  arrival : easy , but be prepared for the drive  ###  the locals are embarrassed by the roads so do not make a big deal of it  ###  i have noticed many more people taking helicopters and i understand why  ###  i 'm sure the roads are a political issue and that tourism will drive road improvements  ###  make sure you know who your travel agency is once you clear immigration because it can get a little bit hectic and confusing once you clear immigration  ###  departure - an absolute mess  ###  maybe it was because we left on a saturday but it 's poorly sign posted and slow  ###  i would not recommend you pay the guys to walk your bags to the ticket gate as the distance is less than 50 yards  ###  if you go to the business class line and you are not traveling business class , you will be turned around only after you get to the desk or luggage check  ###  do not worry when you hear on the pa system that your plane is boarding  ###  it took us an hour to get through check out , and 5 minutes to get through customs and immigration  ###  our plane started boarding 30 minutes before we cleared the ticket counter yet took off an hour or so later  ###  i think it 's a common experience at the airport so do not panic , they wo not leave without you  ###  at least 20 people , if not more came onboard after us  ###  hotel : nice grounds , okay shops , okay food  ###  they do not take reservations and there are no buffet style restaurants  ###  even at breakfast you have to wait to be seated  ###  i do not think this worked well and we had to wait 20-40 minutes to be seated  ###  for lunch we often ate at the excellence club  ###  same for breakfast  ###  i was not expecting outstanding food but i was expecting a little bit better than i got  ###  at the 3 star i stayed at last time , the food was okay and i expected it to be okay  ###  this time the food was better but i expected it to be significantly better  ###  not gourmet , but consistantly better  ###  spice was solid , the gril also  ###  the italian was really disappointing  ###  we were there for new year 's eve where they served a fixed menu  ###  unfortunately , the menu was 80% sea food , neither of which my wife and i eat  ###  thus we got room service  ###  this was a tad disappointing for us  ###  what really surprised me was the inability to get a snack at lunch , unless at the excellence club  ###  some cafe in the middle of the grounds , near the pool where you could grab a sandwich to take back to your lounge chair  ###  or a burger  ###  drinks excellent as was the entertainment  ###  rooms were okay  ###  i do not expect too much from a resort in the dr where the threat of hurricanes means design and cost are kept to a minimun  ###  we did upgrade although the bathroom and shower were really small  ###  expected a little bit more from the patio  ###  i certainly would notr say it was pleasant to sit out on the patio at night to enjoy the view , sititng on plastic chairs on a tiny deck  ###  i noticed very few people chose to use their patios on the garden facing side  ###  tv is predominantly us channels : tbs , ae , tnt , cnn , fox etc  ###  a few european channels thrown in and then there 's the hard core porn channel  ###  this really surprised me  ###  channel 21, everyone on the resort knew channel 21  ###  right in between regualr channels was the hard core porn  ###  and trust me , it 's hard core  ###  the resort does not cater to children at all  ###  if you have young kids , stay at the serenis resort down the road  ###  your kids will be bored at excellence  ###  if you do take young adults , be prepared to block the porn channel  ###  you have adult coontrols , i think on the menu screen  ###  before you settle into your room , make sure everything works  ###  this includes the safe , tv etc  ###  if not , it might be easier to switch rooms than get a replacement , especially in high season  ###  maid service , solid but time wise they were sporadic  ###  i would not complain if they came between 9-12 each day , but sometimes they came at 9 sometimes 5pm  ###  that 's just not good enough  ###  we tipped from the beginning but it did not seem to have an impact on the timeframe  ###  you really do not want to come back to a room at the end of the day to find it 's not cleaned , because then you have to wait on them  ###  they were also inconsistant with the cleaning  ###  some days they would leave wash cloths , other they did not  ###  we used them everyday and requested them everyday , so could not understand why they did not just leave them in the room  ###  same goes for beach towels  ###  some days they would leave 1 sometimes none  ###  again not a huge complaint and nothing that would ruin a holiday or even dent one 's spirits , but if you want to be a 5 star hotel , service has to be consistant  ###  i think my wife and i used that word more than any other to criticise the place  ###  pool area is excellent  ###  beach beautiful and you can walk for hours without being distrubed  ###  the ocean is as dangerous as everyone mentions  ###  you will feel it as soon as you walk in  ###  i could feel my ankles being pulled  ###  
79	nice place but not luxurious resort : 4/5it is a nice , modern and clean place  ###  it was built to resist hurricanes  ###  garden is beautiful  ###  buildings are well maintained  ###  it is very family oriented resorts  ###  it is definitely not for romantic couples  ###  the resort is not as big as it appears  ###  it is easy to walk from the beach to the main building in 8min  ###  bus service is effective  ###  i have seen many larger resorts without bus service  ###  we found the resort not as exotic as other hotels that we have visited  ###  though the look of this hotel is well above other hotels ' look in punta cana  ###  a lot of issue to speak english with the staff  ###  they only speak spanish  ###  if you are a bbq lover you will not like bahia because you wo not eat anything good from the grill  ###  pools : 4/5the pools have a nice design  ###  it is easy for children , elderly and drunk persons to get in and out  ###  the water is warm but not as clean as we would expect  ###  the ocean pool is definitely dirty inside and outside  ###  i have the impression that it does not get cleaned every day  ###  the pools in middle of the resort are clean and you can see the staff washing the pool side at 9pm  ###  the resort does not have enough pool area compared to its size  ###  when we were there the hotel had 50% occupancy and we had to battle for chair and towels ( yes they ran out of towels )  ###  bars and drinks : 3/5one of the most effective bar services that i have ever seen  ###  there are a lot of waiters everywhere  ###  you can get a drink easily there is no line up at noon or in the evening at the reception bars  ###  the drinks have good size and taste  ###  if you want to get drunk you can get a lot of drinks very fast  ###  if you need more rum in your cocktail just ask for a glass of rum on ice and add it to your drink  ###  one of the troubles is the quality of the alcohol that they serve  ###  they use a kind of dollar type very cheap alcohol  ###  basically there is no difference between the taste of the rum/whisky/cognac/tequila  ###  house wine is above average  ###  beer is just as it  ###  music at the lobby bars ca not get worst  ###  they play a kind of retirement home music  ###  food : (5/5) buffet (5/5) applies to breakfast/lunch/dinnerthe buffet is one of the best that we have tasted in the south  ###  everything that they make tasts very good  ###  they cook very similar things day after day but so what  ###  there are about 40 plates to taste  ###  i prefer a resort that makes 40 good plates instead of 100 bad ones  ###  though , there is no prime cut meat or fish  ###  chicken/fish strudels are great  ###  soups are very tasty  ###  they have gourmet pizza  ###  wide selection of real bread  ###  a lot of great local meals adapted to north american taste  ###  first time in many years that i did not eat a single egg for the breakfast during 2 weeks  ###  they had so many good things to taste  ###  just be open minded and taste  ###  steakhouse : 0/5entries are really good  ###  the soup is a must  ###  try the home made chili and the potato skins they are best in their kind  ###  eat as much as appetizers you can because what comes after is disgusting  ###  after having had all the appetizers we thought that some bad guys wrote some bad review about this restaurant  ###  so we were eager to have our main dish  ###  i had the lamb  ###  it was just bones and fat  ###  when i managed to find a little meat and tasted it , i nearly throw up  ###  it tasted between sand and coal  ###  i think the bbq grill was never cleaned in many months or years  ###  my wife had the mixed grill  ###  the shrimps were just eatable  ###  the steak was poor quality  ###  fortunately there was some chicken but tasted very bad  ###  i was so upset that i nearly jumped onto the head waiter  ###  my wife told me you waste your time  ###  italian (5/5) nice restaurant good ambiance  ###  good main dishes  ###  a lot of food selection  ###  meals have the right size  ###  do not miss their soup  ###  gourmet (4/5) beautiful place  ###  you have to choose to have either salad or soup  ###  i complained that it is ridiculous and they gave me a free soup  ###  soups are delicious  ###  i have tasted 3 of them  ###  main dishes are a little small  ###  if you have the chance to go several times to this restaurant taste different dishes  ###  
79	beautiful resort but do not visit during the peak season  ###  the resort is both beautiful and large  ###  there are several lounge areas and two pool bars  ###  one of the pool bars is in the vip ( royal service area )  ###  check - in was a bit of a pain since the lobby isn?? enclosed , so it?? not air conditioned  ###  certain parts of the dominican airport are not air conditioned so standing in a hot lobby behind several other couples waiting to check in is less than comfortable  ###  express check in and check out is available to royal service members only  ###  we were told to leave our baggage at the front lobby and the bell boys would bring it to the room  ###  this was a completely foreign concept to me , but it was nice not having to lug around our heavy bags , and once we actually walked the grounds and located our room , i understood why they bring you your bags to your room  ###  you will waste a lot of time walking the resort , or waste a lot of time on the train , which makes multiple stops  ###  the other option is to flag down a golf cart and tip the driver for a ride , but this is not always easy to do  ###  reservations : we visited the resort during the peak season , so making dinner reservations was a complete joke  ###  you couldn?? call before 9 a  ###  when we did , the line was busy  ###  we would get through around 9:30am , only to be told that there was no open spots anywhere in their 11 restaurants  ###  you are not allowed to make a reservation more than 2 days in advance , unless you are royal service , and then you can make your reservations a week out  ###  if you don?? manage to get dinner reservations , you must eat dinner off - site at the mall next door , unless you are royal service member  ###  then you can at least eat at the buffet that is open until 11p  ###  my biggest complaint in addition to the difficulty of making reservations is the fact that even if you do get a reservation , you must call back after 2pm to confirm again , and that still doesn?? guarantee your time  ###  our reservations were pushed back several times without the staff telling us in advance  ###  so , we had to stop what we were doing in order to make our dinner time , and when we get there , we are told our time is not 8:15pm , but has been moved to 9:30pm  ###  guest service is less than helpful , unless you are member of royal service  ###  food : the buffet food was okay but i had a hard time finding healthy dishes  ###  even the vegetables are cooked in oil or butter , and the salads are doused in dressing or oil  ###  a person gets sick of eating fruit everyday  ###  dinner was either just okay or excellent  ###  it probably depends on what you order , and who?? working in the kitchen on any given night  ###  as for tipping , the money that we saved booking this vacation could have been pilfered away with all the tipping you??e expected to do  ###  after you pay your $10 at the airport , you may have to visit the bathrooms  ###  i shocked to see a bathroom attendant who wanted to be tipped for handing me a paper towel  ###  i??l get my own damn paper towel  ###  then you are faced with either fighting off the guys who want to be tipped for getting your bags for you  ###  you will be expected to tip your bus driver who brings you to the resort , and the bell boys who bring your bags to the room  ###  you can tip the bartenders but i don?? think it made a difference either way  ###  we never had to wait too long for a drink anyway  ###  besides , there are enough bars in the place that if the wait is too long at one , you can walk a short distance to another lounge where there is less of a wait  ###  we didn?? tip the bartenders most of the time , nor the waiters , unless the service was extremely good  ###  tipping the maid service doesn?? seem to help one way or the other  ###  i didn?? notice if the room was cleaned earlier because of it , and we didn?? receive anything extra in the mini fridge  ###  at one point , i actually had to leave the maid a note to refill the coffee  ###  what you read about the absence of washcloths is true , unless you are royal service  ###  read on for more details of what the royal service is actually all about , and then you can decide whether the $70 in free resort money is worth about 2 hours of your time  ###  the beach is stunning and clean  ###  though if you walk past the resort a ways toward the gift shops , you will notice how dirty the shore looks , because this is the area where the locals hang  ###  people that run the gift shops will approach you and ask you to visit their shops where they promise a ??ood price?  ###  you can manage a bargain , but the haggling takes patience  ###  we took an excursion to santo domingo  ###  i would wholeheartedly not recommend this excursion  ###  the 3 hour drive ended up being 5  ###  5 hours each way , and total was just under 15 hours  ###  the advertised time says it is a 12 hour excursion  ###  apparently , that?? 12 hours dominican time  ###  the first stop was a hole in the ground , known as the three eyes  ###  it is a cave , in which an earthquake created 3 lakes within  ###  we drove by the christopher columbus lighthouse but were unable to go inside  ###  you could only take photos  ###  we stopped by a sugar cane statue , and took a few more photos  ###  lunch was decent  ###  then onto the house of diego , the son of christopher columbus , where we able to go inside and take a tour  ###  from there , we visited the cathedral , which is not air conditioned  ###  we walked right by 2 museums and the hard rock caf? , and were instead dropped in front of a tourist trap , a  ###  , colonial market  ###  you are given 45 minutes to make your purchases  ###  the prices are beyond ridiculous : $9 usd for a shot glass , $15 usd for an ashtray , etc  ###  the prices are also non negotiable , but you get a 20% discount off most things because of the tour operator  ###  still , the prices are no bargain  ###  i was disappointed that we were unable to go off on our own for a bit , and were unable to haggle with the local vendors for some good bargains  ###  going to and from , you see poverty and the third world country that is the dominican republic  ###  the tour operator never mentioned it , but i think it would have been worth mentioning  ###  overall , the impression i took away from the dominican republic is that they don?? really preserve their history , and don?? take pride in their country  ###  we took a snorkeling excursion via scuba caribe , which seems to work with the hotel  ###  it is an hour and a half , and $29 per person booked via viator  ###  you are taken out on a glass bottom boat to the coral reef , where you can happily snorkel for an hour  ###  royal service : you will be approached from the moment you walk into the hotel about making an appointment for this  ###  my husband and me finally agreed , just so they would stop hassling us about it  ###  they tell you that the royal service is not a timeshare , because there are no black out dates  ###  options that are not used one year will roll over to another year  ###  there are over 350 hotels and resorts to use the options with , and you can even use your masgold points to pay for airfare  ###  the royal service rooms are equipped with a kitchen/kitchenette with granite countertops , and refrigerator comes stocked with drinks  ###  
79	very enjoyable vacation the reviewers : bob , 58, and sharon , 48, american , well traveled in the caribbean , mexico , costa rica , asia - pac  ###  adventurous souls interested in new experiences , cultures , food , fishing , boating  ###  appreciate the lap of luxury , but equally excited roughing it in fly - in camps in northern ontario or tiny fishing villages on mexico?? pacific coast  ###  extremely limited grasp of the spanish language , but willing to make an effort  ###  arrival , departure , and transfers , punta cana airport / excellence : among the easiest we??e ever experienced  ###  breezed through customs on arrival , $10 visa fee apiece , porters aggressive but manageable  ###  contacted the resort in advance to arrange a taxi , driver was waiting with a sign  ###  seventy five minutes , sixty bucks and a ten dollar tip later arrived at excellence  ###  the drive nothing to worry about , slaloming through the potholes , application of the horn as an occasional navigational aid , all fairly standard in our experience  ###  you never really get going all that fast  ###  certainly less of an adventure than using a twenty to motivate a nyc cabbie to get you to jfk in time for your flight  ###  departure at the airport was similar , waved right on through  ###  no requests for any sort of exit fee  ###  got to the pc airport two hours early to allow for whatever we figured we had to allow for , sat at the gate and cooled our heels for an hour and a half before boarding for home  ###  way easier than the typical confusion in , for example , mexico city  ###  first impressions and check in : the initial impression of the place suggests ??nderstated elegance?  ###  not a lot of screaming opulence or showy heel - clicking , but the large , open lobby and manicured grounds clearly exude quality and the staff appear committed to customer service  ###  the guy who unloaded our duffels couldn?? find our name on his list of the day?? check - in?? ( i had confirmed our room a couple weeks earlier ) , but left us with the impression that it wasn?? a problem  ###  and yes , they give you a little flute of champagne  ###  at the front desk , we produced our credentials and the staffer disappeared momentarily , then reappeared , saying , ??lease step into my office  ###  whereupon we slid down to a more private area of the front desk  ###  we were then informed that the staffer was hoping to ??pgrade us to a higher quality room?  ###  and hinted that , if we were so inclined , he might be able to ??xtend us this courtesy?  ###  i replied that i was sure we could work something out  ###  he disappeared again  ###  not being ??oom?  ###  we had booked the el cheapo garden view room , and at this point it was obvious to me that they?? given all of those away  ###  we were going to be upgraded , and our friend at the desk was hoping to make something off the deal  ###  he returned , saying , ?? am going to do something nice for you , and perhaps you can do something nice for me  ###  he went on to explain that we would be in one of the walk - out pool - front rooms  ###  i appreciated the entrepreneurial spirit , and had anticipated it , folding a twenty into my hand  ###  i smiled , palmed him the bill , and everyone was happy  ###  no one explained the excellence club program or tried to encourage us to sign up , fine because we?? decided that wasn?? for us  ###  we fell in behind the bellman and headed for our casa  ###  the room : we landed in 6001, which turned out to be the closest walk - out to the swim - up bar , an obvious advantage  ###  the bellman gave us the rundown , explained how to use the safe , graciously accepted his tip  ###  the room and its furnishings looked recently updated , and indeed during the course of the week we saw new cabinetry that matched ours being moved into several rooms  ###  we checked out all the equipment to make sure everything was working , the only flaw being that the screen on the sliding door was too short for the opening and would fall off unless closed all the way  ###  no problem , we unpacked  ###  everything was clean and in order , the room spacious , the shower had great pressure and volume , two - person jetted tub separating bed and vanity area  ###  vanity had a single sink , a double would have been more convenient , but since we were never in a hurry no big deal  ###  the bed was about what we have come to expect in mexico , meaning beyond firm to hard , but manageable  ###  being off of a corner of the pool , the room had a slightly larger than average grassy area beyond the small patio , which included two comfortable chairs and a table  ###  like other pool - fronts , we had a hammock  ###  despite it?? proximity to the swim - up bar , the room was not noisy at the times we were there , and since that bar closes at 6 p  ###  , no problems in the evening  ###  the location is close to the central hub of activity surrounding the lobby , so very convenient  ###  a bit of a walk to the beach , but nothing important  ###  the grounds : beautifully landscaped , impeccably maintained  ###  the larger pool meanders over most of the length of the resort , between the buildings and the beach , it?? unique and beautiful  ###  there are only a couple places where bridges cross , so it takes a bit of orientation to figure out your shortest route to get from point a to b  ###  pool and ocean water temperature seem pretty similar , i?? guess around 80  ###  lots of lounges , beds , and floats , all in good condition  ###  never had a problem establishing a beach head  ###  other than the swim up bar after we?? finished up at the beach , we didn?? use the pool  ###  adjacent to the drive coming in there is a small ecological park with gardens and a jogging track  ###  this is worth a walk through , as the gardens are quite nice and you will find peacocks , wild turkeys , chickens , parrots , and all manor of bird life hanging out there  ###  during our entire stay , we saw but a single mosquito  ###  the beach : the beach is long , wide , and you won?? find a scrap of trash  ###  numerous palapas to duck under during the one or two minute sprinkles that occurred on a few days  ###  lots of beds and lounge chairs  ###  some have described the sand as darker than the whiter caribbean beaches  ###  yes , it is slightly darker , but pure and without rocks , shells , or other debris , a joy to walk in  ###  because of the resort?? remote location , you can trek as far as you wish in either direction without encountering another resort  ###  there were significant breakers each day , fun to swim in if you like that sort of thing , which i do  ###  in addition to the tidal surf , the wind was up each day , so there was a lot of wind - driven waves as well  ###  i didn?? find any rocks or debris in the water , just a nice sandy bottom  ###  the best rips for body surfing or boarding were at the right edge of the property ( as you are facing the ocean )  ###  i did not find the water threatening , and there were always a couple guards on duty , whistling in those who were thought to be too far out  ###  the low - rise architecture of the resort , together with the palms in front , makes the resort almost non - existent when you are on the beach , adding to the beach experience  ###  exiting the property on the beach , both right and left , you will find a few vendors who will try to hawk you into there little shacks , but certainly no more aggressive than mexico , they will take no for an answer  ###  for those to whom such things matter , topless women were frequently in evidence  ###  the facilities , activities and entertainment : other than excursions , we spent most of our days on the beach , thus did not do things like tennis , horseback riding , pool games , etc  ###  saw some of that going on , and the staff appeared to work hard to encourage participation and make sure those engaged were having fun  ###  the bars we frequented were kafe caf? ( at the pool ) , martini ( off the lobby ) , swim up , and the long bar which runs adjacent to the theater area  ###  the theater area , where the evening shows take place , is pretty neat , with comfortable couches provided to watch the entertainment  ###  all the bars had a nice ambience , and were good places to chat up other guests or the bartenders  ###  service was prompt and selection was very good  ###  no , you won?? find single malt scotch , but the johnnie walker , bombay sapphire , jack daniels , absolut , several cognacs , etc  ###  
79	this resort explained there is a lot to learn about this place before you go , and i would really like to explain this as best i can  ###  most important of all to make absolutely clear to anyone looking at a brochure - the gran bahia punta cana  gran bahia bavaro is one and the same hotel , it also now includes the gbp ( gran bahia principe ) premier and the new gbp ambar ( new adults only hotel adjacent ) all in the same complex  ###  so if you look for a certain size of hotel from the brochure be very careful as you need to add up the following  ###  gbp punta cana 708 junior suites , gbp bavaro 540 junior suites , gbp amber 528 rooms and 188 premier  ###  therefore , you need to understand that you are going to a resort with approximately 1,900 guest rooms , the different names are in effect different receptions in the same resort  ###  when you arrive , you will be aiming for one of these receptions depending where you have booked - our booking said bavaro  ###  you drive into the complex and follow the road to a roundabout - one side is the gbp punta cana , the other , the gbp bavaro  ###  the front of the hotel is therefore effectively symmetrical - one reception each side , then one buffet restaurant each side , one japanese restaurant each side and one gourmet restaurant each side - if you can imagine the kitchen would run down the spine between both sides of the restaurants culminating with the theatre that sits between both sides  ###  this then leads out into the grounds housing all the villas , pools , restaurants and public areas all the way down to the beach  ###  we got dropped off at bavaro and after queuing up , were told that our booking was in punta cana - even though our paperwork said otherwise  ###  never mind , we waited for a bell boy to come along in a little bus that took us round to punta cana reception and queued again  ###  when i enquired if our room had two double beds instead of one king double ( we were with 2 children ) they realised it did not  ###  to their credit they changed us immediately and gave us our key , a green wrist band and a map  ###  we got back onto a bus with another bell boy and took us to villa block 28 on the second floor ( each villa has 3 floors only - dominican law states that no building can be built higher than the king palm tree which is good ) our room was more than adequate - clean , roomy , two double beds , table  ###  sofa bed , bathroom with whirlpool bath and shower  ###  only downside was it smelt of cigarettes , but not bad enough that it was unbearable  ###  wristbandscoming from the uk , i believe i am right when i say that none of our tour operators get involved with offering the different levels of clubs at this resort  ###  diamond club , premier club and hacienda club  ###  even after being to this resort , i am still unclear what each gives you - it certainly was not explained or offered at check in  ###  what is clear is that different colour wristbands give differing privileges around the resort  ###  with our green one , we could only eat in the punta cana side buffet restaurants and not any of the a la carte at lunchtimes , i  ###  but not a problem at all  ###  foodyou are only supposed to be allowed to book 3 a l carte restaurants per week  ###  with a few dollars , you could book more if you wanted  ###  the buffet restaurants are beautiful and immaculate , they really are quite special dining rooms  ###  there is a very wide spread of food , good choices and grill chefs to cook to order  ###  however , we did find like many other reviewers that by and large the experience was seemingly unnecessarily spoilt by the food being lukewarm sometimes even cold  ###  even when they brought out fresh trays they could still be cold - this was really quite mysterious and something they must sort out  ###  they have the following a la carte restaurants - brazilian , bbq , steak house , mexican , gourmet , japanese , mediterranean , fish  ###  we ate in all of them and had mixed experiences throughout  ###  this was either due to poor service one night good the next , cold food one night great cooking the next - this was the overall experience and very frustrating  ###  the worst was the japanese  ###  the 5 course set meal was sushi , then cold tempura , then miso soup and then prawns , fish , beef  chicken with rice cooked on the hibachi grill followed by dessert at a neighbouring table  ###  the grill chef began to cook our main meal as we were eating the sushi  ###  when we were ready to eat the main 30 minutes later he had managed to murder all the food as it was waiting on the grill or it was cold on platesit  ###  i really do not think i 've ever been so cross in a restaurant ( i did not complain to him as it would not have changed anything ) we witnessed someone ruin perfectly good ingredients in front of our eyes and spoilt what should or could have been a very good meal - benihanas it was not  ###  drinks were always very slow in coming at meal times - except water - and the white wine is undrinkable - really  ###  we ordered a la carte chilean sauvignon which was about ?8 a bottle and worth the money - you would not drink rubbish wine at home so why when you 're on holiday regardless if its included  ###  pools  beachwe stayed by the two middle pools as they were quieter and more relaxing - easily got beds and umbrellas  ###  the pool adjacent to the beach was mobbed  ###  the beach was beautiful but again , during the day it looked like the d - day landings it was so busy  ###  swim up pool bars were great although the resort seemed to be packed with adults from canada who even though they were in their forties or above were so loud and raucous later in the day it was difficult to get near the bar , certainly not with children  ###  they all bring their own mugs ( which obviously manage to hold more beer than the plastic cups on offer ) and one even fell asleep on the bar at 4pm for over an hour having been there since about 10  ###  i found myself being embarrassed for them  ###  there were so many it should be renamed punta canada  ###  ( i used to think americans were loud , but the canadians are right up there  ###  - )entertainmentevening entertainment in the theatre was ok although i got fed up drinking drinks out of plastic cups  ###  understandable for around the pool , but why in the evening in the theatre  ###  only the reception bar had glasses  ###  lots of dance shows primarily but the children liked it all  ###  later on in the principe square out front , there is a karaoke bar , small casino , burger joint , disco and outside seating and a band  ###  only went once but was ok , great for younger people and night owls  ###  tripslots of trips to do  ###  we went on the caribbean festival which was fun on a boat and the snorkelling and swimming with sharks  stingrays  ###  a truly great trip , and fabulous fun , with dancing and entertainment on the boat  ###  a very professionally run trip , on a beautiful new catamaran with top facilities  ###  ( did not do anymore as we transferred to cayo levantodo - see below ) overallfacilities were great , public areas were immaculate and staff were very friendly  ###  but the service was very erratic and you are just as likely to have a great meal as a poor meal in any restaurant on any night  ###  subsequently , you really ca not take anyone?? review as gospel as it could change from table to table , in the same restaurant on the same night  ###  just try and be lucky  ###  for us , our conclusion was that we loved the dominican republic but this resort is just too big  ###  a beautiful place but lacks any feeling of intimacy , seclusion , exclusivity and good consistent service  ###  for people with teenagers i am sure they will love it but it?? not for us  ###  we have learnt a lot again this holiday , and even though we had a great time , we would choose a smaller resort next time  ###  the icing on the cakethe hotel had overbooked  ###  apparently , they do this often , especially this time of year  ###  they were advertising for volunteers to go to another property for a few nights  ###  as my wife wanted to see the humpback whales spawn , ( this happens every feb  march in samana bay ) and it was too far for a day trip with the kids , we decided to take up their offer of 3 nights in this area  ###  so after 3 days in punta cana , we packed , took 1 suitcase and left the others with guest services  took a 3 hour coach trip ( which was fascinating going thorugh the country and towns ) and a 30 minute catamaran to their brand new hotel on cayo levantado ( bacardi island ) suffice it to say , this was  ###  the best decision we have ever made on any holiday  ###  the hotel only has 196 bedrooms , our room over looked the bay and was enormous , the facilities are first glass , service excellent and we got to know everyone  ###  beautiful beaches , beautiful pools and restaurants and great staff  ###  i could go on for ages about this hotel , but just look it up for yourself  ###  we immediately prolonged our stay for another 2 nights  ###  they took us whale watching for free and that was fantastic watching them rise out of the water right next to you  ###  and the really unbelievable part about all of this  ###  they paid us $200 per night as we had moved  ###  so , 6 magical days later and $1000 better off , we returned for our final 6 nights back at punta cana  ###  if you are ever in gbp punta cana and you see this deal advertised take it without hesitation and you will email me to thank me for the advice ?  ###  
79	i read the reviews on this resort after booking our trip  ###  we had concerns about the negative reviews , but realize you ca not please all of the people all of the time , and so we decided to go open minded  ###  considering what this trip cost i suppose it is good value for money , however , we understand there is a price for good service and are willing to pay for it , and therefore , would not return here  ###  there are 7 al - a - carte restaurants at this resort - wonderful  ###  we will be able to eat at a different one every night ,  ###  uh uh ,  ###  we were only able to eat at 3, which were the least popular ones at the least popular time of day (6:00 p  ###  and they were only 1/4 full  ###  as mentioned by other reviewers one must make a reservation , either that day beginning at 8 a  ###  or the previous evening beginning at 9:00 p  ###  i thought these complainers were probably just too disorganized to call at the appropriate times  ###  if we called first thing in the morning everything was booked but they suggested calling back @ 4:00 p  ###  - maybe something would be available then (  ###  ) that is how we obtained the reservations we got , but there was never any choice  ###  o , i thought , ok , we have to be quicker on the draw and thus tried calling @ 9:00 p  ###  the phone rang busy , busy , busy until i got through @ 9:30 p  ###  everything is booked the next night we tried again on automatic redial , hooray  ###  i got through 10 minutes earlier @ 9:20 p  ###  only to hear everything is booked  ###  what does it take to get a reservation  ###  lady , there are a lot of people at this resort , we have been answering the phones for 20 minutes solid  ###  my husband spoke to someone at guest services about this problem , to no avail  ###  we found this was causing us stress  ###  as this was supposed to be a vacation to unwind we gave up and resorted to eating at the buffets  ###  beware , there is a pecking order at this resort  ###  we found out talking to various guests that they block off seats in the restaurants for  ###  first of all the royal service guests , secondly , the condo owners , thirdly the potential condo buyers , and lastly if there are any seats left , they are up for grabs by the poor plebs like us  ###  i have addressed some of the other concerns mentioned by previous reviewers : check in : at the best it is slooow  ###  it was disastrous  ###  there were only 2 other groups of people in front of us checking in but it took almost an hour for the procedure  ###  the employees behind the desk stare at a computer screen without any communication with the patrons and click : stare and click , stare and click  ###  you get the picture  ###  finally we secure a key to our room  ###  we relinquished our bags to the bellboy and carry our carry on bags , as they hold our valuables , computer etc  ###  they are heavy  ###  it is dark  ###  it is late  ###  we are tired  ###  did i mention how big the resort is  ###  finally we find our room  ###  we walk in ,  ###  houskeeping has not been in this room since the last guests left  ###  bed unmade , dirty towels strewn about and something sticky spilled on the floor  ###  after a few superlatives were exchanged we shlepped back to the front desk  ###  the young lady who listened to our problem did not say a word to us but started the stare and click procedure all over again  ###  ( we found out a few days later she did not speak any english ) a more senior person came along - did appologize , and said he upgraded us to a better vip room ( it was exactly the same as the first room except housekeeping had visited it  ###  and that we should look him up to obtain a really nice dinner reservation  ###  why would we need his help with that 'grounds : the grounds are beautiful , lush and tropical  ###  the resort is huge  ###  for the most part we enjoyed walking around , but it is definately not the place to go for the elderly or the immobile  ###  yes , there is a train to get you around if you so choose , but , the walk from your room to the closest train station could be quite a trek  ###  walkways : the cobblestone walkways look lovely  ###  the first day i wore fairly flat sandles , after turning over on my ankle 3 times the first day i threw glamor to the wind and resorted to wearing running shoes everwhere  ###  ladies , leave your strappy high heals at home  ###  i brought a pair , but would not wear them  ###  the walkways are very slippery when wet  ###  they have signs stating this every 10 feet  ###  bugs and pests : as there had been some malaria outbreaks in this region it was a concern  ###  i think you have more chance of getting west nile virus in your own backyard at home than malaria here  ###  there is an obvious lack of insects  ###  they are kept in check  ###  the real pests are the ones selling timeshares  ###  they are unavoidable as they are set up at the entrances to the buffets and the main buildings  ###  at first we were pleasantly responding with no gracious that did not deter them enough and so we escalated to ignoring them  ###  once when we used this method we were met with a raised voice and : hey  ###  i 'm talking to you  ###  i asked you a question  ###  language : this is a spanish speaking country  ###  people complaining about the lack of english should stay home - or so i thought  ###  i would expect the maids , waiters , bus boys , most staff not to speak english  ###  however , when the majority of their guests are english speaking , you would expect a requirement for certain positions ( such as the front desk ) would be to speak english  ###  this is the hospitality industry  ###  pools : they were beautiful  ###  lots of cabanas , but people try to reserve them with towels , although there are signs everywhere asking you not to do this  ###  the tropical pool is less crowded , although this is where the kid 's centre is , so - lots of kids  ###  i happen to like kids , and so do not see this as negative  ###  great for families  ###  there seemed to be quite a discrepancy with other reviewers regarding this point  ###  i undertstand why  ###  
79	too large for personalized service  ###  terrible food , terrible service we stayed at this resort over the christmas holidays from december 21 to december 28, 2007 ?  ###  the hotel lobby was very nice and clean - check in went very smoothly with no hitches  ###  staff was polite at check in  ###  we were given a map and that was it  ###  no schedule of activities , no information on booking reservations in restaurants  ###  the extra things that you paid for as part of your package  ###  for us , thank god we had trip advisor  ###  this hotel has several sections and not all packages are not allowed to enjoy all of the amenities  ###  you just wander into a pool area and someone comes up to you and tells you to leave  ###  i saw it happen to several guests  ###  some instructions at check in can prevent this  ###  ok - good things then  ###  property - the property is quite nice  ###  landscaping is good ( not breathtaking ) and the resort is kept very clean  ###  this is a big plus given that there are almost 70 buildings at this resort , each with about 18 rooms each  ###  we did a back of the napkin calculation and came up with about 7,000 people at this resort at full occupancy over the christmas period  ###  they kept people waiting to eat on christmas dinner night and had to send folks to the upgraded premier area just to accommodate them , a real nuisance for those who actually paid for the upgrade  ###  beach - the beach and ocean are just beautiful  ###  the ocean is beautiful and very nice to swim in - no shells , no rocks - just beautiful miles of white sand  ###  this was the biggest plus on this vacation  ###  there is plenty of shade on the beach but to get a lounge chair , you had to be out there to reserve one with your towel by 8am in the morning  ###  a real downer for vacationers  ###  the beach also allowed topless so there was a lot of that  ###  rooms - the rooms were comfortable and very clean  ###  we stayed in the ambar section as an upgrade  ###  bed was average ( no westin beds here ) but comfortable  ###  air conditioner worked great  ###  bathroom was nice and clean with rain head showers  ###  lighting was terrible in the rooms  ###  i would say the rooms and furnishings are about 3 star level  ###  now for the areas needing improvement ( lots of it ) food - at about 7,000 people , the place starts to feel like a campus instead of a resort and the food takes on a cafeteria quality  ###  the food was terrible and often cold  ###  the cooks were very sloppy in preparing your meals ( e  ###  , omelettes etc )  ###  you could not trust the salads  ###  they always had lots of water at the bottom of the pan  ###  we found that the food at the beach was much much better and was at least warm  ###  we had roast chicken , burgers , and fries on most days  ###  those were the only hot items  ###  you have to love pork to enjoy the dr  ###  there is lots of it and not too bad either  ###  we wished they had more local food - maybe it would have been better prepared  ###  the cooks ( not chefs ) did not seem to have a clue  ###  if food is important on your vacation - rule out this resort  ###  that said , we did get sent over to the premier section for christmas dinner due to the overflow  ###  the food was ok there - so i guess if you pay the big bucks , you can get ok food - even if it is not great  ###  we did visit the reserved restaurants and found that they just had a set menu  ###  everything is pre - made and just brought out from the fridge to the table - cold plate and all  ###  none of the restaurants were great but the french - the gourmet was better than the others we tried  ###  there is no personalized service here  ###  you get the sense that the employees here are not happy ( or treated well ) and it comes through in the service  ###  no one really stretches themselves to provide good service  ###  they are polite but not necessarily pleasant  ###  here are some examples , when our family and friends tried to call us  ###  they were transferred around for 5-15 minutes before connecting them to our room  ###  while sleeping one night , we heard what sounded like running water  ###  it was our ceiling leaking from the floor above  ###  we called the front desk and after being transferred around at 4am because each person we spoke to said ??hat?? not my job?  ###  no one ever came to check out the leak  ###  the employees would easily tell you it 's not their job to get something done and point you to someone else who says the same  ###  i get the sense the employees are not really empowered here  ###  we were a black family traveling and we also found that we received discriminatory service from the staff , e  ###  , skipping us in line and taking the white folks behind us or having to call waiters to come and serve our table  ###  there were four of us and we all experienced this at different points of our stay  ###  apparently , there is some history with dark skinned black people in the dr  ###  there seemed to be less than 20 black people at this resort of about 7000 people ?  ###  anyway , we did not let that spoil our holiday but we will not go back there  ###  getting around the resort - you have to take a shuttle if you do not want to walk ( about 5-10 minute walk ) to get around the resort especially from the beach to the main dining areas  ###  the great thing is that once you get a hang of getting around the resort , it does not seem so huge anymore  ###  nightly shows and entertainment - they had the staged shows ( as all resorts do ) which were very very average and below  ###  they tried to put on french cabaret and other western shows e  ###  , lion king - of course - oddly interpreted  ###  this is like making dinner for a bunch of chefs since most of the guests there were europeans or americans  ###  they had a mini - circus one night , which was very good  ###  they would have been better off showing off the latin culture , which is very rich , vibrant and fun  ###  they also have a nightly live band that does a mix of imitating western ballads etc ?  ###  very poorly ?  ###  the singers were reading the words while performing ?  ###  
79	hot off the press  ###  entertainment excellente wow  ###  we had a wonderful time at this resort  ###  we went for our honeymoon and we could not have asked for a better place  ###  first , my husband will write a review on what he thought about this resort and i will then continue  ###  airport transfers : we booked this trip through honeymoons inc  ###  which is also travel impressions  ###  our agent liann , gave us all the information we needed prior to travel which included all the little tid bits of getting in and out of the country without problems  ###  upon arrival it will cost you $10  ###  00 per person to enter the country  ###  you will get a tourism card for it  ###  ten seconds later they will take it from you and you 're in  ###  it 's probably the quickest $10  ###  00 you will ever spend  ###  after that , you pick up your luggage and head to the exit where the baggage handelers have you blocked in  ###  i was going to carry my own bags until i saw the barricade of handelers  ###  so i gave the guy a buck and he lead me to the shuttle bus guy who then directed us to our bus  ###  they have one guy with a clip board outside the exit who has names and shuttle bus information  ###  you can bypass the handelers if you want , you just need to find the guy with the clip board and he will direct you to your bus  ###  we were then transferred to secrets by vip transportation and i was impressed  ###  pachi pachi was a respectfull driver and he kept his van spotless  ###  we never stopped , which was nice  ###  in jamaica our transfer stopped at their families beer and gift shop where the prices were very high  ###  i have heard this happens in punta cana sometimes , but not with vip  ###  the ride is a bit rough , scary at times , but remember its the dom  ###  upon arrival to secrets i was very impressed  ###  the resort is awesome , beautiful , clean , perfect gardens , etc  ###  now i will finish the review  ###  check in and rooms : i was told prior to our trip here that the resort had some construction going on around towers 11 and 12  ###  well , when we went to the front desk to receive our room keys , the receptionist ( laura ) booked us in room 11108 ( which is located in tower 11)  ###  i told my husband about what i read on trip advisor and that this room might become a problem for us  ###  well laura , whom is wonderful by the way , advised us that she was unable to move us to a different room at this time because they were all booked up  ###  but , she told us to come see her later the next day and she will she what she can do  ###  well , we did and we got upgraded to a master suite in tower 5  ###  my husband put about $2  ###  00 in the fridge and left a note for the gentleman that he would love to have some budweiser and some brugal ( dominican rum )  ###  to our surprise , that guy kept our bar stocked with that stuff everyday  ###  he was fabulous  ###  some other pointers to keep in mind : keep your air conditioner on - -if not , the floor will start sweating  ###  put all your used or dirty towels in a pile together on the floor - - - the maid really does appreciate that  ###  leave your maid $1  ###  00 everyday - -she will love you forever  ###  your ironing board and iron are located behind the curtains - - - we could not find them at first  ###  read your book about the resort that they put in your room - -useful tips  ###  the rooms may have a slight mildew smell - -but keep in mind - - - you are in the tropics - - - this happens  ###  food , bars , and service : let 's face it , the room service food is not that great , but it 's room service and it is what it is - - - desperation food  ###  if you are starving , then it is definately edible  ###  there are so many other places to eat on the resort that you should not even have to order in room service  ###  also , it takes aobut 50 minutes to get the food  ###  two good places to eat during the day was at the world cafe ( buffet ) or on the beach ( the entertainment staff would barbecue or make fajitas everyday )  ###  my husband said that the food was heavily salted  ###  now , i love salt so for me it was not that bad  ###  but , i did try some of his beans one day and ugghhh - - - salty  ###  but hey - -try something else  ###  it is an all inclusive resort  ###  alot of people have complained about the food but what they fail to realize is that this resort has so many other options  ###  i am a super picky eater and i found something that i absolutely loved everyday  ###  you can drink the water at the resturaunts  ###  they filter all their water and even their ice  ###  we did not have one problem with that  ###  our favorite resturaunts were both the bordeux and el patio  ###  at bordeux , get the chatuebriand ( sp  ###  ) and at el patio , definately get the creame conde  ###  it 's a bean and light cheese soup and let me tell you - - - it is to die for  ###  all the resturaunts were awesome  ###  if you are doing the homeymoon dinner for two , definately book it at seaside grill if you can  ###  to break it down a bit - - - -breakfast - good  ###  lunch - okay  ###  dinner - fabulous  ###  moving on the to bars  ###  gosh - -the bartenders here are so funny  ###  you have to stop at the bar right there by the beach and see benjamin  ###  definately my husband 's favorite guy  ###  he will tell you tons of funny jokes and he knows how to make some good , strong drinks  ###  he was great  ###  at the cascade pool bar , see vidal  ###  he 's a little quite , but he has no problem making sure that you are satified with your drink  ###  at the showtime bar ( the big long bar in the lobby ) you have to stop by and say hi to moya  ###  very personable and funny  ###  
79	not as bad as others are saying  ###  just roll with it  ###  single lady alone you take the good , you take the bad  ###  and you realize that , hey you 're on vacation  ###  not everything is going to be perfect  ###  check in was not perfect , eh  ###  and if you 're at the front of the line , you 're on your way to your room in 5 minutes , but if you 're at the back of the line , you 'll have to be patient and wait longer  ###  i waited about 15 to 20 minutes  ###  i decided to be a paranoid and an independant little snot and carry my own single duffle bag  ###  and so i got lost trying to find my room  ###  i recommend you allow the bellhop to carry your bag and lead you to your room  ###  i got lost and walked around in circles but it was my own damn fault  ###  it 's a big resort  ###  seven buildings and over 700 rooms  ###  so can we all expect quick and personal attention all the time  ###  plus , when i got to my room , finally , i looked into the little envelope the front guest gave me and there was no room keycard  ###  so i had to go all the way back to the front desk and get another one  ###  again , my own damn fault , i should have checked that i had it  ###  the food was okay  ###  being really paranoid about my health , i did not eat any vegetables or salads  ###  i just ate carbs and meat  ###  but i was full and satisfied  ###  there 's more than enough food  ###  two buffets for breakfast and dinner  ###  and then five speciality restaurants  ###  ( tip : go the the front desk  ###  there 's a sign on the desk  ###  go in the morning between 9am and 4pm to book a speciality restaurant the day of when you want to eat there  ###  ( the italin one fills up the fastest  ###  the beef is very tough  ###  but the dairy products are heaven  ###  the butter , yogurt , and cheese  ###  i do not know what they feed their cows here  ###  but their milk must be wonderful  ###  i was not sick from the food at all  ###  i just felt sick when i got home from the re - circulated air on the four hour plane ride  ###  day activities are corny and simple by the pool  ###  but the mc is cute and funny  ###  look out for spagetti  ###  a very talk and thin dominican staff guy  ###  he 's very outgoing and very funny  ###  relax and have some fun  ###  evening shows at the theatre are a must  ###  they are equally funny and corny but a good laugh  ###  the dancers are not from broadway  ###  but they 're good enough to entertain  ###  they try to lip synch to english songs rather poorly , they speak spanish after all , but at least they 're trying  ###  beach is lovely  ###  watch out for jets  ###  flying insects that look like wasps  ###  it was 30 degrees celcius everyday and only rained at night  ###  use waterproof sunblock  ###  i ca not stress that enough  ###  i burned my legs to the point of blisters  ###  the room was adequate enough  ###  i left tips ( t  ###  to ensure promptness ) and my room was always clean by 1 or 2 in the afternoon  ###  unless you 've got a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket  ###  stay away from the art vendors  ###  their prices are outrageous even if you bargain  ###  they offered me a necklace for $80 us  ###  they are extremely aggressive and annoying  ###  you can not use a calling card because the resort does not allow any toll - free numbers to be called out  ###  you can call long distance from your room , but it 's $2 us a minute ( pay at check out )  ###  there 's a bank and an atm  ###  but if you have a td canada trust card , you 're out of luck  ###  it does not work in the machine  ###  after 3 failed attempts the machine will take your card  ###  i suggest cash  ###  us dollars or dominican pesos ( you can exchange at the front desk )  ###  your on - site travel agency resort representative will have smaller bills to make tips  ###  if there 's one bad thing i can really say  ###  it 's that i was travelling alone as a single woman in her 30's  ###  and some of the male staff members were sexually agressive  ###  i lost count  ###  but i 'd say in the seven days i was there i was hit on by at least 20 men  ###  but you can take advantage of it  ###  ladies we get away with murder here  ###  you can get men to do anything for you  ###  
79	wondering what it was people liked  ###  we tend to stay in 5- star hotels whenever possible , and thought the gran bahia would be acceptable ( and this understanding that carribean hotels are not of the same quality as north american or european properties )  ###  problems were not major , but extremely flagrant considering that this property is marketed as a premium hotel with all amenities  ###  particuarly irksome was the accumulation of unpleasant things  ###  not one or two , but a countless number ( had a certain number of amenities been impressive , it would have made it easier to accept those things that were more bothersome  ###  upon arriving , we found out that a number of little things are not included ( of course , if you can afford to stay at the gran bahia , the cost is not necessarily an issue - but it is a matter of principle  ###  first , the hotel safe  ###  $31 usd per week , so there 's $62 within 2 minutes of check - in  ###  ( this is after having been charged $10 usd each to enter the dr , b/c the airport officials told everyone on our flight that the airline 's arrival forms were erroneous - it smelled like a sham , to be quite honest  ###  next among the unincluded - drinks that we consider ordinary  ###  jack daniels , tia maria , kahlua , canadian club  ###  while i can see paying for these at a 2-3 star property , it makes no sense at a 5- star hotel  ###  we 're not talking premium alcohol  ###  ( while we do not drink per se , the few libations we had were definitely on the yucky side  ###  meaning the drinks which are included - local alcohol - are far from good value for the price paid  ###  other issues , price - wise : if you lose a room key or your little plastic/rubber id bracelet , you get to pay for the luxury of receiving a new one  ###  ( need i say duh  ###  bottom line : management at this hotel comes across as incredibly cheap  ###  ( did i mention that the plastic keys they give out are really old , and need to be changed every 3-4 days or so , b/c they get demagnetized  ###  this stinginess is also apparent with things like towels , some of them being so old there are actual holes in them ( not just worn or threadbare - physical holes  ###  the hotel itself is also a disappointment  ###  a bunch of issues , in random order : 1) lobby : vast , but cold  ###  no warm colours , or anything that even hints at cozy  ###  2) furniture ( wicker chairs and other to sit in , lobby and other areas , including rooms ) : not one single such piece was comfortable  ###  thin pillows , so much so that if you sat down too quickly , your butt would hit the undercarriage ( yes , ouch  ###  just horrible ( as an aside , there was little to do on the site , so sitting in the lobby and bar area after dinner would have been an option , but seating was too uncomfortable to remain there for long periods of time  ###  3) outdoor walkways : made of painted cement , which was extremely slippery when wet ( it rained for shortish periods every so often , so we did a lot of slipping and sliding )  ###  particularly dangerous for the elderly - we saw a few cases of near - falls , etc  ###  4) grounds : no colour , mostly sparse coconut trees and smaller shrubs , all green  ###  the few flowers there were ( ordinary , not even as nice as what we plant in our gardens around the house  ###  ) were picked every day by the chamber maids , to scatter around the rooms  ###  workers would also cut the grass with weed - eaters ( whipper snippers  ###  ) , leaving numerous yellow areas where they lost control and cut the grass to the ground  ###  5) reception desk : with the exception of one or two employees , most of the workers at the reception desk were highly blase , quasi - rude  ###  ( cracking a smile would have killed them , it seemed  ###  6) pool : main swimming pool is littered ( glasses , plastic bags , etc  ###  ) and the water is too murky ( maybe not dirty , but bad enough that you see things in a haze  ###  ) there are two other smaller pools , but not large enough , and not equipped with enough chairs  ###  and , a good number of existing chairs were broken in the back , so you could not raise them to a sitting position  ###  7) specialty restaurants : while service was good , the food was more than ordinary  ###  ( i should say that the best of the bunch was a restaurant called le gourmet )  ###  we tried a total of 4, and only finished our meal in le gourmet - we barely ate in any of the others , and on one occasion , trekked off to the buffet afterwards , just to grab something before bedtime  ###  ( the food at the main buffet , in fact , was oftentimes better than that in the specialty restaurants )  ###  8) lack of wildlife ( all wildlife ) : while we knew we were not going on a safari , seeing more than 8-10 birds over a 2- week period would have been nice  ###  we saw : 2 pelicans , 3 white birds , 1 osprey , 2 parrots , a few greyish birds  ###  the site is fumigated for bugs , but this obviously chases away some of the local fauna ( the fact that there are few trees also does not help much , i 'm sure  ###  this was likely one of the most disappointing aspects of our stay , as we felt we could have been anywhere  ###  nothing on the site made it stand out , fauna - wise , as the dr  ###  ( the only roaming animals were caterpillars and on occasion , ants  ###  9) dull , dull , dull : do not go to the dr unless you wish to do nothing  ###  bird in a gilded ( and not that well - gilded , to be truthful ) cage syndrome  ###  while the hotel does put on nightly shows , they are overly geared to children  ###  ( that is the only entertainment )  ###  ( there is a casino , but that 's too funny to even describe - small building , perhaps 20 slot machines and 6 tables  ###  very shabby - looking and not a spot where one would be motivated to spend an entire evening  ###  10) shopping area : there 's a small complex attached to the hotel  ###  most of the stores offer cheap souvenirs , most of them touting the hotel name ( some overpriced , some not )  ###  while there is a wonderful jewellery store , harrisons ', which offers magnificent pieces , these are unfortunately priced at about 30% -40% above their market value  ###  ( no incentive to purchase there  ###  ) in the center of this market area are local stalls where merchants ply their wares  ###  they are - every last one of them - extremely bothersome  ###  so much so that even though you may want to shop ( particularly given that there is nothing else to do at night  ###  ) , you will leave after 2 minutes  ###  plus , there is nothing for sale that is unique in any way ( cheap bracelets , wooden statuettes that all look the same , etc  ###  11) water : you cannot drink any water from the faucet  ###  this even means you do not swallow - at all - when you brush your teeth  ###  you need to be very careful when eating , as we - as well as everyone we met - battled at least 2 days or more of intense stomach cramps and the ensuing  ###  ( it may have been either washed lettuce , ice cubes ,  ###  anyone 's guess  ###  12) food in general : while the food was not bad , everything was pretty much cooked or fried in oil ( lots and lots of oil )  ###  steaks and other meats were also fried in ( i kid you not ) about 4-5 tablespoons of oil , on a huge plaque  ###  fish was fried ( you could see the grease ) , or accompanied by a sauce  ###  while not on a diet , we were often hard - pressed to find standard fare ( ordinary food , baked , grilled , etc  ###  ) - of course , given the water/lettuce problem , salads were also out of the question  ###  ( to their credit , the food was tasty , and the variety impressive , it was just the sheet volume of grease floating around that made meals pretty difficult )  ###  we ended up eating pasta for the last 5-6 days ( it was very good , excellent sauces )  ###  aside : other excellent food items included all breads and all desserts ( variety and taste truly phenomenal )  ###  13) rooms : good and bad  ###  the good : quite large , with a sitting area ( couch and wicker table set ) and bathroom ( exceptional , particularly the tub with integrated shower behind a glass partition )  ###  
79	good trip but watch the food  ###  we just got back from our vacation last night to barcelo  ###  we booked our vacation through selloffvacations  ###  we flew out of toronto on march 3rd  ###  the flight was pretty good  ###  everything ran smoothly the only down side we had to wake up at 1 am to get to the airport by 3 am cause our flight was 6 am  ###  if you leave try to go later as this wrecks a couple of your days because you are trying to recover from the amount of sleep you lose  ###  we flew with skyservice and they were great  ###  everyone was friendly , the only downside the plane was very very squished  ###  we were in there like sardines  ###  our arrival at punta cana was very good  ###  just watch out for those bag boys  ###  they are visous  ###  they even fight with eachother to get your bags so watch out  ###  our transportation was very good we took a nice coach bus and arrived at the resort around 1 pm  ###  let me say that once you get in the dominican and drive to your resort you will be shocked  ###  the roads are awful  ###  and everyone drives fast and honks  ###  the way the people live here is very sad aswell and let me say they treat dogs here like rodents  ###  check in ran smoothly except we had to wait till 3:30 for our room which was a bummer but we got to eat lunch right away  ###  let me say it takes getting used to everything  ###  you will find your way around everywhere eventually  ###  this resort is huge but everything is easily accesible  ###  we had the prenium class and let me say this does nothing for u  ###  the only thing u get is the 4 reservations for the a la carte restaurants and you get a special braclet which i think does nothing for you  ###  everyone gets free drinks  ###  the rooms very okay , we did not get the renovated rooms but still they were okay  ###  dont worry about the musty smell , it goes away after a few days and just leave your balcony door open for a few hours a day and you will be set to go  ###  the beds were comfy and the fridge was stocked daily  ###  the maids did a very good job and we left her a little gift when we left  ###  our room was in block 6 on floor 3  ###  we were close by the pool which was nice  ###  you do have to walk a lot to get to your room just a little warning but its all good for you  ###  why not come home with a little weight gone  ###  it felt good  ###  now for the pools and the beach  ###  they were all amazing  ###  the beach was spectacular  ###  just watch out for the topless women which isnt too nice when your a women  ###  the beach was very clean and very pretty  ###  make sure you were tons of sunscreen  ###  atleast something over 30 spf  ###  i got burnt badly and let me say it wrecks your vacations  ###  i couldnt sleep sometimes during the night because i was burnt so bad  ###  you dont want to look like a lobster  ###  the pools were very nice and big didnt spend to much time in them but they were good  ###  they were very clean aswell  ###  you could always find chairs to sit in which wasnt a problem  ###  the bars were very good , remember to tip your bartender  ###  they basically live off your tips  ###  these people make a dollar an hour so be generous  ###  beware of the pina coladas  ###  they are a natural laxitive and if you want to spend your whole vacation in the washroom go ahead  ###  id limit myself to about 1 pina colada a day  ###  watch your drink limit  ###  the service here was very good but sometimes slow but that doesnt matter does it  ###  your on vacation  ###  you 've got plenty of time  ###  the people are very very friendly and always happy and singing  ###  the only thing i would recommend is you learn your basic spanish like hello and how are you things like that because the people here dont speak much english  ###  now for the food  ###  my biggest problem  ###  the food was awful , watch out for the meat , beware of the hotdogs and pasta  ###  do not and i warn do not eat the salami and cheese at the buffet this is what i got sick from  ###  i had to get sent to the hospital for a whole day because i got an infection of my stomach and intestines  ###  i warn you now get travel insurance or you are screwed  ###  i had to be put on iv for a whole day and now i am on 3 types of medication to settle my stomach  ###  it was not fun and very scary to spend a day in the hospital in a poor country like the dominican  ###  i do have to admit though they are very fast there you get everything you need  ###  they just dont speak english  ###  there is a doctor on the resort and i recommend if you get diarrea or feel ill go straight to the doctor  ###  do not wait it out for you will get even more sick trust me  ###  the doctor there is very good  ###  i just want to say just make sure what you are eating , do not eat something that you are not used to and just watch everything  ###  the a la carte restaurants were very good and very nice  ###  we only got to have the italian and the seafood restaurant for the 2 other ones were extreamly late and we had to cancel them  ###  now for the vendors  ###  beware of these people  ###  they will sell you stuff at way to high of a price  ###  
79	same time next year  ###  my wife and i stayed at excellence from sept 19 thru the 29th  ###  we were there the same week a year earlier and look forward to another visit the same time next year  ###  we had such a wonderful time last year that once booked , i worried that this year could not live up to last year  ###  i had nothing to worry about  ###  the trip from the airport is always an adventure  ###  the ride from the airport was much worse this year than it was last year  ###  hopefully they will complete the new road sometime soon  ###  upon arrival , the bellhop francisco remembered us from last year and gave us a huge welcome home  ###  we arrived at excellence just past noon  ###  check - in was easy but our room was not ready  ###  we went to toscana for lunch and by the time we were done , so was our room  ###  after a quick unpack , we were off to the ocean  ###  the beach and ocean are magnificent at excellence  ###  the water is very rough , so if you are looking for calm seas , this may not be the place for you  ###  there were plenty of chairs and towels and we had a waiter right away  ###  always good drinks from sol bar  ###  while relaxing on the beach , i saw a gentleman looking our way and thought i recognized him  ###  he came over and asked us if we were at excellence exactly one year earlier  ###  i told him we were and although we did not meet last year , we remember each other  ###  it was none other than the flip flop man  ###  you probably already read his review  ###  he and i had conversations daily about excellence and about the trip advisor  ###  he is very well traveled and quite a character  ###  after basking in the sun for about three hours , we ventured next door to walmart to see our friend jose  ###  there is a group of vendors just off the property and they are alot of fun  ###  yes they are pushy until you get to know them , but once you do , there are great deals to be had  ###  we bought some larimar and some other trinkets  ###  every day we had some mammawanna and a cuban cigar  ###  lots of fun  ###  the food last year was good but it did have an after - taste  ###  this year the food was excellent  ###  whatever made the strange taste was gone  ###  i think it was a certain type of oil that they used  ###  we constantly ran in to the head chef for the resort  ###  he even sat us at a table when the hostess was busy  ###  we gave him rave reviews on our meals  ###  we ate at the lobster house twice  ###  it is rock lobster , not maine so there is a different taste and no claws  ###  they serve the lobster with mashed potatoes  ###  i asked if they had baked potatoes and the waiter told me that they do not make baked at the lobster house but he would run next door to the the grill and get me a baked potato  ###  the staff would go out of there way at any point to make you happy  ###  sometimes there is a little language barrier , but that is half the fun trying to get what you want  ###  they always bring it with a smile  ###  another guest complained about a certain sauce that was on their meal , so i asked if they just re - ordered and got it the way they wanted  ###  they did not and were not happy with their meal  ###  the staff at excellence will bring you a dozen meals if need be  ###  if you have a problem with your meal , let them know how they can make it better and they will do whatever it takes  ###  we ate at spice three times  ###  we always had the pad tai noodles and the fried rice with every meal along with some entree  ###  very good dinners  ###  chez isabel also saw us three times  ###  the beef was amazing and we also got an order of coquelle each time  ###  we ate at the grill just once , but the beef melted in your mouth  ###  we would have gone back , but we ran out of days  ###  we ate at barcelona once  ###  it was good , but some of the other restaurants were just better  ###  we had breakfast in toscana every morning  ###  i had a fresh omlet and my wife ate mostly fruit for breakfast  ###  there was always plenty of fresh juice and champagne if you wanted a glass  ###  after dinner every night , we had drinks and listened to domingo  ###  he is an amazing sax player  ###  after domingo , the shows started  ###  it is not vegas , but some are entertaining  ###  the grounds are absolutely amazing at excellence  ###  they are constantly working and the place is beautiful  ###  the pool seems to go on forever  ###  the layout of the resort is great because it goes along the ocean , not away from it  ###  it gives the resort a tremendous amount of beach frontage  ###  because there is sooo much beach and the pool that seems to never end , you really are not all crowded together  ###  we stayed at another resort in bavaro this spring  ###  the pool was small and the buildings are built going away from the beach  ###  the people were just on top of one another  ###  i think it says alot that as we were leaving , our thought was same time next yearthere were a few minor issues  ###  there were more bugs this year and the maid service seemed to be a little inconsistant  ###  nothing that would ruin my trip or keep me from returning  ###  we even had two and a half days of rain  ###  i guess it just kept us from getting too much sun  ###  overall , our trip was great and we think a tremendous value  ###  
79	lower your expectations if you want to enjoy this resort this is a very difficult review for me to write - my aim here is solely to help those thinking about staying at this resort , in specific , or in punta cana , in general , make an informed decision and , hopefully , have a more pleasant experience  ###  ( my apologies in advance for any grammar/typos ) summary : if you are absolutely set on visiting punta cana , the majestic colonial is not a bad place to say as long as you lower your expectations - specifically , you will not be dissapointed if you expect a 2- star start hotel  ###  you will be fairly dissapointed if you expect a 3- star resort  ###  and , you will be extremely dissapointed if you 're expecting a stay in a 4- star or better resort  ###  lastly , i do not recommend you book your stay through an agency unless you receive a significantly lower price than what you would receive through the resort directly  ###  i assure you , this is a review from a real person with extensive travel experience  ###  feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions or are looking for additional helpful tips  ###  the specifics : i stayed at the majestic colonial with my wife and 8 yr old daughter from december 13th through december 24th , 2007  ###  we chose this resort based on reviews we read here  ###  initially , my wife was concerned about some of the mixed reviews we read about the resort  ###  we chose to dismiss some of the negative reviews since no resort can please everyone and since we had stayed at other all - inclusives in the past and felt our expectations were more realistic  ###  punta cana : before you consider this resort town as your destination , i strongly recommend you do some research ( you can get a free and extremely helpful tourist guide to punta cana by sending a request to cpt@codetel  ###  punta cana is a somewhat remote resort community - it is located in a very rural area that 's 3 hours away from the capital city of santo domingo and 1 hour away from the closest thing to resemble a rural city  ###  the color of the water there is magnificent , the sand is among the nicest you 'll find in the carribean  ###  the superlatives stop here - it 's that simple  ###  overall , my impression of this community is that is it still trying to define itself and still learning how to present a professional experience for the seasoned tourist  ###  though everyone is eager to help and tries to be friendly , it is difficult to find the knowledgeable and experienced help that you 'd expect to find in a supposedly major tourist destination  ###  we consistenly heard from guests at various resorts that the overall service level and food quality at puerto plata , dominica republic is vastly superior , although the beaches are not as nice  ###  similarly , having stayed at the riviera maya and and cabo san lucas ourselves , we found the overall service levels to be much superior  ###  ( i am openly very biased in favor of the mayan riviera - there 's simply considerably more to do there , the resorts are much better , service levels are superior , and the beach and water there are heavenly as well  ###  our view of the punta cana resorts was confirmed by several fellow tourists who we met while at various excursions  ###  most had stayed at the other upscale resorts in the area ( iberostar , bahia prinicipe , riu , etc  ###  ) to a tee , they all confirmed that their stay was not up to par  ###  furthermore , we had several locals ( taxi drivers , exursion coordinator who told us the majestic was the best or second best resort in the area  ###  i would come back to punta cana again , but i would probably wait at least 3 years to give the area a chance to grow and find itself  ###  making our reservation : we booked our stay through cheapcarribean  ###  in the past , we always booked directly through the resort/airline/car rantal company etc  ###  we went through cheapcarribean because the resort was sold out of units and cheapcarribean had apparently blocked some rooms  ###  in hindsight , this was a mistake  ###  cheapcarribean , as do most agencies , have very strict cancellation fees  ###  at most , you can expect to get a credit , not a refund , toward future travel thru that agency  ###  compare that to booking directly with a hotel where usually you do not get charged if you cancel up to 24 hours in advance  ###  in this case , we were very dissapointed with the resort after our first few days of stay  ###  had we booked directly through the hotel , we would 've simply found another hotel without any financial obligation  ###  because we had already paid the full fee to cheapcarribean , we did not have that luxury  ###  getting to the resort : the punta cana airport was quaint in a nice way - it is a small airport and it was built to exude carribean style with tatch roofs and open ceilings  ###  at the airport , you will be mobbed by workers who want to help you with your luggage  ###  i recommend you get one of them to help for a few $  ###  the airport is small , but , it is not necessarily well marked  ###  we had purchased transfers directly thru cheapcarribean , but did not have a clear idea where to catch the shuttle  ###  the resort : with the reviews we read , and having stayed at other all inclusives ( the riu palace cabo san lucas and cancun , the iberostar maya and barcelo maya both in the mayan riviera mexico ) we expected and paid for ( $580/night on average ) a four star or better resort  ###  we also expected a mega - resort comparable to those found in the 4- star category in the mayan riviera  ###  to say the least , we were disappointed based on this expectation  ###  ( initially , we thought our stay may be better at one of the many adjacent truly mega - resorts - but , as we found out later , this was supposedly one of the top resorts in the area  ###  when staying abroad , i tend to be fairly forgiving in many areas  ###  i know the employees generally work very hard to please everyone  ###  i know the cooks generally try to make the cleanest best food they can  ###  i know management generally try to motivate their people as best as possible  ###  when it comes to the safety of my family , i am not as forgiving  ###  this resort had several areas that were of extreme concern to me : safety : none of the roomc had peep holes or safety chains  ###  throughout our stay , we would hear someone knocking at our door and we were not able to safely make sure it was ok to open the door  ###  the hotel saw it fit to have maintenance and maid service people knock on our door as late as 10:30pm  ###  one night , we even had someone knock at our door around 3am in the morning  ###  we did not open the door then obviously  ###  i was appalled by the hotel 's lack of courtesy to afford these standard and inexpensive safety features to their guests  ###  sanitation : again , this is resort serving thousands of guests and you cannot expect hospital grade sanitation  ###  however , i found general sanitation here unacceptable  ###  flies and bugs crawling on open food bars - especially the buffet/retaurant facility close to the ocean  ###  salads and cold foods served without ice or refrigiration ( there would be ice around the food when it was first served  ###  but the ice would not be replenished after it melts  ###  not did the equipment supply any refrigiration ) before i would touch any uncooked items ( fruits , salads , etc ) i would bring my hand close to the food to check for temperature and , without exception , everything was always room temperature  ###  needless to say , i stopped consuming all salad bar , butter , milk etc period  ###  even with that , i constantly experienced mild pain in my stomach  ###  ( again , i had never had any symptoms throughout travel in mexico and the carribean ) water : you cannot drink water from the tap here - nor use it to brush your teeth  ###  you 'll have to use bottled water for that  ###  ( yes , mexico has a similar problem , but four star resorts there filter their water for you  ###  ok , get this , all doors to public restrooms are always kept open  ###  to the life of me , i just did not get this  ###  i closed the doors behind me several times when using the men 's room , and someone would re - open the door  ###  i know this cannot be a cultural thing  ###  ( my wife and i theorized this must have to do with ventilation/hvac - but were not sure )  ###  though men/women could maintain a decent amount of privacy in most public restrooms , there were some were that was impossible  ###  the urinal would be facing an open door - - - - i am sorry , but i found this simply unacceptable  ###  when we arrived , we were greeted with a gentleman who offered cold towel service and another waitress offering the majestic special non - alcoholic cocktail  ###  the lobby was beautifully appointed and was up to par with our expectations  ###  we took the gestures to be a good omen for a pleasant stay  ###  boy , were were we wrong  ###  the resort was build about two years ago  ###  to best summarize the situation there , i believe the resort was built with very poor finish quality ( open tiles , no mouldings on many doors , gaps in ceilings ) the fit an finish in many areas is simply unacceptable for a 3 or 4 star resort  ###  
79	great time , great resort , needs improvement we just came back from epc on 9-1-2008  ###  overall the resort is very nice  ###  we had a great time  ###  i felt i really did my research on this resort but i must say i was disappointed a little  ###  i will try and be fair  ###  first the ride from the airport to the resort was not a bad as i thought it would be  ###  we had a excellence driver , very courteous  ###  the roads are bad but he did a great job  ###  it took a little over a hour  ###  the resort itself is very nice  ###  they greeted us quickly and took us over to the club section as that is where we booked  ###  our room was not ready , so we went up to the club and had lunch and enjoyed ourselves  ###  check in was a breeze  ###  the bell boys are wonderful  ###  i must say i was disappointed in our room  ###  we had room 10201  ###  the view was nice and the room was ok  ###  one thing no one mentioned , that i saw , was how small the bathroom is  ###  the toilet and shower are in one small room , the shower is the smallest i have seen at any all - inclusive  ###  i was very disappointed in that  ###  yes the bed is hard , although i like hard beds , we did get a pillow top because my husband did not like it  ###  the pillow top helped  ###  we slept fine  ###  we also had more bugs in this room than any other  ###  i will not say it was infested by any means but we saw bugs daily and nightly  ###  thank goodness i turn the light on at night when going to the br because there was one on the toilet seat and i would of sat on it  ###  we had a trail of ants around the mini - bar and closet wall  ###  the ants did not appear until 2 days before check out so i did not complain , i just kept my eye on them  ###  i did not complain because our vacation was nearing the end and i did not want to waste time  ###  they were not in the bed area just the bathroom and mini bar section  ###  yes i know we are in caribbean but we never had this many bugs  ###  and we did not complain at all about seeing the critters so we did not give the hotel a chance to switch rooms in their defense  ###  we talked to several others who said they also had bugs , not infested , but more than they would like  ###  the mosquitoes were horrible  ###  really horrible , i have at least 50 bites  ###  i talked to about 25 people that also thought it was out of control  ###  and listening to other people talk it was a concern  ###  it was the topic of conversation much of the time  ###  we walked the first night on the beach and no more  ###  we sprayed ourselves and it may of helped but seemed not to  ###  one woman went to the doctors because she had so many to get medicine  ###  i never saw so many bites  ###  i must stress this because that is the main reason we will not go back  ###  again i know we are in the caribbean and you need to expect this , and yes there have been hurricanes close by and such but it really put a damper on things  ###  can the resort fix this , i am not sure but nonetheless it was a spoiler  ###  the resort sprayed daily for insects , which is another complaint  ###  the did so several times around 6-7 in the evening  ###  we were sitting at the grill having dinner and they sprayed and this fog just come towards us  ###  it was disgusting  ###  the bugs were so bad that night that we did not finish our dinner  ###  everyone at the grill went out and sprayed off , supplied by the grill , but it really did not help  ###  so i know i sound like i am complaining about the bugs , and i am , but then i am complaining about the spraying  ###  what i am saying do not spray at that time , do it much later or very early morning  ###  they sprayed in the morning around 7:30 or so  ###  i do not know how much is the resorts fault but it is a problem  ###  i think they are on the verge on losing the battle of the bugs  ###  overall the food was very good  ###  we did not like the lobster rest  ###  the whole meal did nothing for us  ###  you did not get what you ordered as appetizers and the lobster was just ok , not so good  ###  other than that we thought the food was ok  ###  we had some very good food and some just ok  ###  overall the food is good  ###  we had some great shrimp  ###  and the pizza at oregano is excellent  ###  the last two mornings for breakfast the buffet was filled with what i will call fruit flies  ###  i never saw one before our last two days but those two mornings people were not eating much  ###  even the staff commented on this  ###  so this may of been a freak thing  ###  the pools are very nice  ###  very large and nice  ###  they seem to have enough chairs and beds  ###  it is nice to have the huts over them  ###  the one day it poured we had a bed hut and we stayed in it most of the afternoon  ###  only complaint is there is a shortage of towels  ###  yes some people are towel hogs , but they know there are shortages everyday so they need to address this  ###  we took two towels apiece because if you did not you would not have the chance in the afternoon to exchange them  ###  they provide floats in the pool which is very nice and relaxing  ###  they ask you to keep them in the pool , but people hoard them , so they are in demand  ###  
79	wonderful honeymoon hotel we loved this resort  ###  we stayed 7 nights and it was perfect  ###  we payed a little extra for the excellence club  ###  check - in and check - out were in a separate club , and were much more efficient than regular check - in and check - out  ###  we were greeted on our arrival , told the concierge our name , and immediately taken to the excellence club  ###  they gave us champagne and cold washcloths , we signed one piece of paper , and were taken straight to our room  ###  we did not really use the excellence club the rest of the week  ###  as a member , you could eat breakfast there , but it was the same breakfast they served in the main restaurant  ###  we used the free internet in the club  ###  we also had a private concierge 24 hrs a day to help us with any needs  ###  he was very helpful , always gracious  ###  we got an ocean view room  ###  we did not get the honeymoon package , but we could not imagine being treated any better  ###  the housekeeper turned down our bed every day  ###  they restocked the mini bar and fridge every day  ###  we had a jacuzzi tub and separate shower , a huge king - sized bed , fresh fruit daily ( apples and pears ) , a balcony that overlooked the ocean and pool  ###  it was very comfortable and clean , beautifully decorated  ###  everything we could have asked for  ###  the two pools were amazing  ###  the large pool winds through the resort  ###  it is crossed by several bridges , surrounded by beds and chairs , has a swim up bar , and plenty of rafts to float on  ###  the waterfall pool had less people  ###  it was a good place to go to get away from everyone  ###  the only thing we did not like was that the pools close at 6pm for cleaning  ###  the resort was very quiet  ###  if you wanted , you could be a recluse for an entire week and no one would bother you  ###  room service menu was excellent , especially the desserts  ###  the three milk cake was our favorite  ###  there were also a ton of activities  ###  impossible to get bored if you are a very active person  ###  we did horseback riding , the atv ride , boogie boarding and snorkeling  ###  the all cost a little extra , but reasonable , especially compared to how much things cost in the states  ###  we did the horseback ride at sunset  ###  our guide was very gracious to take pictures of us with our camera  ###  the atv ride was two hours long  ###  we went up into the mountains , past a bunch of farmland , through one of the nearby towns , and to a beautiful cave in the middle of town  ###  it was very interesting and informative about the way dominicans actually live  ###  the majority are very poor  ###  our guide was obviously very proud of his country and often stopped on the side of the road to point out something interesting  ###  it rained on us a couple of times , but it was over in a minute or so  ###  ( it actually rained every day , for a little while in the afternoon  ###  but the rest of the day the weather was gorgeous  ###  i imagine the atv ride would be very hot and uncomfortable if you were there in the middle of summer , b/c there was almost no shade on the road  ###  boogie boarding was alot of fun  ###  the waves in october were perfect for it  ###  it was cheap too  ###  ( like $5 for one hour  ###  snorkeling was a bit of a failure  ###  be sure you do not go on a windy day  ###  the boat that takes you out is very small and more than one person got sick  ###  the reef is not in a cove , it is out in the middle of the ocean , and the water was very rough the day we went  ###  we came back early , b/c 3 out of the 6 ppl in our group were hanging over the side of the boat  ###  but i did look under the water for a minute and the reef and fish were absolutely gorgeous  ###  there were seven restaurants to pick from : italian , french , mediterranean , asian , mexican , and the lobster grill  ###  we did not visit the asian or mexican ones  ###  all of the others were fabulous  ###  the italian was our favorite  ###  the atmosphere at the french place was the most romantic  ###  the wine list was excellent at all of them  ###  the waiters were all very gracious  ###  the entree ' servings tend to be smaller than american portions , so order an appetizer  ###  ( or you can order two entrees  ###  it 's an all - inclusive  ###  ) look at the resort flyers ahead of time ( you get one in your room each day ) and plan your dinners , b/c some of the restaurants close on certain nights  ###  breakfast was amazing  ###  it was a huge buffet with everything you can imagine  ###  the smoothies are custom made to order , as well as the omelets at the omelet station  ###  there was a man playing the piano during breakfast every morning  ###  it was a beautiful way to wake up and start your day  ###  for lunch , we mostly ate at the grill  ###  everything we had there was good  ###  they offered ( for an extra fee ) a candlelit dinner for two on the beach  ###  we did not see anyone taking advantage of it the whole time we were there  ###  we did not do it b/c there were a lot of gnats on the beach at that time of the evening  ###  the beach was gorgeous  ###  prettier than anywhere in florida and way less crowded and touristy than waikiki  ###  there was no trash , no kids , no seaweed , no jellyfish , no rocks  ###  the sand was not too hot and the wind was a light breeze  ###  the water temperature was perfect in october  ###  
79	mixed bag at majestic we stayed at the majestic for 10 days late june into july  ###  we 'd had the trip booked since nov  ###  '07 to celebrate our anniversary and our first kidless vacation in 19 years  ###  the resort was pretty busy , so i?? guess they were at full capacity  ###  disclaimer : i?? a bit of a germ - a - phobe , as i have been sick on vacation before  ###  arrivalyou will have to pay for a ten dollar ??raveler?? pass?  ###  you pay for the pass , are handed the pass , then you give it right back to them  ###  it?? a little weird  ###  if you get carsick easily , take some dramamine before you get on the bus to the resort  ###  check in went smoothly but i was on guard the minute we arrived as i 'd been reading the trip advisories  ###  we had paid for an ocean front room and out of the gate , the front desk girl tried to deny this  ###  we 'd even had our travel agent confirm the week before  ###  alas , when i put my foot down and showed the paper work from our agent , she called over another girl who said the first girl had made a mistake , and of course we had an ocean front room  ###  we were escorted to our room by a porter who spoke no english , but he still could communicate what we needed to know with gestures and pointing to signs  ###  he was very pleasant  ###  our room was oceanfront in name only  ###  the view obstructed by the grass diving hut , and the other ocean front balconies that jutted out further than ours  ###  this was the third floor on the farthest side of the resort , overlooking the neighboring resort  ###  rooms at the ocean front end of the resort are subject to a terrible echo factor that reverberates through the doors to your room , which have huge gaps around them  ###  staff and guests were very noisy in the hallways , and we could hear any and everything that happened in the alcove of the ocean front hallways  ###  it is also quite a hike from oceanfront to the lobby  ###  the bathroom set up provides little privacy??f you don?? know your roommate intimately , you will by the end of your vacation  ###  : o ) the shower was great??wo heads and lots of room  ###  the patio jacuzzi took forever to fill , and it wouldn?? hold the water with a leaky drain  ###  i was very uncomfortable in our room from the get go  ###  the ac was hard wired to a supposed 20 degrees celsius  ###  i do not think it got any cooler than 78 degrees in our room  ###  i could not use the bathroom mirror to get ready , as it was so hot in that area under the lights and eons away from the ac vent ( we had a junior colonial suite )  ###  when we complained about it , we were told that the thermostats were set to go no cooler than 20, and there was not anything they could do about it  ###  therefore , it was truly disheartening to learn from another guest that his room was too cool , and his thermostat went down to 5 degrees celsius  ###  on the day before we left , we learned our neighbors had no ac at all in their room , and victor became involved  ###  they actually had to change ( very noisily ) the whole ac unit which affected more than just our neighbor?? room  ###  no wonder our room never felt cool enough  ###  and funny , after we told victor that we 'd been suffering in a too warm room , somehow our thermostat ??hat couldn?? be turned down?  ###  miraculously was reprogrammed down to 18 degrees c on our last night  ###  but it still was not any cooler  ###  the ventilation system there also needs a good cleaning  ###  of course there will be a mildew smell??t?? one of the most humid places on earth??ut an occasional cleaning of the air system would probably help the smell  ###  housekeeping was ok  ###  the bed was changed every day , but what the heck is with the open - ended pillowcases  ###  that was very annoying  ###  we squashed a roach in our room one day , and the carcass remained there on the floor until we checked out  ###  there were also little blood stains on our drapes??leaning the drapes on occasion would be nice , too  ###  we had a dvd player in our room??ut no dvd??  ###  bring some movies that you??e been meaning to watch , because there are limited tv stationsfood : enough has been said about the food , and i agree with the majority  ###  sometimes there was a delicious surprise , such as our experience at the japanese restaurant  ###  if you have a late dinner at this restaurant , i would beware  ###  get the earliest slots available (6:30)  ###  we saw raw fish and meat sitting out at 6:30 that wouldn?? be used until later?  ###  br/>and it was hot in there  ###  one guest that we met got very sick after eating the 8 pm sushi at the japanese place  ###  try their version of strawberry ( fresa ) ice cream??astes like berry bubblegum  ###  great coconut macaroons , too  ###  i was very careful not to drink the water  ###  we brushed our teeth with bottled h2o and avoided ice and poured water as much as we could  ###  i avoided all raw fruits and veggies , and most seafood  ###  i only had some minor ???  ###  on the second day , and imodium cleared it right up  ###  however , since the return flight home , i??e had ???  ###  i have to see my doctor next week  ###  clearly , the practice of sanitation is far from what is the norm here in the states  ###  one time we were seated in the buffet and the young man who seated us knocked a fork off our table??e picked it right up off the floor and put it right back on our table right in front of us  ###  the house beer , presidente , was pretty good and well chilled ( praise be  ###  )??nd we are picky beer drinkers  ###  you might want to consult with your physician before your make the trip to dr?? think bringing a general antibiotic is a good idea just in case  ###  resortthere were lots of families at the resort , which doesn?? normally bother us , but it wasn?? a very relaxing or romantic atmosphere with a ton of kids running around , crying , and parents yelling , etc  ###  we were puzzled as to why the children?? section of the pool is down by the swim up bar either way , we didn?? frequent the pool very much , as the beach was just too beautiful to miss  ###  ( note : hide your beach towels by the pool??urs was snatched and you can be charged up to $25 for missing beach towels )  ###  do bring a raft if you go to the pool  ###  the beach and the resort grounds , in my opinion , were the saving grace of the resort  ###  hint : avoid the ??end?  ###  in the beach , as the current can be a little rough there , and you??l scratch your feet on all the rock/coral??nstead , head down to the beach area by the wedding canopy right outside the official ??wimming area????here is a great place to swim in the ocean there without the hassle of the rocks under your feet  ###  the water is just beautiful??arm , clear , perfect to just walk right in  ###  the staff work very hard  ###  we saw staff who were there from sun up to beyond sun down??nd all were friendly and always greeted us  ###  we didn?? engage much with the animation team or the shows at night , but it was evident that they work their butts off  ###  we tried to see the michael jackson show the one night , got there 40 minutes early , but still got lousy seats because people were saving rows and rows of seats for their family and friends??alf that didn?? even show up  ###  some people ( guests ) were downright rude about it  ###  hint : if you see a show , don?? sit in the back section behind the main aisle  ###  
79	relaxing vacation resort  ###  my husband and i returned from our trip to excellence on september 4th  ###  we were there four nights and were overall very pleased with everything  ###  our biggest complaint was the food , but you can read more about that below  ###  this is a great resort if you just want to relax and enjoy the amenities , which is exactly what we did  ###  it?? not five star for those of you who think of four seasons and the waldorf when you think of five star , but it?? pretty good for an all inclusive  ###  transportation : ride to and from the airport was as expected  ###  it takes an hour each way and they drive a little crazy , but overall not bad  ###  check in : smooth , quick  ###  no one even asked us about upgrading or joining the excellence club , which was fine with us  ###  from what i read , it 's a waste of $  ###  room : we were in building 11  ###  our room was in good condition  ###  we had no complaints other than a dog barking every morning at around 4:30am  ###  there?? a residential community that is adjacent to the resort property , and evidently someone has a dog over there  ###  the resort was willing to move us to another room in building 4 ( way on the other side ) but we declined because we didn?? want to deal with packing everything up again  ###  they offered no other incentive for the annoyance  ###  room service and maid service were always quick  ###  no complaints there  ###  the room layout was nice , but the shower was a bit small and squeezing two people in it was out of the question  ###  this was our favorite part  ###  there are so many options for lounging  ###  there are cabana beds both on the beach and at the pool , as well as tiki huts throughout  ###  you never had to ??eserve?  ###  spot because there was always something open and clean towels everywhere for you to grab  ###  the same goes for the pool floats  ###  bar service was excellent and the staff was constantly coming around bringing drinks/snacks to us  ###  the beach area had plenty of amenities including boogie boards , ocean kayaks , snorkel equipment , etc  ###  the only downside of the beach is that it?? very ??tlantic?  ###  in nature because it?? on the atlantic side of the island  ###  therefore , we had brown sand and big waves , not white sand and crystal clear calm waters  ###  the breeze from it was really nice because it was quite hot , but it would have been nice to feel more ??aribbean?  ###  food : we??e not huge eaters , but we were really disappointed with the food  ###  the only thing five star about the food was chez isabelle , the french restaurant  ###  the others were all par for the course  ###  every night something we ordered on the menu was out of stock which was both disappointing and annoying  ###  they also randomly close a restaurant or two every night  ###  they alert you ahead of time , but it 's still a let down if you were really looking forward to a type of cuisine that day  ###  breakfast and lunch are in the same two restaurants every day with the same menus every day?  ###  the ambiance is something the resort could improve on , as many of the restaurants were not very romantic at night due to the lights being turned up way too high for a ??omantic?  ###  overall the food was not bad , but it was not that great either  ###  drinks : the drinks were great  ###  you do have to ask for the top shelf alcohol if you want it , but it?? freely flowing and available at all the bars  ###  we never felt the need to tip anyone , nor did we experience inferior service from someone as a result  ###  this was a bonus  ###  the only complaint we have about the drinks are the ??re processed?  ###  frozen drinks like a strawberry daiquiri , for example  ###  it comes out of a big machine and was made with strawberry flavored syrup ?  ###  very low quality  ###  we did find a real margarita one night at agave ( mexican restaurant ) which was a pleasant surprise  ###  during the day , however , at the bars you have to settle for the pre - mixed , sub par frozen concoctions  ###  all the other drinks are fantabulous , however  ###  shopping : the vendors at the edges of the beach are very aggressive  ###  if you??e firm with them , they??l leave you alone  ###  one night the resort hosted many vendors on the property  ###  it was fun to look their products , but again they??e very aggressive trying to get you over to their booth instead of the guy?? booth next to them  ###  ( it?? like a swarm of bees fighting over the only honey pot  ###  you must bargain with them  ###  i wanted a turquoise necklace , bracelet , and earring set  ###  the guy wanted to know how much i would pay for all three  ###  i turned the question around and asked him what he wanted  ###  he said ?  ###  i laughed out loud and offered $25  ###  i stood my ground and 60 seconds later walked away with my new jewelry for $25  ###  amenities : you must take advantage of two things at this resort : 1) the photography session ?  ###  we signed up for a 30 minute photo shoot on the beach for a mere $60  ###  the very nice french photographer took about 60 images total  ###  he printed them all out and we got to choose ten 5x7?? to keep  ###  we went ahead and paid another $40 to get a disc of all the photos so we could take them home and print them ourselves  ###  $100 for a photo session with the right to copy?  ###  good deal ( trust me , i?? a professional photographer  ###  sign up for this at the amenities desk  ###  2) the horseback riding on the beach : you sign up for this at the concierge desk  ###  they ride five days a week at 10am or 4pm  ###  it was so much fun  ###  the staff was great and they even took pictures of us with my camera  ###  they also took pictures of us with their camera , then when we were done tried to sell us a bottle of rum with our picture already on the label ( pretty cool ) for $15, but we passed since we had our own pictures on our camera  ###  total ride was about 30 minutes long  ###  we really enjoyed it  ###  
79	perfect honeymoon just got back from staying at the excellence from feb 24- mar 1  ###  booked through cheap tickets  ###  upon arriving , customs and getting backs took about 30 minutes  ###  we booked our transfer from the airport to the hotel separately  ###  we booked through dominican airport transfers  ###  after getting our bags , we walked to where tons of people holding up signs were standing  ###  we found our guy who had dominican airport transfers on his sign and he had our information with him  ###  if you do book w/ them , make sure you bring a confirmation sheet  ###  we were the only 2 people in the van all the way to the resort and all the way back to the airport when you leave  ###  they do not pick up anyone else , which could delay your trip  ###  the ride is 1 hour , with no stops  ###  we stopped once on the way , b/c our driver got us some dominican beers  ###  he was really cool  ###  they do drive crazy there  ###  do not worry about it  ###  you 've just gotta trust that they know what they 're doing and just enjoy the ride  ###  check in at the hotel was easy  ###  took about 10 minutes and we were up in our room  ###  we brought our marriage license to prove we were on our honeymoon , but they did not need to see it  ###  the honeymoon perks you get are : a breakfast in bed , a romantic dinner at any of the restaurants , and 15% off at the spa  ###  the room is nice , you get a jacuzzi and the minibar is full of soda and beer  ###  our room was cleaned everyday and the turn down service was done when we were not in the room  ###  the first night there , we ordered room service and relaxed  ###  the room service has a lot of good food , and we used it a few times  ###  they 're pretty quick depending on what time of the day you order  ###  breakfast time was the only time it took a while to get our food  ###  hanging out at the pool and beach are great  ###  there 's always someone walking around taking drink orders  ###  it takes about 10-20 minutes to get your drink , but if you want it quicker , i 'd suggest walking to the nearest bar to get it  ###  there are tons of different bars around the area  ###  you 'd only have to walk maybe a minute to find one wherever you are  ###  the pool has tons of floats  ###  the only problem around the resort , which is not the resort 's fault , is that everyone takes their towels and reserves a spot along the pool or beach for the next day  ###  this means that for the other people that do not do this , that there are no towels at all to use when you come to lay out  ###  i guess they do this at midnight or at 6 am or something  ###  we 'd come out to the pool/beach around 10am and there 's plenty of spots , but no towels b/c people take 4 or 5 of them for only 2 people  ###  this is retarded  ###  we found out that when you need a towel , the best place to look was at the smaller pool w/ the waterfall  ###  not as many people go to this pool either , and it has it 's own bar right next to it  ###  basically , when you 're on the resort , you can do as much or as little as you want  ###  there 's always a group of people playing a game like volleyball or horseshoes or whatever  ###  they give you a schedule of the day 's activities each night before  ###  the waves at the beach are not that bad  ###  just do not be an idiot and go out too far  ###  there are lifeguards that will yell at you if you go out too far  ###  you can book any expeditions you wanted to when you get to the resort  ###  there 's tons to choose from  ###  all the people to talk to about it are right near the front desk  ###  we did snorkeling one day and it was a lot of fun  ###  cost is about 78 bucks  ###  it takes about 45 minutes to drive out there b/c you have to pick up other people at other resorts  ###  you go out on this party boat and have drinks and food , snorkel around some coral reefs and then they take you to an area to snorkel w/ sharks and stingrays  ###  it 's a lot of fun , i thought  ###  it can get a little crowded depending on how many people go  ###  the other thing we did was golf  ###  the guy we talked to about golf said that there were a few courses around the resort  ###  the closest was punta blanca  ###  it 's about 30 minutes away from the excellence  ###  we did not play this one  ###  it looked to be a pretty flat course w/ not much around it  ###  he told us it 's an alright course  ###  costs about 160 bucks to play  ###  the next furthest course was white sands , i think  ###  we talked to some people that played it and said it was nice , but still under construction in some areas  ###  we ended up playing at la cana golf course  ###  it 's right near the airport , so it takes about an hour and 15 minutes to get out there  ###  the place is pretty nice  ###  they keep it in really nice condition  ###  you can have a caddy play w/ you if you want  ###  the cost is around 195 bucks  ###  they have 4 or 5 holes right along the carribean as well  ###  there 's about 10 bunkers on each hole too  ###  from what i could tell , it was one of the nicest courses around to play  ###  it did take up pretty much the whole day though  ###  if you 're looking to play golf , but want to do it quickly , i 'd just go to punta blanca  ###  they keep it in nice condition , but there 's not much to it  ###  the food was always good no matter where you went  ###  the only problem we had at a restaurant was one time when the service took forever  ###  that restaurant was agave  ###  
79	great resort except for the restaurants my wife and i stayed sept  ###  we are in our mid 20's and 30's  ###  i do not speak spanish and my wife knows just a little  ###  we 've been to the caribbean on a cruise and visited several islands , and stayed at an all inclusive in the riviera maya  ###  i read most of the reviews good and bad and thank you for those  ###  i always keep an open mind but also like to be prepared  ###  arrived at punta cana airport and purchased the $10 dollar cards , fast thru customs , avoided the bag grabbers that want a couple bucks for carrying your luggage 15 feet and went right to one of the tourist companies set up there  ###  i had only bought airfare and hotel , so i needed a taxi or a transfer to hotel  ###  there seems to be a set fee of $30 dollars per couple for a one way transfer in air conditioned mini bus  ###  so if you need a tranfer to a hotel , after customs , just go right to one of the tour companies there , i happened to go to funjet vacations  ###  bus ride was wild and fun , similar to driving in italy but with pot holes and speed bumps  ###  arrived at hotel after 40 minute ride , no wait at desk , guy spoke decent english , got a couple drinks and right to room  ###  here 's where i noticed a problem right away but still kept an open mind  ###  i had asked for a top floor room but got a second story room  ###  from other reviewers as well from past experience , noise from above can be a problem , plus tile floors echo sound  ###  now for all those that seem to complain about every little detail to the front desk and try to get a better room , well i thought about it  ###  the reviewers who did , seem to do better later  ###  i decided not to complain , i saw positives - the room was on the end of building , so only 3, not 4 neighbors and it was in the middle of the resort convenient to everything  ###  fortunetly neighbors above were fairly quiet  ###  but when furniture is moved , sounds like someone is vacuuming in your room , very loud  ###  for the room , exactly as expected , very large , jetted tub in middle of room with two sink bathroom , small toilet area and very large shower  ###  no problem with water pressure  ###  bed was comfortable for me and my wife  ###  pillows are long and thin  ###  i rolled my second one up for double support  ###  tv has variety of channels for when you get food poisoning and ca not concentrate to read  ###  mini bar always stocked every day  ###  maid came 4 days at 3 pm and 3 days at 10 am  ###  no problem with service and always pleased  ###  she even sprayed air freshener three days because in afternoon , we did get a musty smell from a/c  ###  it smelled like heavy smoke and i tended to turn the a/c off in the afternoon or make sure i was not in the room then  ###  smell sometimes came thru mid morning and late at night  ###  do not know if they have a problem with ventilation system as it may be smokers in some rooms sharing smoke with non smokers in other rooms  ###  i never noticed the smoke when it was time to eat  ###  why would i be in the room when its time to eat - food poisoning  ###  breakfast selection is excellent , lunch selection is good  ###  buffet dinner was best dinner meal we had besides gourmet  ###  steak restaurant had same food as buffet  ###  caribbean restaurant was bad except their buffet selection was ok  ###  the beef and chicken we got in our burritos and fajita 's was tough and inedible  ###  we took a couple bites and left  ###  the following day , i was stuck in my room for 2 days with no appetite and very weak  ###  luckily i did not throw up but did get diarreha ( however its spelled ) after i got my strength back and was able to eat again  ###  both my wife and i still have it but its finally getting better now that we are back in states  ###  so she ate at buffet when i did not eat  ###  we missed the fish and oriental restaurant  ###  we did manage to eat at the gourmet the last night there and that was very nice  ###  we both had chicken soup , filet mignon and chocolate cake  ###  all very good  ###  gourmet was only one we would recommend though you are only allowed one visit a week  ###  you can be carefull all you want when eating but you never know when the food will get you sick  ###  my wife and i watched carefully what we chose , ate a yogurt a day , and yet we both got sick  ###  we did see other people actually throw up at the restaurants but that was rare  ###  not much you can do but get better and enjoy the time you still have  ###  we never got sick in the riviera maya  ###  the resort : fantastic  ###  pool is long and has activities most of the time or has its quiet places  ###  bars all over the place  ###  try the cooc loco or the majestic drinks  ###  beach is very nice though swimming area is not that far into water  ###  you do have to be carefull of rocks  ###  plenty of chairs  ###  kayaks and windsurfing  ###  no pedal boats though which was disapointing  ###  more up to date people there , so fewer tops  ###  if you do not want to see breasts and - - - , do not go to the beach anywhere  ###  in other words , some of the men i saw out did the women in size  ###  so get over the sexism thing people have in america and either allow all to go topless and none at all  ###  spa was very good  ###  its good to know spanish but you can get by without it  ###  its polite to llearn a few common phrases and use them  ###  take the spanish lessons while you are there , it helps  ###  service was always very good  ###  checking out was easy , taxis are waiting at hotel and are $30 per couple  ###  at airport , you get passport stamped to leave , then switch lines to go thru security  ###  not much direction so be careful you do it in that order  ###  no a/c at airport and normal wait to get through security , so be aware  ###  drink water before security  ###  overall a very nice resort  ###  
79	ok , but not great we were told that excellence punta cana is the best of the excellence line of resorts  ###  our vacation was okay , but with some problems  ###  considering the amount of money spent i expected a much better experience  ###  i would not mind it , if it was $2k cheaper for example  ###  i will describe pros and cons and let you decide whether it 's worth the money  ###  the beach is wonderful  ###  palm trees , plenty of umbrellas  ###  the water was warm and clean , however the surf was always rough and red flags were up the entire week  ###  sand was clean , no sharp shells , no seaweed  ###  this is a huge plus  ###  it 's huge and runs most of the resort length  ###  the grounds are awesome  ###  clean , large  ###  plenty of space to walk around  ###  the weather was great  ###  constant 83f , only a couple of short showers  ###  constant breeze at the beach reduces humidity  ###  there was much less breeze at the pool and it felt hotter  ###  buffet breakfasts and lunches were good  ###  this is adults only resort and it truly was  ###  no screaming , crying kids  ###  rooms are not up to par  ###  first room had stains on the worn out furniture  ###  window drapes were torn  ###  we asked and were granted another room  ###  it was cleaner , but furniture still needed updating badly  ###  only one sink  ###  there are lots of small broken or worn out things - bathroom mirror , knobs , malfunctioning toilet , poor tv reception , ironing board with holes and burned - through fabric - all added to a very mediocre feeling  ###  we tipped left and right , but service was very mediocre and slow  ###  waiters confused orders constantly  ###  their english was poor ( i will get to this point later )  ###  nobody was rude , but they just do not know what great service is  ###  room cleaning was inconsistent from day to day  ###  room towels were too thin to absorb water  ###  beach towels were only available early in the morning  ###  they were gone by noon and never replaced  ###  there was definitely a lack of them , despite resort beeing half - full at best  ###  buffet breakfasts and lunches were actually great  ###  the dinners were very average  ###  presentation was good , but taste very unrefined and often either over - salted or bland  ###  even their own latin american specialties , like fajitas were not even close to what you get in the us chain restaurant  ###  they were clean , but  ###  constant lack of towels to dry hands and only one broken soap dispenser for 5 sinks  ###  i did not know soap dispensers were so expensive as not to afford one for each sink  ###  the resort lets vendors set up tables on premises to sell goodies  ###  vendors are way too pushy and the goods they sell are cheap crap for people with poor taste  ###  we felt constantly harassed by them and tried to avoid the central area where they stood  ###  we did not pay big bucks to be harassed by vendors on our vacation  ###  i would not mind them if they stood there and not grab your arm every time you walk by  ###  the resort caters to the world wide crowd - germans , english , belgians , spaniards , americans  ###  their knowledge of english should be better  ###  in the restaurant they could not understand a question whether a steak would be pink or bloody inside  ###  they confused orders  ###  but the worst thing was when we asked the concierge at the excellence club to put ice packs in the freezer , since we needed to transport some medications  ###  we explained several times that they need to be frozen  ###  he nodded and confirmed that he understood  ###  when the next day we retrieved them , the ice packs were soft and barely cool - they put them in the refrigerator  ###  when i confronted them all i got was yes , sir - freezer  ###  freezer - yes , sir  ###  he would repeat those words like a parrot  ###  he obviously did not know what a freezer is  ###  we got two massage treatments  ###  the service does not make you feel special  ###  the rooms are poorly decorated  ###  the massage tables are not modern  ###  the soothing music stops sometimes  ###  overall okay , but not great experience that you expect at this price  ###  ability to handle emergencies  ###  a very sad thing happened while we were there  ###  two men drowned  ###  they got sucked in by the waves - you cannot go deeper than chest - high in water  ###  there is no life guard on duty ( it 's stated clearly on the signs )  ###  there was no boat to save them  ###  one staff person tried to get to the drowning people on the boogie board  ###  by the time he got there they both drowned  ###  one got pulled out  ###  they had no motorized transport to bring him to the doctor  ###  they had to carry him on stretchers all the way to the office  ###  needless to say they could not save him  ###  
78	beautiful hotel my boyfriend , sister  her boyfriend stayed at the excellence from february 10-17 ( sunday - sunday )  ###  brace yourself for a long ( and mostly positive ) review  ###  the ride : not too bad  ###  it took us about an hour to get there from the airport - we booked private transportation with dominican airport transfers  ###  i would do so again so that we could get there quickly in a private car  ###  there was one stretch of road that was really bad , but for the most part it was okay  ###  i like the drives - you get to see more of the country you are staying in outside of the resort  ###  check - in : great  ###  we got rooms quickly ( arrived around 3:30pm ) but chose to go grab some lunch at toscana first since we had not eaten since early that morning  ###  we got a nice cool towel plus a flute of champagne on arrival  ###  the guy at the desk said welcome home  ###  which i thought was a cute touch  ###  the room : i thought the room was pretty great  ###  we were in building 3 on the 2nd floor overlooking the garden in the back  ###  jacuzzi was really nice ( they filled it up with flowers one night ) and towel art on the bed several days as well  ###  two minor complaints though - the bed was the most uncomfortable thing i have ever slept on in my life  ###  my hipbones hurt me the entire week i was there since i 'm a side - sleeper  ###  the other minor issue we had was that there were no pillowcases on the pillows and they were strewn about the bed when we arrived  ###  i 'm sure it was just because they had not been cleaned yet ( they must do lots of laundry  ###  ) but it looked a bit unkempt when we walked in the room for the first time  ###  this was only an issue because i was a little worried that the room had not been cleaned before we arrived from the previous guests  ###  after that one instance , the room always looked spotless  ###  pool  beach : the pools were all just amazing  ###  we spent most of our time at the main pool , near the far end where it was quieter  ###  we spent a couple of days near the activities section as well , but it was more crowded and hard to get chairs there  ###  the beach was breathtaking  ###  by far , the softest sand i have ever walked on  ###  the water was a bit rough , but there were people swimming  ###  i saw a jet ski ( i 'm assuming for rescue after the tragic accident a few weeks ago ) and a lifeguard  ###  lots of palapas and hammocks  ###  restaurants : we went to several of the restaurants during our stay  ###  toscana ( breakfast and lunch ) : typical all - inclusive buffet food  ###  it was average , and i could always find something to eat  ###  only drawback was the number of flies  ###  i expected it since it 's the tropics , but they were not there at night , so i 'm not sure why they were so prevalent during the day  ###  we did not get to dinner here because of the 1  ###  5 hour wait  ###  the grill ( lunch and dinner ) : lunch and dinner were great  ###  nice atmosphere overlooking the pools  ###  ricky was an outstanding waiter and made sure we got takeaway food when one of the people in our party got sick ( more on this later )  ###  the filet mignon was pretty good , imo  ###  barcelona ( dinner ) : located in the same room as toscana on the far side  ###  i really enjoyed it ( try the shrimp and the steak )  ###  chez isabelle ( dinner ) : went here our first night  ###  try the sea bass  ###  agave ( dinner ) : by far , our favorite restaurant  ###  great atmosphere , especially if you get a seat in the open air courtyard  ###  mariachi band , fantastic fajitas and margaritas  ###  all in all , the food was better than other all - inclusives i 've been to  ###  it 's not the best food i have ever eaten , but it was definitely good  ###  the only issue i have here was the wait times - the no reservations policy is nice in theory , but i question how it works when the resort is close to capacity  ###  imo - waiting for 1  ###  5-2 hours just is not acceptable even when the drinks are already paid for  ###  we went restaurant hopping a few nights just to find a place that could seat us ( whether it was 2 or 4 of us )  ###  if you went to dinner before 6:45 or after 9 you had better luck  ###  perhaps the resort needs to hire more wait staff during peak season so they can use more tables  ###  one more thing on the food - they need to get a snack bar type place so that you do not have to go in and have a sit - down lunch  ###  most days i would 've preferred grabbing a burger or sandwich , eating it quickly outside and then getting back in the sun or pool  ###  they had a couple of days where they made paella on the beach - we preferred that  ###  bars : loved cafe kafe and the sports bar  ###  julio cesar at the sports bar is just about the nicest guy ever  ###  the coco locos and miami vices were great  ###  during the day there is pool service and beach service available  ###  staff : hands - down great service  ###  all the bartenders and wait staff we encountered were phenomenal  ###  it definitely helps and it is appreciated if you speak spanish ( which i  my sister do )  ###  it 's not necessary to know the language , though  ###  plenty of english speakers to be found  ###  it was kind of like karaoke with dancing for a few of them  ###  the michael jackson show is hyped way more than it should be imo  ###  we liked the circus and magic show better  ###  miscellaneous : we did the zipline excursion and it was awesome  ###  it 's not too far from the resort ( about 30 min drive , plus another 20 to get up the mountain )  ###  i would 100% do that again  ###  i really liked the newsletter that housekeeping put in our room every evening at turn - down  ###  it helped you figure out what you wanted to do the next day  ###  we played tennis several days - you need to make reservations  ###  decent courts and racquets are available  ###  
78	a very good resort for the most part ( complete review ) our family of three ( ages 41, 38 and 10) stayed here ( club diamond area ) from march 8th to march 22nd , 2008  ###  we read all the reviews for three months before going  ###  this review is a bit long ( i noted things each day ) but should answer most of your questions  ###  our first week ( march 8-15) it was punta cana - da , since it was the ontario march break  ###  week two ( march 15 to 22) it was a nice mix of americans , canadians , brits and other europeans with a few folks from venezuela and mexico , from what i could tell of the languages being spoken  ###  the property - - yes it is big , but the shuttles run every 2 to 3 minutes  ###  the property from the highway entrance to the beach is about 1  ###  6 km (1 mile ) long  ###  the actual length of the resort from the pueblo principe ( the shopping area ) to the beach is about 800m ( half a mile )  ###  yes it is immaculately kept  ###  they are always cleaning or painting or repairing stuff or watering  ###  the grounds are immaculate  ###  no it is not confusing  ###  take 10 minutes to look at the map , orient yourself and you will be fine  ###  those who think it is complicated probably live in a town with one street  ###  this resort is actually four resorts in one : - - premier is a quaint section closest to the shopping area , spa and gym ( it 's dinky for a 1,900 room resort ) and main reception lobbies , yes lobbies  ###  but farthest from the beach  ###  - - ambar is down on the left ( when looking toward the beach ) and is adults only ( they have two separate a la carte restaurants , separate check - in and their own gym )  ###  - - bavaro is on the left hand side and includes club diamond and some gold club and the private hacienda/club diamond pool  ###  - - punta cana is on the right hand side with the all access pools  ###  the food  restaurants : - - the buffets ( on both sides , punta cana and bavaro ) in the main lobbies are standard  ###  breakfast is the best meal ( get your omelettes extra cooked , trust me ) , lunch is not bad and dinners are usually themed  ###  mexican , caribbean , international , seafood  ###  but there is always a pasta bar , kids section and flatbread pizzas  ###  there is a good selection but it is a buffet , food is hardly ever steaming hot at a buffet  ###  here 's a hint , go to the middle of the serving dishing ( lasagna , fries , prepared meats  ###  are warmest in the middle )  ###  for one week it is not repetitive , for two weeks , it 's a touch repetitive  ###  note : the buffet from 8pm on is a zoo  ###  go earlier if you want better selection and something that does not resemble your high school days  ###  - - the pool snack bar and beach snack bars are okay for midday snacks ( burgers , dogs , a pasta , nice fruits , bread section , a chicken and/or fish selection , etc  ###  buffet is good for lunch  ###  club diamond and gold club members can also do lunch at the italian , which is nice  ###  we did steak house ( twice ) , mexican , mediterranean , french and japanese for our a la cartes over the two weeks  ###  steak house and japanese were quite good , the others so so  ###  depending on the night they may rush you or service may be slow  ###  it is all a function of volume  ###  if you are hacienda , diamond or gold club , you can email public relations at the hotel in advance to get your reservations pre - booked , if not , you have to blow two hours your first full day making reservations  ###  but there are 10 restaurants to chose from ( not including the two in ambar if you are staying in this section )  ###  - - breakfast near the pool in the mornings ( restaurant or snack bars ) is okay , but not as nice as the buffet  ###  the bars are fine , but for a five star resort , you would think that premium brands ( crown royal , johnny walker etc  ###  ) would be included as opposed to extra charges  ###  animation team  shows : - - animation folks are outgoing but not aggressive in terms of beach and pool games  ###  the michael jackson show on monday nights is good , the others , so so  ###  but they try hard  ###  the theatre each night is pretty packed  ###  get there at least 30 mins before for a good seat  ###  go to the theatre bar for drinks , the service is somewhat slow  ###  lobby bar on the bavaro side has a singer/piano guy most nights who is gawd awful  ###  i wish i would have tipped him not to sing and play  ###  beach  pools : - - beach is nice buy crowded  ###  similar to stretches of the mayan in mexico or veradero in cuba  ###  hotel after hotel , people galore  ###  but it is nice white sand and a good 40 m (44 yards ) at low tide  ###  the water is warm and swimming areas never go over your head  ###  - - pools are clean ( except for beach area pool ) but can get busy like a cruise ship on a sea day at times  ###  if you put your towels down between 7 and 8am at the pools you are okay , 6:30 ish or so for prime spots under a palapas at the beach  ###  iservice : - -  ###  this is basically good in terms of serving staff , but the resort is so huge , you never get seated in the same buffet section twice , the bar staff is respectful or warm but usually not superfriendly  ###  tipping does not seem to influence service  ###  maids are quite and quick cleaners  ###  technicians ( just call front desk ) for any problems , were johnny on the spot in 5 minutes  ###  same thing for bellboys on checkout  ###  pet peeves : - - capuccino 's  ###  specifically order them hot or the cold whipped cream makes them taste like a frapuccino from starbuck 's or iced cap from tim horton 's  ###  folks who are noisy in the early am or late at night  ###  people , it 's a resort , shut up and keep your voices down when coming back up the stairs to your room  ###  apparently it 's a cultural norm for little munchkins to run all over a buffet or a la carte restaurant during dinner  ###  if you want to avoid kids at the restaurants specifically , book a time after 8pm  ###  if your boy is 10 or over , when you go to an a la carte restaurant , make him wear some pants as opposed to shorts and especially for the north americans , take off your baseball caps when eating at an indoor restaurant  ###  kids and adults alike  ###  summary : - - this is a very nice resort , but the dominican ( like cuba ) is still a third world country  ###  if you want pure five star , 100% attentive and flawless service , then please stay in your cushy europoean city , u  ###  s suburb or canadian locale  ###  minor stuff will happen hear , roll with it  ###  and remember a vacation should be like the old motto when it comes to golf  ###  your worst day on the greens is still better than your best day at the office  ###  if you have other questions re : rooms , excursions , tipping , exchange rates , bugs ( there were not any ) , just drop me a line , i will try to answer them  ###  
78	the good , the bad the ugly and everything else in between - the drive to the hotel is not very pretty  ###  punta cana is one big contruction site , it will be nice in like 10 years but right now is just not so nice  ###  there is garbage everywhere  ###  its a thrird world country but poverty is no excuse to throw garbage on the side of the roads on the green areas  ###  -the hotels is basically a gated complex once you enter it is very pretty  ###  once we arrived at the lobby we were prompted by the staff to leave our luggage by the side with the porters while we check in  ###  once you get yor room assigned then you tell the porter and then they deliver your luggage  ###  -one of our luggages was stolen/lost while being looked after it by the hotel staff  ###  we called the managers and the told us that it was probably delivered to a different guest room and that they will have the staff look at every room etc  ###  they managment said that they would carry an investigation , but nothing turned up  ###  - the luggage was either stolen or lost under the cared of the hotel staff and we/ everyone is told to leave their luggage there  ###  so you would think the hotel is responsive for this  ###  not according to them , instead we were meet with hostility and ai do not care its not our problem our our responsablity responsethe exact words of the management was  there is nothing we can do , its not our responsablityhow can that be the luggage was stolen or lost while under their care  ###  we were not offer any kind of conpensation and we had 3 kids left without clothing for a whole week  ###  we asked the manager if they would at least provide some bathing suits for the kids they said yes that they will personally deliver a set for each at the room  ###  2 days after still no bathing suits , they reason was because they were being clean  ###  since they were used bathing suits left by previous guest  ###  we were outraged  ###  and we told them we would not accept them  ###  at the end to the day we were left without our luggage with all brand new thingsand a management that would not do nothing about it  ###  there for a our wedding/blessing/honeymoon and we had spoken with the wedding department in advance , we were expecting an upgrade  ###  one that did not happen  ###  were greated as vips and given champagne at the guest services desk  ###  we were told that we where being given an upgrade and in broken english told  ###  very very nice room  ###  they room as far from nice  ###  it was like a motel room  ###  and there was rust in all the fixtures , no air conditioner , no hot waterfar from a honeymoon suite like we were promised  ###  contacted our wedding coordinator the next day , told her about the room and how we ddint get the upgrade and that our room was so discusting  ###  miss sol the coodinator told us that if we were not given the upgrade upon arrival that that was it  ###  she could not move us  ###  we were less than impress with this lack of costumer service and how the management just did not want to help  ###  the following day we meet with our thomson rep  ###  jon he was great  ###  we told him about the problem with our room and guess what  ###  he said no worries i will talk to them and you will be changed to another room  ###  we were given what we initially were promised a room with a jacuzzy and with hot water nand air con  ###  what the hotel staff could not do  ###  our holiday rep from thomson did  ###  the same problem of dirty , smelly , dated room was encountered by some our wedding party guest  ###  however they book thru expedia/ internet and they are not reps for them at the hotel so did not have anyone to defend them  ###  so for that i would recomment to go with a travel agency rather than booking thru the internet  ###  - the hotel is big and its very divided  ###  the caribe side in my opinon was nicer  ###  both the caribe and tropical have a restaurant oin from of the beach and next to their pool  ###  caribe is turey , for tropical is agora  ###  they are open restaurants by the beach  ###  they were both very dirty and there were flies everywhere all over the food al over the plates  ###  how can they even allow this to happen its a heath hazzard , many of the cooks would be wiping their sweet while cooking the food and not wash their hands  ###  right infront of us while cooking the food  ###  the flies where everywhere , they were this domes cover on the food but they have opening on the front for serving , thats how they flies would get in  ###  no food tray was left without havng flies all over it  ###  i wanted to throw up  ###  we were in building 36, right in front of the beach facing palma real hotel and the royal service beach , nice location , nice room in comparison to the first one we got but still dated and in need of tlc  ###  the beach was right next to us and also they turey grill but it was so discusting we had to take the trolly everyday to the main lobby to have some food with out it being laced with flies  ###  breakfast buffet is at the market place restaurant ( formely known as atabales )  ###  its a buffet and its been newly renovated so its very very pretty , lunch buffet is at the gondola ( its the italian rest ) but its a bit dated  ###  but we were told that is was being renovated in september  ###  the restaurants : all food : mediocre , decor : very pretty , service : they try really hard and work really hard but they were messing the orders half of the time , i just think they are not properly trainned  ###  not fault on the workers but fault on the management  ###  ( nothing was authentic ( except for the dominican one ) each have a very very limited menus , i could have gotten more variety at the buffet  ###  in fact the food is just like in the buffet just nicely plated and in smaller portions  ###  hokkaido : ( japanese ) not authentic , rather greasy , not much of a show  ###  the cheft brought everything already cutted up so it was not like a performace in the chopping and the cooking like its done in japanese restaurantshacienda : ( mexican ) not authentic  ###  the menu basically burritos and enchiladas nicely plated  ###  that is not real mexican food that is fastfood why burritos at an a la carte restaurant  ###  i have tons of mexican friends and they mexican cuisine is extensice and its certainly not just burritos and tacos  ###  american grill : basically dennis/ applebys menu  ###  burgers and fries  ###  ma maison : (french ) not french at all  ###  just basically nicely plated buffet foodpagoda : ( asian ) nothing special  ###  had the most choices in the menu but it was basically not an a la carte  ###  the menu was basically the tipical asian dishes : sweet and sour pork , egg rolls , fried dumplins etc  ###  nicely plated but were the same as in the buffet  ###  it was all assembled food  ###  to food that was created like its done in an a la cartecapri : ( seafood ) : same food like in the buffet just nicely plated  ###  i was disappointed how the litte things were not done  ###  example the mash potatoes  ###  
78	do not come here for the food  ###  my girlfriend and i stayed at the majestic from february 9th to february 16th  ###  the best way to describe this hotel is ??lose , but no cigar?  ###  at a glance , everything about the resort looks amazing  ###  however , if you take a closer look , you??l find that this place has many flaws  ###  i can deal with most of the flaws  ###  the food was by far the worst thing about this resort , followed by the not so private bathrooms , and the fact that they reserved the wrong room for us  ###  the foodbefore choosing this resort , we read all the reviews relating to the food choices and found that the reviews were mixed  ###  we got the impression that the negative reviews were a result a few snobby people who expected way too much from an all - inclusive resort  ###  on the other hand , we got the impression that the super positive reviews were the result of a few people who still consider spaghetti and pizza a foreign food  ###  we figured that the food was probably of average quality ( at least the buffet food ) ??bout on par with or just below the quality of food you would find at restaurants such as friday?? , bennigan?? , ruby tuesday , and others just like it??othing spectacular , but decent  ###  we expected the specialty restaurants to be slightly better  ###  we figured that a five star hotel should at least be able meet these food requirements??ot too much to ask??ight  ###  now i don?? consider myself a food connoisseur , but i know bad food when i taste it  ###  most of the food here is terrible , has no flavor??ust completely bland and boring  ###  so , unfortunately , i have to side with the few snobby people?? guess that makes me a food snob  ###  if food is important to you , then i would not recommend this place for you  ###  however , i?? sure some of you probably already made your reservations or think my review is flawed  ###  if that?? that case , then read my reviews below of each restaurant as a guide while at the resort??iterally , print this review and take it with you??ou??l thank me  ###  as a quick tip , the best food at the resort is at the dominican food at the mexican restaurant??o figure??he dominican?? know how to make dominican food  ###  breakfast - there is only one place to eat breakfast , which is at the main buffet building  ###  not to worry though??he breakfast is very good and always fresh  ###  the omelet stations ( more than one ) can prepare eggs of any style  ###  almost every breakfast item you can think of is available such as pancakes , french toast , waffles , crapes , sausage , bacon , pastries , awesome fruity milkshakes , an assortment of breads , and much much more  ###  the breakfast seems to accommodate all the major nationalities that attend this resort  ###  ( fyi??he dominican coffee they serve is not high quality dominican coffee??ou have to leave the resort to find good coffee??ut i like the coffee from mcdonalds better than starbucks , so what do i know )  ###  lunch - you have two options at lunch??ross and disgusting  ###  lunch is served at the main buffet building and at the restaurant near the beach called la hispaniola  ###  the lunch at the main buffet serves basically the same thing every day??lmost all of it is gross??ood enough for a dog  ###  however , sometimes they do serve dominican food , which is very good??ut it?? hard to find because they don?? label it as dominican food  ###  as for la hispaniola , don?? be confused by the name??his place does not serve any latin food  ###  they serve hamburgers on hard buns , hotdogs , and french fries  ###  on the plus side , both restaurants do have very good desserts  ###  dinner - for dinner you have eight options?  ###  most are disgusting ( option 8 is the best )  ###  option 1 ( the main buffet ) ?  ###  you guessed it??ross  ###  it was the same thing every night  ###  options 2 and 3 ( the rodeo grill steakhouse and tres carabelas ) - both are located at the la hispaniola location , which is split into the two restaurants for dinner  ###  at the steakhouse , i go the steak , which was about on par with a steak that you would find at a breakfast diner like ihop  ###  i ordered my steak as medium rare???? glad to report that it did not get me sick  ###  my girlfriend ordered the pork chops??hey were dry , tough and tasteless  ###  tres carabelas is a seafood restaurant  ###  i got the lobster and she got the shrimp  ###  both portions were very small??owever , they did offer to give us a second helping??ven though we thought this place was a little better , we declined as we were still not impressed??his was no rudy tuesday  ###  option 4 ( the french restaurant ) - we didn?? get a chance to eat there so i have no comment  ###  ( reservations required ) option 5 ( hibachi grill ) - the hibachi grill located in the asian restaurant  ###  all the food is loaded with way too much soy sauce??ike licking a salt lick  ###  the egg rolls and dumplings they serve were once frozen  ###  if you know what japanese food from a hibachi grill should taste like , then you won?? like this place  ###  on the other hand , if you??e the type that has never used chopsticks before , then you??l probably love this place  ###  ( reservations required ) option 6 ( chinese food and sushi ) - this restaurant is also located in the asian restaurant as well , but you don?? need reservations  ###  they serve fake sushi ( california rolls??o raw fish ) and chinese food  ###  we did not try the chinese food or the fake sushi  ###  options 7 and 8 ( taino caribbean restaurant ) - the featured food at this restaurant is mexican food ( option 7) ??ut take my word on this??he mexican food they serve makes taco bell seem like a gourmet restaurant  ###  option 8 is by far the best food to eat at the resort  ###  option 8 is the dominican soup and salad bar that is located inside the mexican restaurant??ut don?? be fooled , the dominican food they serve is not just soup and salad??hey serve pork , chicken , beef , goat ( just try it??ts very good ) , sweet plantains , beans and rice  ###  remember , when traveling to a different county , you should try the local food??hy??ecause that?? what the know how to cook  ###  funny story , i told some guy at the asian restaurant that only good food at the resort was the dominican soup and salad bar??e responded with these exact words ?? know?? agree with you???? one of the people that makes this whole resort possible????asically , the guy , who i think was an owner or investor , told me that that food  ###  at this resort sucks and agreed that the best food was the dominican food at the mexican restaurant  ###  the beachthe beach is gorgeous??t least if you don?? mind the occasional seaweed build up  ###  up and down the entire beach ( at all the punta cana resorts ) , seaweed drifts down the entire coast  ###  the amount of seaweed along the majestic?? stretch of the beach varied from day to day??ometimes it was hard to avoid it as it wrapped around my ankles  ###  however , it wasn?? a big deal on most days  ###  the seaweed does build up on the beach??ind of ugly , but they rake it up every few days  ###  even so , a nicer resort would remove the seaweed each morning  ###  as for the water itself , it?? crystal clear ( when calm )  ###  i?? not sure what the temperature was , but it was prefect and refreshing  ###  one caution though??f you??e bring your children , keep in mind that the water gets deep pretty fast??t was over my head about 20 to 25 feet out (7 to 8 meters )  ###  there weren?? too many rocks?? only found one area were i couldn?? avoid stepping on some rocks??hey are hard to see as they are the same color as the sand  ###  as for the beach , the sand is white and soft??ots of chairs and umbrellas  ###  however , on some days , small roots are exposed that are annoying to step on??ther days , the roots were covered by the sand??robably covered the same day the seaweed was raked off the beach  ###  other than that , the beach is generally clean??otel workers are always walking around picking up trash  ###  ( fyi , if you want an umbrella , place your towel on the chair under the umbrella before 10am??lthough some people dropped their towels at 9am and didn?? return to their spot till hours later??lease don?? be one of those people )  ###  there are plenty of activities on the beach  ###  every morning around 10:30am , an aerobics class is held on the beach  ###  keep in mind that the instructor plays the same load music every morning that can be heard from every point on the beach??ind of annoying when you are trying to relax or recover from a night of drinking??o bring your ipod to drown out the sound  ###  this lasts for about an hour  ###  
78	excellente all the way  ###  my husband  i stayed at the excellence punta cana from march 1-7, 2007  ###  warning : this is going to be a long review  ###  i am very long - winded  ###  too much to talk about  ###  this was a much anticipated vacation  ###  and leading up to the trip - i checked trip advisor every day for tips on what to pack and what to expect for our trip  ###  i simply knew that this place would be awesome seeing that there were two bad reviews out of hundreds  ###  oh well - you ca not please everyone  ###  one thing that i should 've listened to is to bring at least a 45 sunblock  ###  my skin actually could 've used about an 80 spf ( if there is such a thing  ###  we 've been back for nearly two weeks and my tan is just now setting in  ###  nothing but pain for the last two days of my trip and the past two weeks  ###  for those that want to come back with sun - kissed skin  ###  take my advise and use lots of sunscreen  ###  you might feel silly being the goofball with white lotion all over  ###  but believe me - the sun will get you bronzed no matter what you use  ###  it shined throughout our entire stay - only rained in the early evening for 10-15 minutes as we were showering for dinner  ###  my vacation was fantastic  ###  but would 've been much better had i brought a good sunscreen  ###  anyway - back to the trip  ###  when we arrived in punta cana via u  ###  we stepped off the place ( with our jackets and coats fresh from oh where it was 22 degrees ) into sunshine and at least 84 degree heat  ###  after passing through customs  ###  we had our transportation to the hotel already taken care of through our travel agency  ###  but beware of the 50 or so airport employees  ###  in the lobby waiting to carry your luggage  ###  nothing to fret about  ###  one gentleman ended up leading us in the right direction and ended up making a buck or two to carry our luggage to the van  ###  we were on our van in 15 minutes tops and waited about 5-7 minutes for another couple to load up  ###  the driver turned on the air for us and made small talk as we waited  ###  i guess i had an advantage because my husband is fluent in spanish - but the airport employees knew enough english to get by  ###  we rode in the air conditioned van for about an hour and 10 minutes until we arrived at the excellence punta cana  ###  i actually enjoyed the ride  ###  yes - it was a little bumpy at times  ###  but i 've been to guatemala and mexico  traveled pretty extensively throughout both of those places  ###  so just take it all in and enjoy the view  ###  throughout the ride  ###  you would find about 10-12 guys manually working on the roads in different spots ( improving them  ###  ) and soooo much construction everywhere  ###  this place will be like new york city in a few years if all of the new construction keeps up  ###  when we finally arrived at the excellence  ###  the gate opened up and the gardens were beautiful  ###  i was so excited to get into my suit and hit the beach  ###  as we checked in - ourselves and the other couple ( from charlotte , nc ) were greeted with glasses of champagne  ###  mine was gone in about 2 minutes  ###  matias checked us in and tried to talk us into the upgrading to the excellence club  ###  good try , though  ###  i was not paying $600 plus to upgrade to premium beverages and free internet  ###  we booked a junior gardenview suite  ###  and that 's exactly what we got ( although we did try to talk him into upgrading us to pool or ocean view )  ###  it did not work  ###  he gave us our keys and we were on our way ( to building 9)  ###  he was very friendly and outgoing , considering what happened next  ###  to make an extremely long story short  ###  we treaded past the pool view rooms to the very back of the property and up to the 3rd floor ( the elevator was not in service ) to room 9206  ###  , the view was not good at all ( a scummy pond in fact )  ###  with no fish , flowers , nada  ###  i was a little disappointed but figured we 'd make the most out of it  ###  we needed the exercise , anyway  ###  we tipped the gentleman that brought our luggage ( all the way up the stairs  ###  i might add  ###  ) by the time we arrived into our room  ###  we changed into our suits and started unpacking and getting settled in when we realized our air conditioner ( or safe ) was not working  ###  after a call down to the desk  ###  matias sent two gentleman arrived to look at the air ( did not jot down their names  ###  but they were very friendly ) - and determined that it was in fact out of service  ###  we called back down to the front desk and let them know that we needed to move to another room right away  ###  and matias let us know that he would call us right back  ###  we waited and waited  ###  and after about 30-40 minutes of just sitting and waiting  ###  my husband finally got frustrated and called the front desk back  ###  i supposed that lit a fire under their butts  ###  and they told us to go to our new room (4208) and they would have our luggage arriving over there shortly  ###  shortly in dominican republic usually means within 2-3 hours  ###  we made the walk all the way to building 4 in our suits ( although we still had not hit the pool or beach ) - and things were definitely starting to look up  ###  we passed the waterfall pool and all of the beautiful gardens , the wedding gazebo , and many friendly employees along the way ( always smiling  ###  i might add  ###  
78	not bad/great beach my husband and our friends stayed at the barcelo from 11/12 thru 11/19  ###  if you 're looking for the ritz do not go , but neither is it a flea bag hotel  ###  i cannot stress this enough  ###  remember where you are  ###  you are in a country where the people work at a slower pace and do not have the same standards as we do  ###  check in went smoothly  ###  we arrived at the hotel around 2pm  ###  there was not a line and they greeted us with drinks ( great drink , i never did find out what it was and when we asked for it at the bar they looked at us like they did not know what we were talking about )  ###  our rooms were not ready ( we were told on the way to the hotel that check in was 3pm and it was likely that our rooms would not be ready  ###  so we went to the buffett and had lunch and walked around for a bit  ###  right around 3pm we went back to check on our rooms  ###  the front desk made a few calls and we finally got our keys  ###  our rooms were adequate and clean  ###  we were in building 7  ###  again , if you expect the ritz you will be disappointed  ###  we had a king bed which i thought was pretty comfortable  ###  my husband woke up with a sore back every morning  ###  we had a nice garden view from our balcony and we had coffee on the balcony every morning  ###  our room was situated at the end of the building closest to the pool  ###  the shows are at the pool every night  ###  they did get loud  ###  it did not bother us that much as we were not in bed very early  ###  we were out on our balcony one night and it was a little annoying  ###  they stock the mini fridge everyday  ###  although they only put in 2 bottled waters  ###  we stopped at the bar everynight and got a couple extra bottles to make coffee with in the morning  ###  we did not have any trouble with the hot water  ###  although there were at least 3 times when i was showering that the water pressure dropped to the point that there was not any water coming out of the shower head  ###  i turned the faucet off and turned it back on after about 30 sec  ###  to 1 min  ###  and it was fine  ###  i do not know why it happened , but it did  ###  the food was good  ###  we ate at the mexican , italian , french , japanese and the buffett  ###  i liked the mexican restaurant the best  ###  i thought the french was the worst  ###  the food was not bad there , i guess it was not what i was expecting  ###  we only ate at the buffett twice for dinner  ###  i think it would get old after awhile  ###  the times we ate there they had a pretty big selection  ###  the buffett was best in the morning  ###  the guy making the omlettes was great  ###  best omelettes i have had in a long time  ###  if you 're looking for a big selection on a buffett the restaurant by the pool is not the place to go  ###  of course they do not have the room to lay out a big spread like in the hotel  ###  oh and do not leave your food unattended at the pool buffett  ###  a few times people filled their plates and put them on the table and left the table only to come back and find that a bird had been their eating the food  ###  the cocktails are wonderful  ###  they do not scrimp on the alcohol  ###  the banana mama 's are great  ###  the blue lagoon 's are not bad either  ###  the beach is great  ###  we did not have any problem getting a little hut on the beach everyday  ###  we went down around 9 - 9:30am every morning and there were usually plenty available  ###  watch the waves  ###  they can be pretty rough  ###  the staff was great  ###  the front desk spoke pretty good english as did most of the wait staff and bar staff  ###  we did have a communication problem with one of our waiters and a bartender but for the most part if they do not understand what you are trying to say they will call someone over who speaks a little more english  ###  it was fun trying to communicate with what spanish that i knew and for the most part the staff tries to teach you and help you if they see you are trying  ###  now to the complaints  ###  our friends seemed to have the most problems so i 'll relay what i know  ###  our friends went to their room one afternoon and their card key did not work  ###  they went to the front desk and the person at the desk reprogrammed their card  ###  after dinner that night they went back to their room their card key did not work  ###  they went back to the front desk and again the card was reprogrammed  ###  the next day i went to use my card key and it did not work  ###  i went to the front desk and they reprogrammed my card  ###  it was a minor but irritating incovenience  ###  our friends called down to the front desk our first day there and asked for two extra pillows  ###  the front desk said they would take care of it  ###  after 2 days our friends saw their maid in the hall and somehow communicated to her ( she spoke very little english ) that they needed 2 extra pillows  ###  the vendors are annoying  ###  i think the hotel lets them set up every other night  ###  the first night was fine  ###  you walked through the lobby and they were very persistent that you look at their things  ###  we looked at some and walked by others  ###  the second and third times that they were there we started looking for ways to go around them  ###  
78	room for improvement , but overall enjoyable i went to barcelo from july 28 - august 4 with a friend  ###  overall , we had a nice trip , but did run into a few snags  ###  first of all , i had made arrangements through the resort for transportation via email  ###  i was given a confirmation number and was told that there would be someone there with a sign with my name on it  ###  so after being shuffled from through about 3 different people at the gate , someone shoved us into a taxi with someone who did not speak any english at all  ###  luckily another family rode with us and the husband spoke enough spanish to confirm we were going to the right resort  ###  let me advise you , if at all possible , avoid the taxi 's  ###  that was the scariest ride of my life  ###  check in : pretty quick  ###  we did not arrive with a tour , so the line was not that long  ###  we did have to wait on our room to finish being cleaned , but we got there around 2:30, and check in was 4:00  ###  so , no complaints there  ###  room : we were put in a suite in building 7, which i was told had been recently remodeled  ###  i do not think my standards are all that high , but i was disappointed  ###  the ceiling in the bathroom was warped and sinking  ###  some of the fixtures had rust on them  ###  on wednesday , i noticed that after about 3 minutes in the shower , a foul odor that smelled like sewage was seeping up through the drain  ###  and to top things off , a middle of the night bathroom trip was interrupted by a light fixture crashing to the counter and onto the floor with glass shattering everywhere  ###  maintenance came to fix it , and the glass was not replaced , he just reattached the metal ring around the light  ###  our air condition definitely could have been colder  ###  we had it set on the lowest temperature and still could not get comfortable  ###  we also had issues with the lock on the door into the room  ###  it would not lock properly and we had to jiggle it everytime we left the room  ###  i mentioned it to the maintenance man who came to fix the light , but he just left it  ###  i later mentioned it to guest services and they were suppose to send someone up , and never did  ###  we decided on tuesday that we would just deal with it  ###  the rooms are the main problem  ###  there is definite room for improvement  ###  not exceptional , but we could always find something to eat  ###  the grill hut by the marlin was good  ###  mornings , you can have made to order omelets and in the afternoon , you have a choice of pork chops ( awesome ) , burgers or kabobs  ###  we only were able to get reservations at 2 a la cartes  ###  the pre - arranged reservations done by the resort were for late in the evening  ###  , so we ended up eating at the alcazar buffet most nights  ###  on monday we ate at tokio  ###  the food was amazing , but dress for heat  ###  there is no air condition and the heat was so bad that a girl at our table almost passed out and her family had to leave the restaurant before they could even order  ###  we had an 9:00 reservation , did not eat until almost 10:00 and not the best italian i 've eaten  ###  i ordered the lasagna and only ate a couple bites  ###  my friend ordered a pasta dish with lobster and she said it had a funny taste as well  ###  now as far as the alcazar  ###  most of the staff was nice , had a few that were rude  ###  look for hipolito  ###  he is a young man with swet personality and a great smile  ###  ( we called him smiley ) you also must check out the pasta bar  ###  it was better to me than the pasta at roma  ###  bars : best one was the lobby bar near the aphitheater and paris restaurant  ###  ask sander to make you a dominican flag  ###  best drink we had all week  ###  the bartenders at this bar were the friendliest and made the best drinks  ###  we did not go to the swim up bar because we spent all week on the beach  ###  it sounded like the people there were having a great time with some games so i 'd check it out  ###  the bar in the back of the marlin was not that good  ###  drinks were bad and bartenders at lunch were not friendly at all  ###  night time staff was much better  ###  my advice , if you want reservations at the a la cartes , get to the front desk very early  ###  we tried between 8:30 and 9:00 and most were already booked up  ###  beach : absolutely the most gorgeous i 've seen  ###  we spent everyday there  ###  i had read that it was hard to find a hut , but we never had a problem and we usually got to the beach between 8:00 and 9:00  ###  the water is so clear and the prettiest shade of blueish - green  ###  pool and grounds : very nice  ###  the guys working the towel bar were always nice and greeted you with a smile  ###  activities : a lot to choose from  ###  we went parasailing one day  ###  a definite thing to try  ###  although , for $40 usd , i would like to have been able to stay a little longer  ###  but i have no regrets  ###  we also went to the spa for facials and massages  ###  i absolutely recommend that  ###  entertainment : we did not participate in the daytime activiites , but the evening shows were enjoyable  ###  we saw an african show , an international musical/dance show , and a fever night which was a tribute to the 70's and disco  ###  the rendition of the village people singing macho man was hilarious  ###  we wanted to see the circus , but that was the night that we went to roma and missed out  ###  i suggest watching  ###  you will most likely meet a very tall guy who is involved in the entertainment named jean claudio  ###  overall , we had a nice trip  ###  for the most part , the staff was pretty friendly  ###

78	loved it stayed at this resort jan 17-24, 2008  ###  upon arrival at the punta cana airport , get ready for people asking you for tips  ###  the welcome band was kicking a bucket around for tips and a maid was in the bathroom looking for tips , etc  ###  there were various buses waiting to transport us to the resort  ###  do not get confused  ###  there are tour operator desks on your right hand side  ###  just go up to them and look for your specific tour company  ###  ours was sunquest and they will inform you which numbered bus to get on to take you to your resort  ###  the drive to the resort was about 20 minutes  ###  the bahia principe is absolutely beautiful and the grounds are well kept and amazing  ###  there are 2 identical sides to the hotel  ###  the punta cana side and the bavaro side  ###  the resort seems huge when you first arrive , but after a day , you know your way around  ###  the are trolly cars that take you from one end of the resort to the other continually from 6:00 am -3:00 am  ###  there are little bus stops everywhere , and you do not have to wait long at all  ###  we stayed on the bavaro side of the resort  ###  we paid the extra money to be a part of the diamond club  ###  glad we did  ###  private check in and check out  ###  our room was close to the semi - private pool and the italian a la carte restaurant where we enjoyed breakfast and lunch  ###  must ask for the bathrobes and slippers though  ###  i am a fussy eater and the food was amazing  ###  there were so many choices at the buffet and we enjoyed the french ( filet mignon and lobster was the best we ever tasted ) , bbq and steakhouse a la cartes  ###  we did not like the mexican restaurant  ###  just was not enough dishes to choose from  ###  ( i did not like any - but i am a fussy eater ) the service was impeccable  ###  your wine glass never went empty and the coffee is nice and strong  ###  as soon as you were done with your plate , it was whisked away  ###  the staff are pleasant and friendly  ###  most spoke english and french as well  ###  the mini - fridge in our room was not stocked with water and we were advised not to drink the water so we communicated with our cleaning lady and water was restocked everyday  ###  unfortunately , they only have the big 1 litre bottles of water , not regular bottles so buy some small bottles if you are traveling on any excursions  ###  bring your own facecloths too  ###  people were complaining about not being provided facecloths in their rooms , but we were prepared as we read the reviews on tripadvisor before leaving  ###  there is a store just off the lobby  ###  very expensive , chocolate bars and chips , $3  ###  so make sure to stock up on snacks before you arrive at the resort  ###  the lobby bar was fantastic , they mixed good drinks  ###  the pools , snack bars and beach bars were great  ###  we brought travel mugs , better than the little plastic cups that they give you  ###  the beach was extremely clean , there were always loungers available , no matter what time of day you went  ###  white sand and warm turquoise water  ###  it was lovely  ###  there is a shipwreck off shore in front of the beach , very cool  ###  the beach was usually windy  ###  parasailing is offered for $65  ###  00 each or $85  ###  we doubled and it was a blast  ###  bring your gravol though  ###  banana boating was $10  ###  beware of no price tags in the fleamarkets  ###  you can walk to the fleamarket  ###  its 25 min walk on the beach  ###  expect to pay 50-60% of the asking price  ###  bartering is a must  ###  they wo not tell you the price , they tell you what are you willing to pay and go from there  ###  bring your calculator too as everything is in pesos  ###  the vendors are aggressive , if you are not interested , keep repeating no , gracias  ###  and walk away we took the free shuttle to the palma real mall  ###  its a 45 min ride one way and a waste of time for us  ###  it was all high end stores , extremely expensive  ###  we did the bavaro runners punta cana/ bavaro day trip  ###  we traveled in an 18 person jeep to a sugar cane plantation , a typical home , a school ( sat , it was closed ) , tobacco place , went horseback riding , had lunch and swam at a private beach  ###  do not give money to the children  ###  if you do give money , the children will not go to school as it is easier to beg  ###  bring pencils or crayons for them instead  ###  there are people trying to sell you stuff at every stop though , from coffee to cigars to taino art  ###  the drivers are crazy , there seems to be no rules of the road  ###  the tour was well worth the money  ###  at the end of each day we enjoyed relaxing in the lobby bar  ###  good drinks and a nice place to chat , read a book or play cards  ###  it closes at 11:00 pm and then we found not much to do  ###  it should stay open until midnight and then you could head out to the pueblo principe  ###  pueblo principe is just on the outskirt of the lobby  ###  there is a karaoke bar and casino , vendors and stores  ###  the house band starts playing at 11:00pm and the disco opens at 12:00pm  ###  there are also nightly shows starting at 9:45 pm  ###  kind of lame , what can you expect , not our thing  ###  
78	but food not so great  ###  we stayed at this resort on the puna cana side from 6/9-6/16 in the diamond club  ###  there were 14 people in our group  ###  (2 yrs -60 yrs )  ###  everyone in my family thought the resort was beautiful , the lobby was grand compare to other resort we saw when dropping people of off from the airport  ###  even the paradisus lobby was by far no comparison to this one eventhough it cost more  ###  we did consider staying there prior to finding out about the gran bahia principe  ###  so glad i did not booked there  ###  airport : the process was quick and efficient , just pay $10 for a tourist card , after getting our bags we were whisk off and transfer immediately to our resort , it took about 40 mins  ###  since we had to made 3 prior stop to drop off others  ###  the return was a different story , it was chaos on the weekend , the line was super long and hot  ###  and it took forever to check - inhotel  rooms : beautiful ground  ###  it was breathtaking  ###  you wo not be disappointed  ###  the room was very spacious and nicely layout  ###  the king bed is truly a king compare with other resort i 've stayed in the past  ###  if you travel with young kids one can sleep on the sofa bed  ###  the maid will come and put sheet and pillow down for them  ###  they have crib for really little one , i requested for my 2yrs old  ###  it is a graco portable crib , which works out great since my little one naps in it at home so it was like sleeping at home for her  ###  the maid did a great job cleaning our room early everyday , we left her $2-3 tip each day , we got plenty of everything ( water , shampoo , towels , pillows ) beach/pools : the beach is gorgeous  ###  clean and not strong wave so it was perfect to swim in  ###  we did not have any problem reserving loungers at the beach for our big group  ###  i saw a lot of empty palapas  ###  if you have 2 or 4 in your group  ###  you should not have any problems finding shade at any time during the day  ###  food/drinks : i will start out with the drinks  ###  the fruit cocktails were sooo sweet it was like drinking syrup  ###  like the other reviews only the lobby bar makes decent cocktails  ###  the pool/beach bar was a hit or miss depending on what you ordered and the bartender  ###  do not even bother ordering a drink in there  ###  it was the worst  ###  do try the frozen bahia principe , it is pretty good but ask for it frozen otherwise they will serve it on the rocks  ###  a word on bartenders some were really nice especially the beach and pool ones but the ones in the theater and lobby do work for tips , if they see a buck in someone hand they will run over to serve them first  ###  everyone in our group do tip when we order drinks but we give it after if the service is good  ###  you should not have to buy service  ###  same for restaurants , our group would leave $20 - 25 in tip for the waiter if the service is great , the look on their face when receiving the $$ is priceless  ###  we got 4 ala carte so we booked 2 french , 1 seafood  1 japanese , here is my take on the restaurants : french : food was not good , portion was quite small and the service was extremely slow  ###  5 hrs for us to eat in there , i had the surf and turf ( lobster  steak ) , the steak was overcooked so it was really tough  the lobster was mushy because it was dead for sometime prior to cooking  ###  my whole family grew up on the coast eating seafood all our lives so we knew right off that it was not edible  ###  it does not matter what part of the world the lobster is from , if it 's mushy  ###  do not eat it or you can get really sick  ###  shellfish should not taste like that  ###  we tried to book other restaurant after our first dinner here but was not able to so we were stuck eating here twice one over puna cana and one over the bavaro side  ###  the service was not any better , everyone in my family did ordered something different hoping that it would be better but it still was not good  ###  seafood : if you are a seafood lover , do book this restaurant  ###  it has an appetizer bar with lots of good selection such as ( calamari , fish ceviche , seasoned shrimps , squids )  ###  we all had the lobster special  ###  it was really good  ###  the lobsters tasted like it should  ###  do ask for the garlic butter to dip with  ###  you will leave very full and satisfied  ###  the service here was also good  ###  japanese : it was okay if you 're looking for a different dining experience , we had a big group so they cooked everything for us ( beef , chicken , shrimps ) the shrimps were really small and previously frozen  ###  the service was super fast  ###  we were at the hibachi table less than an hr and was whisk away to another table to have dessert  ###  buffet : our group had to eat dinner buffet 3 consecutive nights , it does get repetitive and the food was not good  ###  i 've stayed at other ai in mexico and the food was much much better even at the buffet  ###  excursions : our family did the caribbean festival which was a lot of fun , it was a 4-5 hrs trip on a catamaran which we snorkel and party  ###  the do have dominican dancers to entertain you during the boat ride  ###  it cost $78/adult and half price for kids under 12  ###  my 6yrs old loved it  ###  they do require life jacket to be worn during snorkeling or else you have to sign a waiver if you do not want to wear one  ###  my husband , 6yrs old and 8 other family members did the atv crazy wheels (4 wheeler )  ###  they all had a blast  ###  they got to drive the vehicle for almost 3 hrs  ###  going through town , river , beach , coco plantation , swiming in a cave  ###  they video tape the whole excursion with everyone in it and sell it afterward for $35, my husband bought it since there were 10 of them in the group  ###  if you go in a big group it is worth buying  ###  it is $90 for single rider and double rider are $60, they do have helmets for everyone ( they do not allow you to ride without a helmet ) and my husband said all the vehicle was in great condition  ###  i do not know where the other reviewer booked their atv excursion that allow them to ride without a helmet and also for only $40  ###  maybe you get what you pay for  ###  do book your excursions in the tour operators office for a more organized and safer excursions , the scuba caribe sales people will go around to get you to book with them , they had a 2hrs snorkeling tour for only $28, they take you out on a small boat , it did not seem like a safe and quality kind of snorkeling trip  ###  so we all opted for the $78 snorkeling trip , glad we did it was worth it  ###  overall , the resort and beach is beautiful but the food was a little disappointing to us  ###  my husband and i have traveled the world and we are by far not picky eater because we love trying new food but here we have to rate the food as below average  ###  if they could improve on the food , this resort would be top notch  ###  keep in mind when booking here , if you come for the beautiful scenery , resort  beach you will not be disappointed but if you come expecting culinary cuisine  ###

be satisfied anywhere  ###  please reread those negative reviews  ###  i was wrong  ###  if you have not taken your vacation yet , please call your travel agent right away  ###  and change resorts  ###  we traveled to this alleged five star resort on july 6, 2007  ###  check in - surprisingly and contrary to other reviews , they allowed us to check in early right upon arrival  ###  resort appearance - the resort looks great in pictures and in person  ###  the greenery , buildings , lobby and beach are still great to look at  ###  now for the very bad 1  ###  extremely aggressive timeshare people in yellow shirts harass you in the lobby on the train , in the restaurants , on the beach  ###  they are everywhere and are a nuisance from the moment that you walk through the lobby  ###  we hated them and the last thing we wanted to do was buy a timeshare in that awful resort  ###  the room - the jr  ###  suite that we received looked nothing like the internet pics and did not resemble the nicer room that i had last time  ###  i did see rooms like i had before but we weren?? placed in one for some reason  ###  the furniture was somewhat worn and had a butlers pantry instead of a seating area  ###  i noticed little black bugs on the counters and in the bathroom but i attributed them to the fresh flowers and threw them out  ###  we were never able to get rid of the bugs during our stay  ###  they resembled ants but were smaller  ###  lack of food - they tell you to call the reservation hotline to reserve ala carte restaurants for the current day and the following day  ###  they forgot to say that no one ever answers that hotline  ###  it rings repeatedly , stays busy or when they do answer , they say ??e are all booked up  ###  ??lease call back later to check for cancellations or book for the next day  ###  after calling many times , we were unable to book a restaurant for our arrival day or the next day  ###  we gave up and went to the beach  ###  we tried the beach grill but there were few choices and lots of greasy snack bar foods  ###  plain pans of rice with a few carrots  ###  plain pans of fish , chicken or pork  ###  desserts were limited out there and it was hot in that beach grill  ###  the tables have no linen table cloths and your dishes will pile up because service is poor to non - existent in there  ###  i mistakenly reassured my husband that they had other restaurants that i enjoyed last time  ###  in the morning , they didn?? even have pans of scrambled eggs , pancakes or waffles  ###  isn?? that standard  ###  the omelet line is so long in the morning , you wouldn?? want an egg  ###  poor service - after spending a pretty great first day on the beach , we returned to our room only to find that we had no water coming into the bathtub/shower  ###  we called the desk for assistance but no one came after waiting for about 1 hour  ###  still no answer on that reservation hotline either  ###  we took off in search of restaurants  ###  we saw beautiful ala cartes with well dressed people who seemed satisfied but we found no buffets  ###  we saw signs for the buffets and looked on our resort map but still found no buffets  ###  finally we were informed that they have torn all of the buffet restaurants down and we discovered lots of construction  ###  finally we went to the front desk to again complain about the water/food issues  ###  we were tired , dirty and simply needed food  ###  surely they could have secured a restaurant reservation for us  ###  those restaurants were not full  ###  we were simply given the hotline number again and were told that the buffets from the past no longer existed  ###  the signs were wrong  ###  to make matters worse i detected an attitude from the lady at the front desk instead of sympathy  ###  the only place to eat is that awful , hot beach grill if you are unable to secure a reservation  ###  that grill would be used for all meals  ###  having no choice , we walked back to the beach grill to head off starvation  ###  the room shower was repaired finally but still had very little water pressure  ###  the next morning i tried the restaurant hotline again and managed to get a voice  ###  everything was booked for our second day already  ###  the thought of another day in that beach grill sickened me  ###  we were able to book a reservation for the japanese restaurant on the third day , however , we were told that we would have to stop what were doing in the middle of the day and pick up a ticket at the restaurant or we would not be admitted  ###  we were also told that we could call back to check on restaurant cancellations after 2:30 p  ###  we then noticed water all over the floor of the bathroom on the second day  ###  the toilet had suddenly sprung a leak  ###  i was also beginning to experience flu/viral symptoms that would plague me for the remainder of the week  ###  i could have contracted the illness on the plane but you never know  ###  i was able to live with the symptoms all week but it definitely put a damper on some activities  ###  spending the vacation on the phone dialing a hotline morning , afternoon and night and walking to various restaurants to pick up tickets was not how i planned to spend my week  ###  i also refused to watch hundreds of people enjoying the very upscale ala cartes while i stayed in the beach grill  ###  i lost all sense of calm and headed to the lobby to find the apple vacations rep who normally is stationed in the lobby of the hotel  ###  we found that he would be off for a couple of days  ###  i then went to guest services and requested that apple vacations be called  ###  
78	scammed at the excellence we were scammed at the excellence resorts in punta cana at their casino  ###  the first night of our 6th year anniversary vacation , we were given 2 $5 chips as we entered the casino to initially play some blackjack  ###  these chips were only to be used for super keno  ###  so we figured , hey , why not  ###  this was the beginning of our nightmare and the worst vacation of our entire life  ###  we made it up to 98 points that first night  ###  tim from arkansas smooth talked us , just like bill clinton  ###  i am a teacher and he told me how his sister is a teacher , too  ###  he told us nobody ever makes it to 98 points like this ( little did we know that his was a lie  ###  the same stories are told by others who got scammed on superkenoscam  ###  our jackpot was $52,000  ###  anyhow , our game got closed that first night because our bank card was apparently not swiping  ###  jack led me into the casino office to call my bank and shut the game down for approximately 1 hour  ###  although i was on the phone with my bank and they told me i had sufficient funds for a cash advance , the casino claimed the card would not swipe  ###  but , because the casino was so nice , they would hold the game for us another night  ###  so , the next night we went back to the casino  ###  the same issue was occurring  ###  i pulled out one ball  ###  oh , and what do you know it was a double  ###  oh great $100,000 jackpot , but or bet doubled as well  ###  but then my card was not swiping ( so they claimed )  ###  tim even told us how he told his mother about us , the nice couple from ct about to win a big jackpot  ###  again , i was led into the casino?? office  ###  same issue , my bank told me the funds are there , but the casino?? visane t machine kept stating , call bank  ###  they told us to go to the bank o popular tomorrow and they would comp the taxi ride and they?? hold the game yet another night  ###  so , on the third day of our vacation we take a taxi to the bank and take out a little less than $10,000 thinking if we hit a double again we would be able to cover the bet  ###  i mean we only had to hit that 2 point ball  ###  if we hit 98 points in one night , why couldn?? we hit one of the many point balls  ###  well , we now know  ###  it was all a scam  ###  well , we go back the third night with cash in hand  ###  of course , we hit another double  ###  now we??e up $200,000  ###  tim was telling us how he never had a jackpot so large  ###  so we bet again  ###  we hit a $10  ###  00, and then a $5  ###  we hit another double  ###  now our jackpot was up to just under $500,000  ###  we were forced to walk away because yet again our bank card was stating call bank when the swiped it  ###  however , i was on the phone with people?? bank and they told me that their computers were not showing that the casino was swiping it  ###  this happened for approximately 1 hour  ###  we were forced to walk away after we had invested our savings , approximately $20,000  ###  i am so embarrassed to say it  ###  my husband and i do not gamble  ###  we just figured if we got 98 points that quickly we were sure to get the 2 points needed to win the jack pot  ###  we have been saving to build our dream home and actually have not been on a vacation since our honeymoon 6 years ago  ###  we now realize this entire game was a scam from day one  ###  this is the scam  ###  tim would cover one of the numbers on the ball as he retrieved it  ###  he?? read off the number , while jack was distracting us  ###  we did not even see the number on the ball  ###  the numbers aren?? printed large on the balls , like bingo  ###  we trusted the american dealers  ###  they manipulated the game by losing your bet on repeat numbers or when they wanted to keep you invested they?? let you win a little amount of money  ###  there is a scam with double balls  ###  there is scam with them turning off the machine and allowing all the balls to drop  ###  there is a scam with them splitting up the husband and wife to call the bank  ###  hopefully a video may prove their guilt on the covering up the numbers on the ball when they take it out  ###  we complained to the excellence hotel management , who we think is in on this scam , and told them about what happened  ###  they ( rafael and jose maria ) kicked us out of their office  ###  they told us that they needed evidence  ###  they told us they have video surveillance of us signing for the money  ###  we tried to explain that is not the point  ###  so we printed out some of the stories that were written on the superkenoscam  ###  website regarding the scam at their hotel , even one that was recently posted on monday , july 23rd , 2007  ###  they did not even want to see it or talk about this matter further  ###  we have never been so cruelly treated by a hotel  ###  they are not supporting us , nor would advise us what to do  ###  they claim the casino is not part of the hotel , yet excellence employees gave us the chips and told us to play the super keno game  ###  we can?? even get a straight answer out of anybody  ###  we were even having difficulty finding out the names and numbers of the managers  ###  we spoke with the us embassy and i wrote a letter to the secretary of finance/office of casinos in the dominican republic  ###  however , when i asked the concierge to translate the letter , her boss said she couldn?? because something would get lost in translation  ###  so , i did my best at translating the letter myself  ###  we also wrote 3 letters/e - mails to the excellence hotel managers and general managers  ###  of course , there has been no response  ###  the excellence hotel will not even warn its guests about the super keno scam being run inside their hotel  ###

77	what am i missing  ###  well , i 'm going to surprise some people who are used to glowing reviews of this place , almost all of them 5  ###  0- - that 's what led me to book the #2 hotel in punta cana  ###  i must tell you first that my kids and i are club med junkies , and this was my 4th trip to punta cana and my only time outside of the club med  ###  the only reason we left the club med after 5 nights was that i 'd booked my trip last fall using aadvantage miles for 11 days , then come to find out afterwards that club med was closed because an italian company had rented out the entire place from june 2-7, right during the last half of my trip  ###  so i was forced to find another hotel  ###  after , as usual , a fantastic time at cm , we arrived at the iberostar only to find out that my travel agent had booked the iberostar punta cana and not the bavaro as i had requested , based on traveller reviews here  ###  i had read the documents and assumed that it said iberostar punta cana simply because that was the city it was in  ###  also , i 'd made the reservation last feb  ###  or so and simply did not remember the names of the other hotels next door when i was sent the travel documents a few weeks before departure  ###  my biggest word of advice is to double check this - -an honest mistake made by my travel agent because the names are so innocuous  ###  so , anyway , we arrive only to find out that we are in the other hotel , and by the faces of the front desk clerks , which is considered low rent  ###  i ask what the difference in cost is between the two and am told $480 for our 5 night stay based on myself , my 18 yr  ###  old son , and my 14 yr  ###  we ask to see a room , it looks fine , and we 're told that the other hotels have much worse rooms and that you ca not use the dining facilities at the bavaro if you are staying in the punta cana or dominicana  ###  so i got out my visa card  ###  well , we 're taken to the other side of the property from where they 'd shown us the sample room  ###  just as close to the beach , and i do not really pay attention to the hammering going on in the group of villas nearby  ###  every single morning , beginning at 8:30 am and lasting till at least 7:30 pm , there is construction , drilling , hammering so loud you want to scream  ###  it woke us up every morning , even on sunday  ###  the room next to us and below us were also under construction so they started pounding at 10 am there , but only on the first 2 days  ###  i would 've requested a room change except  ###  i was too busy throwing up the 2nd day  ###  yes , after one meal here ( dinner at the buffet ) , i got horrible food poisoning the following morning , could not leave the room all day , and finally called for a golf cart to take me to the doctor in the other hotel at 6 pm  ###  they were very nice , gave me an iv because i was so dehydrated , lots of medicine including some just in case such and such happened , told me not to pay until i came back the next day ( although they had told me it would be a $90 consultation fee )  ###  i might point out that they also could not believe it was really food poisoning , suggesting that it was from traveling , until i pointed out that i 'd already been in the dr for 6 days  ###  never once have i gotten ill at a club med  ###  anyway , so i go back the next morning , feeling much better , to get another iv and to pay the bill  ###  i did not need the sos pills , still in their unopened wrapper , for nausea but was unable to give them back as it was against policy from the pharmacy  ###  the grand total came to $272 for the hotel giving me food poisoning  ###  because it could not be proved , i had no recourse  ###  let 's see , the pluses : grounds are very beautiful , beach is beautiful , there is always food somewhere , rooms fairly spacious  ###  the bartenders and waiters are so happy  ###  they are always smliing , singing , and dancing  ###  they are definitely the best part of the place  ###  i did not want you to think i was totally negative  ###  more minuses , however : i had not read that men had to have pants in order to go into the sit - down restaurants  ###  since my son iis 18, he qualified as a man  ###  well , it is litterally 90 degrees and 94% humidity at that time of year , so we have never brought pants  ###  this is the same place where people are wearing bikinis without cover - ups at lunch  ###  so here we had 2 qualifying nights for the a la carte restaurants and could not use them  ###  yes , we could 've bought him some $70 pants in the boutique , but i was pretty fed up about having spent $752 by my 2nd day there  ###  we were able to go to the steak restaurant ( the only one where you do not have to wear pants that has table service ) and i could only swallow 2 bites of my rib eye  ###  shoe leather is more tender  ###  i feared the others would be as bad , so i did not bother with the pants  ###  the food is very plentiful , well presented , and horrible  ###  again , i hate to compare it to club med , which has fantastic food , but i felt very guilty taking food from the buffet and not being able to eat it  ###  some things were great , but they were few  far between  ###  also , they close the beach bar at 6 pm  ###  we could not do anything at night because we knew that we would be awakened at 8:30 by the construction and , prior to that , the damn peacocks screeching at 6 am  ###  not that the shows were so good that we did not mind leaving after 15 mins  ###  they were pretty bad  ###  maid service was spotty  ###  i requested another pillow and nothing ever showed up  ###  i asked again the next day and got it  ###  our 2nd to last day , the maid only gave us 2 bath towels  ###  i called for 2 more , and never got them  ###  room service is prompt ( when i could not leave the room , we all had stayed in for dinner , not that i ate ) , but the menu is very limited and they do not bring drinks  ###  i took one step class with broken down reebok steps right on the side of the pool  ###  the teacher had some woman ( guest ) from the u  ###  teach it for her , and i do not think she ever taught a class before  ###  plus , the real teacher did not know how to work the music , so we stopped after each song  ###  the class lasted 20 mins  ###  because she could not figure out the cd player  ###  it was a blessing to end it , however  ###  last thing : on our day of departure , we were supposed to be in the lobby at 11:35 for our shuttle to the airport  ###  i called for a golf cart to get our luggage that never showed up  ###  finally , at 11:30, my kids and i ran with the suitcases only to find out that the bus had left without us  ###  after much scrambling ( our gogo tours rep was , naturally , in the other hotel at this point ) , they found us another tour company 's shuttle who took us to the airport  ###  i saw someone there with an iberostar bracelet like ours and asked if they had been on the bus  ###  they said yes , but that the bus had left early and they had held it up by getting there at 11:30  ###  let that be another warning to you  ###  they 'll leave you , even if you 're early  ###  if anything , i expected a dominican tour bus to be late , not early  ###  that 's fine , i guess , but necessary to know , especially if they just up and leave you  ###  personally , i hate negative reviews  ###  i like knowing that the place i want to go to is fantastic , but that 's what i was led to believe by everyone else  ###  
77	save yourself the money i am going to give you our experience exactly how it happened and you can decide if you would want to stay somewhere like this  ###  we just got back last nightwe got to the hotel to check in and they basically ignored us and told us to stand off to the side  ###  after a couple minutes someone who barely speaks english comes and checks us in at this table off to the side , not even the front desk  ###  our room was not ready , so they told us to go to the restaurant , but didnt tell us where it was and they walked away  ###  we tried to get them to tell us when our friends would be checking in but they wouldnt  ###  the bell boy then walked our bags to our room  ###  we walked down these dirty , dark hallways  ###  our room had a good view , but it was dirty  ###  the bed was very hard and they didnt even have a full fitted sheet  ###  our legs and feet were on the bare matress  ###  the 'mini bar ' was barley stocked and was not cold  ###  the shower had almost no water pressure and would go steeming hot and freezing cold every 30 seconds ( no joke )  ###  the tv didnt work , it was just all fuzzy and the clock didnt work  ###  because the clock didnt work , we would call the front desk every so often and ask what time it was , most of the time we would get put on hold , transferred around and evenutally hung up on ( this happened many , many times )  ###  most of them also did not speak english  ###  the 'main bar ' by the pool has horrendous service  ###  the bartenders would just ignore us  ###  the first night we got there , we were standing there waiting ( for about 20 min ) and my boyfriend finally said excuse me to the bartender and she barely acknowldged him and when he started ordering drinks , then she walked away while he was in the middle of ordering and went to talk to the other bartender  ###  she didnt make our drinks and just continued to have a conversation with her friend  ###  at the seafood a la carte , we waited at the front door for about 10 mintues while all the workers walked by , ignoring us  ###  we finally sat ourselves , and when we saw the manager walk by we said excuse me and he held his finger up to his lips and said shhhh  ###  i was appauled  ###  they did the same thing to the next couple that came to the restaurant  ###  the tokyo a la carte was really good  ###  the best food and service we had all week  ###  the salad appitizer is really good  ###  the italian restaurant was good too  ###  there is only one buffet restaurant in the whole resort  ###  it is open 7:30-10:30am  ###  i personally think that the buffet was not open for long enough hours and the only other place to get food during the closed times is thesurf and turf snacks , which were disgusting  ###  do not eat the burgers there , they are never cooked properly and do not eat the fish burger , my boyfriend chipped his tooth on a huge bone that was in it  ###  i heard several other guests complaining about the food too  ###  the selection at the buffet was also very poor , the food was almost unedible  ###  i have seen others complain about the food at other all - inclusives , but have never had a problem with the food , but trust me , the food at the barcelo punta cana is very poor quality  ###  there were almost never any clean tables to eat at , and no one asked us for drinks , so you had to find your own cutlery and go get your own drinks  ###  the beach was gorgeous and the pool was nice too  ###  they only have one stereo system there , so if they are playing music at the beach , there will be no music at the pool and vice versa  ###  the entertainment workers were very pushy to get you to play games to partake in activities  ###  i was perfectly content watching my boyfriend and his friends play beach volleyball , but i had 3 separate male workers come up to me and harrass me to be part of a bikini contest , the second two that come over grabbed my arms and try to pull me over  ###  i was so angry  ###  i saw them to this to other girls too  ###  at nights , there were vendors set up on the resort to that you had to walk through them to go from your room to the restaurants  ###  they were very agressive  ###  i do not think this is a place that vendors should be  ###  i was really surprised that the hotel would allow this  ###  at the casino they tried to cheat us out of $15  ###  the other couple we were with was playing black jack , and the girl in the couple set aside $40 worth of chips that she would not play with  ###  she did not want to lose the $40  ###  when she went to cash it in , they gave her back $25, saying that is all she had  ###  after we argued with them for 5 minutes , the finally gave her the $15  ###  also , do not play the 'bonus bingo '  ###  we saw two different couples get scammed big time  ###  one lost $5000, the other lost $14000  ###  you need to get to 100 points and you acumulate them quickly , both these people got to 99 point with a large jackpot ( over $50000us )  ###  they kept playing because all they needed was 'one more point ', but they never got it of course  ###  and once your in $1000, how can you stop  ###  excursions : do not go on the excursions  ###  we did the dune buggy one where the pictures show you going through jungles and on grass and on the beach and it is supposed to be 4 hours long  ###  they take you there on a sketchy truck in the middle of a very poor area  ###  while on the buggies , the do not give you goggles or any eye protection  ###  you drive through this poor town to this 'cave ' area with vendors set up all around  ###  kids run up to you and try to get you to buy all these things and if you say no they pout  ###  as you are walking to the cave , vendors are constantly harrassing you  ###  it is horrible  ###  you leave this area to drive through the poor town again and they take you to a beautful beach , but they only let us stay here for 10 minutes  ###  it was about 45 mintues in total  ###  the next excursion we went on was the marinarium  ###  it looks cool in the pictures , but its is not what it seems  ###  you go on a boat and they drive out to an area to take you snorkelling  ###  there was next to no fish or anything in the area , but there are nurse sharks and mantarays in an enclosed cage area  ###  not what i expected  ###  you only actually snorkel for 25 mintues , then you drive around on the boat and listen to very loud music  ###  the give you a very gross sandwhich you make yourself out of stale bread  ###  all in all , this experience would make me never want to return to the dominican republic again  ###  we were all excited to go home to vancouver  ###  i have never been excitied to leave a trip  ###  i would definately not stay at this hotel if you would like to go to the d  ###  
77	the tale of two resorts let me preface my review by saying that this was the sixth all - inclusive vacation for my wife and me in the last 10 years  ###  it was our second trip to the dominican republic and our second stay at a gran bahia principe property  ###  trip outline : we were part of a group of eight that booked for two weeks at the gran bahia principe bavaro  ###  six of us had stayed at the gbp san juan together four years ago , and it was that experience that prompted us to book at gbp bavaro  ###  as a group we are firm believers that a vacation is what you make it  ###  life is too short to be whining and complaining about nitpicky things  ###  due to overbooking at gbp bavaro during our second week , we took advantage of an excursion offered by the resort and spent two days ( one night ) at the gran bahia principe cayacoa at samana  ###  upon our return we were ??pgraded?  ###  to the ambar section at punta cana  ###  travel to and from the dr : we travelled by air transat out of vancouver and the flight was pretty much what we expected  ###  we were through customs and on the bus in less than an hour upon arrival at punta cana  ###  there was some confusion once we reached the resort , as resort officials spent an hour shuffling us to three different registration desks before we could actually register  ###  things went quite smoothly on the trip to samana and back , and on our return trip to canada  ###  resort in general : as mentioned by previous posters , the resort is quite large ?  ###  something like 1,800 rooms in a series of ( mostly ) three - storey buildings  ###  having said that , we didn?? have too much trouble getting around , although we did use the trolleys on occasion  ###  our suite was in the middle of the resort , about 5- minute walk to the beach and about a 5- minute walk to the main lobby  ###  the diamond club pool was right out our front door and we spent most of our afternoons there  ###  a very beautiful resort and well maintained  ###  beaches and pools : during our ??eisure days?  ###  we tended to spend the mornings at the beach and the afternoons at the pool  ###  the beach is very nice , with soft sand and plenty of palapas  ###  even though we were a group of eight , we rarely had trouble finding a suitable spot to park ourselves ?  ###  close to both sun and shade , near the water and ( most importantly ) close to a bar  ###  the only pool we went to on the bavaro side was the diamond cub pool , which was smaller , but a whole lot quieter than the main pool  ###  once again , there was a good mix of sun and shade and we never seemed to have trouble finding a spot  ###  even thought the resort has rules prohibiting the ??aving?  ###  loungers with beach towels , it is a very common occurrence  ###  if you find a spot you like , it is wise to get there early and save your spaces  ###  buffet restaurants : we had breakfast at the main buffet restaurant twice and supper there three times  ###  it is very large and can be quite noisy at times  ###  the food is good and there is a good selection  ###  service is also very good  ###  one draw - back to the main buffet is the lack of an outdoor seating area  ###  we ate breakfast at the italian restaurant several times , primarily because we were able to sit outside  ###  the selection was good , but quite a bit more restricted than the main restaurant  ###  we had a lot of our lunches at the beach - side grill  ###  lots of seats and a small but tasty selection ( excellent roast chicken )  ###  a la carte restaurants : we e - mailed ahead and received pre - booking of the a la carte restaurants  ###  upon arrival , we already had reservations at the french , japanese , argentinean ( beach - side grill ) , garden grill ( steakhouse ) , seafood , italian and mediterranean restaurants  ###  most followed the same system with an appetizer buffet and a la carte ordering for the main course and dessert  ###  the french and mediterranean restaurants were a la carte appies and main course  ###  the japanese had a set menu that was prepared in front of you  ###  in all cases the food was flavourful and well - presented , although the portions were quite small in the french restaurant ( i had steak and lobster  ###  the steak was about 2 oz  ###  and the lobster tail wasn?? much larger )  ###  our preferences ( in order from favourite to least favourite ) were the garden grill , mediterranean , japanese , italian , seafood , french and argentinean  ###  excursions : we took a one - day guided tour into santo domingo  ###  it was a long day , but well worth it  ###  we got to visit the tomb of christopher columbus , the columbus museum and the oldest cathedral in the americas , as well as a walking tour through part of the old section of town and a stop at the presidential palace  ###  there was also time set aside for shopping at la romana ?  ###  on the trip in to santo domingo ?  ###  the cost was just under $70 per person , which included all applicable entrance fees and lunch  ###  we took a cab into downtown bavaro for a beer at steve?? corner bar and lunch at capitan cooks seafood restaurant  ###  the beer at steve?? was great ?  ###  good atmosphere on a busy street corner , so there?? lots to see  ###  lunch at capitan cooks was ( in my opinion ) a waste of time  ###  prices were high , the quality of food was not very good and the service was average at best  ###  two didn?? want to order after looking at the prices and one other sent her food back because she couldn?? eat it ( rubbery calamari )  ###  i ordered ceviche and calamari , but i can?? tell you what it was like , because i never did get my order  ###  maybe i should have hassled one of the servers to get my meal , but after seeing the quality of the calamari that what one of the other members of the group got , i decided to keep quite and save $25  ###  the hotel also offers free shuttle service to plaza palma real , a high - end mall in bavaro  ###  there is a cigar and rum shop at the mall that we found a good place to pick up smokes and rum  ###  good quality and selection and competitive prices  ###  here is also a hard rock caf? there if you have a hankering for a $20 burger and fries  ###  gbp bavaro experience : overall , we had a very enjoyable stay on the bavaro side of the complex  ###  there were a few minor problems , but nothing that impacted our stay  ###  the staff was courteous and professional  ###  ambar experience : the only real ??owner?  ###  our trip was our upgrade to the ambar section  ###  the ambar resort itself is beautiful , with a large , bright lobby and excellent food at the buffet and a la carte restaurants  ###  there is also a cigar lounge near the main lobby that is supposed to be open daily from 11 a  ###  it looks to have a good selection of cigars , but the two times i went to check it out ?  ###  once just after noon and once at about 5 p  ###  it was closed  ###  we had a few problems with our room when we checked in ?  ###  an in - room safe that didn?? work and a leaky toilet - - but both were fixed within the first day  ###  
77	huge does not begin to describe  ###  before deciding on this resort , i must have read a hundred reviews on this site  ###  a vast majority of the reviews gave this resort the big thumbs up  ###  so will mine  ###  we have been to punta cana 7 times staying mostly at the barcelo bavaro palace  ###  i mention this because of the size difference between the 2 places  ###  when people say the bahia principe is big , that 's an understatement  ###  this place is a city , maybe a city and suburb all to itself  ###  i am not into big places which is why i mentioned the palace  ###  no shuttles needed within the resort  ###  everything is a max 5 min walk  ###  not at the bahia principe  ###  the shuttles did run often , but you never really know where you will end up when you take one  ###  the only thing that made this resort managable was staying in ambar  ###  spend the extra if you have it and upgrade to the gold club  ###  that suburb i was talking about , it 's ambar  ###  you can walk to the beach , buffet , and a couple of the restaurants  ###  pools and bars along with the beach grill are all right there  ###  it has it 's own lobby area , where you can book golf , trips , water sports , ect  ###  it even has it 's own little shop  ###  it is adults only so if you are taking kids , and why would you want too , you ca not stay there  ###  food : all in all pretty good  ###  the ambar buffet was smaller but seemed to have a better variety of food for all meals  ###  at breakfast , you can get a mamosa or bloody mary when you walk in  ###  i do admit , the service could have been better , seemed to be understaffed and was hard to get drinks at the table  ###  not all the time but often enough  ###  we ate at the specialty restaurants finding the japanese and gourmet the best  ###  we did not rush to make reservations when we got there and generally did not have a problem changing things around as needed during the week  ###  i 'm not a fan of scheduling dinners but i guess alot of places are going that route  ###  and men , take the long pants  ###  you cannot eat at night , even the buffet , without long pants  ###  however , if you forgot them , they did offer room service all day , but the menu was mainly hamburgers and the like  ###  drinks : this is where this place blows the doors off the palace  ###  lower to mid level liquor available everywhere  ###  stoli on the rocks seemed to be the drink of the week for us  ###  after a couple of days , the bartenders remember you and have a drink ready to go , as long as there is not a line of people waiting  ###  champaign everywhere , mamajuana everywere , good scotch , good gin , forget the local stuff , they have real booze  ###  again , table service in the bars was a little slow  ###  they offered a drink of the day which was usually some fruity or chocolate thing  ###  all the bars closed at 11:00 pm  ###  rooms : i do not know anything about the rooms up front , but in ambar , outstanding  ###  big rooms , huge bathroom , jacuzzi bath tub and separate shower stall , marble floors , really nice  ###  the beds were comfortable and , get this , you can order different pillows depending on what you are used to  ###  everything from hard to feather pillows , did not find that out until the end  ###  the pillows in the room were a bit hard for me so i guess i should have taken the time to read all the propaganda in the room first thing  ###  and do not think you can open the balcony doors and get a nice breeze along with the a/c  ###  when you open the sliding doors , the a/c goes off until you close them  ###  so do not leave the doors open even a little or the room will be a sauna in no time  ###  get to know your housekeeper as well  ###  she was great about making sure you had enough supplies ( beer ) in your room  ###  the first day we stayed on the beach all day  ###  i took a small cooler on the beach for beer  ###  i asked my housekeeper if she could get me some presidente for the beach and before i knew it i had 20 cans of beer in my cooler  ###  i never had less then a six pack in my room the rest of the trip  ###  shuttles : yes they were all over the place but no they did not always take you where you wanted to go  ###  if you do not want to walk that much and you are staying in ambar , make sure your shuttle says ambar in the front  ###  otherwise you will ride all over the place and not get were you want to be  ###  there are two main entrances to the resort  ###  the punta cana side and the bavaro side  ###  all shuttle end at the bavaro side  ###  only the ambar shuttles go to the punta cana side  ###  that is where we checked in along with the gold club check in room and the casino is on that side too  ###  we did walk alot  ###  casino : really really small  ###  6 tables , maybe 40 slots  ###  get there early if you want to play anything  ###  seats fill up fast  ###  drinks are not included there as the casino is separate from the resort  ###  beach : just as you would think , it 's huge  ###  plenty of places for sun , shade , or to hide away  ###  we saw 2 weddings on the beach and they do a great job of decorating for it  ###  people do walk around offering you excursions but a simple no thanks sends them on their way  ###  if you plan on spending the entire day on the beach and want shade , yes you will have to get up a little early and grab a spot  ###  but if you are on and off the beach any other times , you can always find a place to sit your tired bones  ###  if you can handle the size of the place then i highly recomend this resort  ###  it is a first class facility , with a few bug still needed to be worked out  ###  i 'll go back , maybe one more time  ###  
77	not quite a 5 star yet  ###  an amazing setting  best beach ever ( so far  ###  ) my husband  i enjoyed our 7 night stay  ###  the grounds truly are lovely and very well maintained  ###  here 's the highlights : airport : funny when you get there because as everyone is piling off the plane , these gals grab you by the arm and a picture is taken and then they literally shove you away  ###  there 's no way around it and you have no choice  ###  we laughed about it since it seemed so abrasive , but got over it quickly  ###  you do not have to buy any of the pix and ca not see them until you 're back at the airport leaving  ###  quickest getting through customs ever  ###  beach : we could not get over how awesome this private beach area is  ###  soft sand , no rocks in the water and you can literally walk out for a long time with water still at your waist  ###  yes , there are waves ( red flags every day ) but i 'm a big sissy when it comes to water and i was in that water every day  ###  the waves are so fun  ###  been to every place in mexico and been to two hawaiian islands and this beach at excellence put all the others to shame  ###  you can walk forever  ###  we especially loved all the palm trees which are not like the 'transplanted ' ones in mexico , but cover the island  ###  there are plenty of places to rest in the shade and efficient bar service right to where you 're lounging  ###  pools : very nice and plenty of lounging room  ###  the beach is so amazing , however , we spent very little time at the pools  ###  rooms : rooms are definitely a little run down  ###  the housekeeping staff does a tremendous job cleaning them and keeping them the best they can be  ###  the rooms is an area where the management should spend some time and money  ###  they really just need some 'sprucing up ' like new paint , fix sliding doors and screens , etc  ###  the buildings need new paint and some major mold removal  ###  like i said , the rooms are lovely , just old and worn out  ###  they could also benefit from some new bed covers  ###  i 'm glad we only got the garden view room  ###  we had a swim out at the excellence mayan riviera and it was so worth it  ###  the swim outs here were too close to the noise and the patios were full of mold and mildew  ###  we got a 3rd floor ( highly recommended because of the great vaulted ceilings ) and our balcony overlooked the quiet pool  ###  it was great  ###  they would also benefit from getting rid of all the old , worn out and stained ( yes , stained  ###  a few times we got nice , new towels that were thick , but most of the time we got the old , thin ones  ###  do not count on too many washcloths either  ###  they just do not bring them often ( we had three for the whole week  ###  )food : do not get your hopes up  ###  the food is not that great  ###  there 's a buffet for breakfast which has anything you can imagine  ###  there 's always 'hot food ' cooking stations and tons of options  ###  breakfast is good and you 'll certainly find what you want  ###  lunch is hit or miss  ###  there 's a buffet lunch which has average variety and is good for about the first two days  ###  nothing to write home about , but average food and you get over it  ###  the a la carte places for lunch are great if you like hamburgers , french fries , sandwiches etc  ###  again , not the best food  ###  dinner : pretty disappointing as far as taste is concerned  ###  the french restaurant was the best  ###  the best service , atmosphere and food  ###  toscona , the italian place , was a close second and the service was also amazing here  ###  the agave , spice , barcelona  grill were all equally below average and below average service  ###  again , food is hit or miss  ###  do not expect 5 star cuisine  ###  wo not happen  ###  staff : we were so expecting the staff to be as wonderful and accomodating as we 'd read about  ###  this was the biggest disappointment , i think  ###  we found the staff at places in mexico to be far superior in both attitude and service than this excellence  ###  some were absolutely great and did go out of their way while others were indifferent and even forgot they were waiting on you and forgot to bring things you 'd ordered  ###  you just get over it and remember that these people work horribly long hours and it 's probably difficult to maintain a high level of service when you 've been there since 6:00am and expected to stay until after 11:00pm  ###  room service : a joke , really  ###  twice they totally forgot to bring our food and after calling twice , they finally admitted that they forgot  ###  the other time we ordered a pizza they said it would take 20, no 30, no 40 minutes ( that 's how they said it over the phone  ###  we got it an hour and 15 minutes later and were alseep by then so we just told them to take it away  ###  bar drinks : also hit or miss  ###  there are only two bartenders that know how to make drinks  ###  they do not know how to make simple things like lemon drop martinis or a cosmo  ###  terrible margaritas too  ###  they have a drink of the day which will taste like the drink of the next day and the next day  ###  house wine is not that bad  ###  they use all the same 'mixes ' so your drinks really will taste pretty much the same  ###  ask for a caiparinia ( sort of like a mojito  ###  which they 've never heard of )  ###  cocoloco also very good  ###  shows : they do the very best they can  ###  they bring in a different show each night which is probably not an easy thing to do , so applause for the person in charge of booking the shows  ###  the shows are high school quality , at best , but some people really enjoyed them  ###  we 're in the enterainment business , so we found them to be cheesy  boring , but they do a good job of trying to offer something fun every night  ###  they had the exact same shows in excellence mexico last year , so we 'd already seen them  ###  
77	wonderful , amazing , beautiful ok , first off i have to say that part of the reason we had such a wonderful , amazing trip was because of all the great advice that i got from the good citizens of tripadvisor  ###  the excellence is a beautiful resort and anyone who books their vacation here is bound to have an amazing trip ( unless you are one of those people that is only happy when you are complaining or unhappy - we met a few of these people on our trip and i was so disappointed )  ###  i do not think i can say enough good things about the place but i am going to try to give you a very comprehensive , unbiased review  ###  we stayed from jan  ###  2 - jan  ###  we were booked into the excellence club and had an ocean view honeymoon suite  ###  so here goes : arrival : we booked a helicopter through helidosa to take us from the airport to the resort  ###  the first thing was that when we got off the plane at the airport , it was very confusing  ###  people were running everywhere trying to take your bags from you before you even had a chance to figure out what was going on  ###  do not give up your bags until you know who you are giving them to and are sure that you are giving them to the right company  ###  we were supposed to have been greeted with a sign with our names on it so that we would know where we were going but that did not happen and it was difficult to find the helidosa guy and very confusing trying to figure out what was going on but  ###  everything worked out just fine and we got our bags on the transport to our hotel and were taken to where we were supposed to get the helicopter  ###  we ended up having to wait 40 minutes for the helicopter to come which was very disappointing because we were taking the helicopter so that we could get there faster  ###  this did not happen , our bags got to the resort way before us  ###  this is not the resorts fault  ###  this was an error on the part of helidosa  ###  when we got to the resort we were dropped off in the back and just kinda left there , with no idea how to get where we were going  ###  we just followed the path and found our way eventually but it would have been nice if someone had showed us how to get where we needed to be  ###  not too difficult  ###  when we finally made it inside , we were greeted with a glass of champagne and eventually taken to the club where we did our check in  ###  the people in the excellence club - especially maria , nicki , carlos and roberto ( these were the only ones i talked with ) were amazing and extremely helpful  ###  we checked in with them and were informed that we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite , which i had asked for but had not actually reserved  ###  thank you roberto  ###  nicki brought us up to the club lounge and we were served with the drink of our choice and some snacks while they checked that the room was ready for us ( this took about 2 minutes ) then we were shown to our room and what a beautiful room it was  ###  huge bed , vaulted ceiling , two balconies  ###  one over looking the pool/ocean and the other overlooking the ocean with a hottub on it  ###  spent most of my time on that one as it was more enclosed and larger  ###  the hot tub was amazing ( it leaked at first but maintainence was there in a jiffy to fix it )  ###  everything about the room was perfect  ###  no complaints , and although i read some reviews that said there was a smell and brought a plug in for that , there was no smell except that of the ocean and the tropics  ###  ok that 's enough about the room , it was amazing  ###  foodthe food was terrific , i was not able to eat at chez isabelle as the schedule was a little confusing and it was not open everynight and i was unable to have dinner at the grill but we ate everywhere else and it was all amazing  ###  i had amazing dinners everynight that i ate and have absolutely no complaints about the food  ###  the breakfast buffet at toscana was excellent - we did not get a chance to eat breakfast anywhere else  ###  lunch was incredible at both the grill and toscana  ###  i would have to say my least favorite was agave although the food was not horrible , it just was not too my liking  ###  my husbands favorite restaurant was spice and the food there was delicious , i really liked toscana  ###  but no matter what the food you get is delicious and if you do not like something you can order something else  ###  one night we went with friends to spice and ordered the whole left side of the menu and half the right  ###  if you are eating at spice ask for victor he is the greatest there  ###  you will have a wonderful dining experience  ###  drinksthe drinks were delicious and plentiful  ###  i did not think that they were too light with the alcohol and they were very quick to serve  ###  i enjoyed the different daily drinks  ###  it was a fun way to start off the day  ###  i especially enjoyed the sammy sosa  ###  barsall of the bars are serviced by terrific people who are there to show you a good time and they do it  ###  the swim up bar , cafe kafe , the martini bar , the pool bar and the lobby bar are all terrific  ###  the bartenders there will make sure you are having fun and take great care of you  ###  say a special hello to baurilo  ###  he seemed to be our bartender no matter what bar we went to  ###  the beachthe beach was beautiful and fun but the waves are strong and the rip tide is very powerful  ###  i was still able to go and play in the waves and i had a great time but i would not recommend that anyone go out much past your waste  ###  and if you are not a strong swimmer , avoid it all together , it is not worth the risk  ###  if you walk down the beach to the right around the point you will find a spot that is kinda enclosed by a coral reef , it is a nice little cove and is great for swimming , not much current at all and you can even snorkel there  ###  but be careful  ###  the ocean is a living thing and it is not something to be ignored  ###  people can get hurt if they are not careful  ###  the pools were amazing  ###  much to my disappointment , i did not get to spend anytime in the cascade pool or the waterfall , but i did check it out and it was beautiful  ###  i mostly stuck to the main pool on the ocean side of the resort  ###  this pool is incredible  ###  you can float all over the place and that is where the swim up bar is  ###  also cool that you could float underneath the diners at the grill  ###  we had a lot of fun  ###  lounge chairs at the pool were hard to come by but if you asked one of the workers they would usually help you  ###  i only had a problem finding a chair one day out of 7 and even that was no biggie  ###  because we shared with another couple and it was fine  ###  the beds were hard to find as well but not impossible , in fact , i found a couple but never ended up wanting to use them because i wanted to be in the sun  ###  beach/pool towelsok , we had beach towels in our room everday plus we brought towels from home so we never had a problem  ###  none of the people we met ever had a problem either but i did note that there were a number of towel hogs  ###  people would take 10-15 towels and go lay them all out on one of the beds and then cover themselves up with two or three and use the rest as pillows  ###  this really bothered me even though it did not effect me  ###  nobody needs 10 towels  ###  people need to be less selfish  ###  casinothey tell you right away , the casino is not owned by the resort  ###  when we met with our vip rep , jonathan , he told us do not play the keno or roulette  ###  
76	are we all talking about the same place  ###  we recently got back from our stay at the gran bahia ( july 2-16) , and i felt compelled to write a review  ###  i am so surprised to see so many negative reviews from others who stayed at the same time  ###  while i have some suggestions for the hotel , i would definately have to say that our stay was wonderful  ###  if you have booked your trip and are reading these negative reviews , do not worry  ###  if you are ready to have a good time you will  ###  we spoke to several people over our stay and everyone was generally pleased  ###  please forgive the long review , but i want to be as objective and thorough as possible  ###  reception desk : we arrived at the hotel around 2:30 and were taken to our room right away  ###  there is a fee for the safe  ###  if you are planning to do this , do it when you arrive  ###  , the desk is often tied up with people coming back to activate the safe , and it can be a real hassle to wait on line  ###  our room : the room was clean , beautiful , spacious and comfortable  ###  the fridge was not consistently cold , but if you stuck a bevarage in ice for a few minutes it would be ready to drink  ###  mini bar has beer , soda and water  ###  this was stocked everyday and often a few extra beers were thrown in because we had asked for a couple extra the first night  ###  there was also a coffee maker in the room  ###  the service to the room was great  ###  on one occasion we did not have towels and they brought them over right away  ###  they also provided us with a iron and ironing board immediately upon our request  ###  we did not have anything taken out of our room  ###  hotel grounds : the grounds are large and immpecable  ###  everything was clean and well groomed  ###  they are big , but i found this to be a plus  ###  if you want a small hotel this is not the place for you  ###  they do provide a tram service which runs from the lobby to the beach  ###  the trams run frequently , but we generally walked  ###  security was all along the path in the evening and we always felt very safe  ###  be sure to note where your villa is  ###  we became a little disoriented the first night and all the villas look the same  ###  beach : the beach was clean  ###  there were a ton of chairs and palapas , so we never had difficulty finding a spot  ###  the water was refreshing and there is a shipwreck directly in front of the hotel  ###  towels were readily available with the card exchange system  ###  we were alwasy able to get a clean dry towel  ###  pools : the pools were large and they all have swim up bars  ###  the bartenders were extremely friendly , and yes they might call you friend , but i only see this as a positive  ###  they were always friendly and pleasant  ###  the service was excellent and we never waited very long for drinks  ###  entertainment staff by the pool was excellent as well  ###  activities were offered , but not forced on anyone  ###  the water aerobics were fun  ###  they must have been effective too because i did not gain any weight  ###  which brings me to  ###  food : the buffet was probably on of the best i 've seen at an all inclusive  ###  they did vary the menu daily and there was always something to eat  ###  they were constantly restocking everything  ###  as far as the a la carte we enjoyed  ###  the garden grill ( steakouse ) , the japanese , the gourmet and the dominican  ###  the seafood was not our favorite  ###  the snack bar by the beach was convenient , but the variety was much better in the main buffet , so we mostly ate there  ###  mini - club : we traveled with my 8 year old and she used the mini - club while we were there several times  ###  they seemed to have plenty for the kids to do and she enjoyed it , but the hours were 9-12:30 and 2:20-4:45, so sometimes it required more effort to coordinate the times  ###  there were also a few days when the hours were shortened and they opened later  ###  they leave the club for activities too , so they might not be at the location when you drop off if it 's in the middle of a session  ###  they had a mini - disco every night and on most nights a game  ###  they game was also called off on a few nights when the mc was unavailable  ###  this was not a sign - in service and we would hang out to watch it  ###  they also had a lion king show where the kids are able to participate , which was pretty cool  ###  staff : they were extremely friendly and were always having a good time  ###  i do not know if they are this way with everyone , but if you are friendly to them they are twice as nice back  ###  we encountered plenty of rude people during our stay  ###  maybe they are the ones getiing the poor service , but we never had any issues  ###  entertainment : shows at night were held at 9:45  ###  we enjoyed the circus and lion king , but did not go every night , because we were ready for bed  ###  minor suggestions for the hotel :1  ###  include the safe in the rate , so people do not feel nickel and dimed  ###  i 'd have rather paid the extra up - front  ###  also it creates congestion at the reception desk  ###  put shower curtains in the bathrooms  ###  we found it difficult to shower without flooding the bathroom3  ###  post or distribute an activity schedule , so people will know what activities are offered and when  ###  make sure the activities are consistent or note publicly when they will vary  ###  it 's frustrating to go all the way to the mini - club to find out that it is closed for an extra hour at lunch time  ###  also hire people to fill in when the regulars are out , so the activities can continue in their absence  ###  e mini disco game  ###  
76	perfect for our honeymoon  ###  my husband and i chose the excellence punta cana for our honeymoon , and it definitely did not disappoint  ###  we did a lot of research on the different resorts in punta cana , and excellence seemed to have everything we were looking for and it was also the most well - reviewed punta cana resort on all the travel sites we looked at  ###  i 'll try to be as thorough as possible in reviewing all aspects of our trip  ###  we stayed for 6 nights/5days in october 2008  ###  we connected from la via miami , and had no problems getting into the country  ###  it was a breeze moving through customs there - you pay $10 to get a tourist card , which once you get you just hand over to the next official , so its just a fee for entering the country  ###  have your customs form filled out and your $10 ready and you 're all set  ###  right after customs you come into an area packed with bellhops ( for lack of a better word ) , who all jockey for position to help everyone arriving  ###  we told our guy who our shuttle company was ( prieto tours , recommended hen you book through american express ) , he took our luggage and got us right over to their desk  ###  we were then ushered right out to the waiting shuttle bus , and although we did have a bit of a wait before we got moving , it was a large tour bus , air - conditioned and very comfortable  ###  our bus driver and guide were both very nice and informative , giving us a few tips on the ride there  ###  the ride to the hotel took about 75 minutes , and was definitely not as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be  ###  i guess it depends on which shuttle/taxi you take  ###  although our bus was very nice , large , and newer , there were some sorry - looking ones at the airport as well  ###  yes , its a long drive , and the road was often bumpy and winding , but we were very comfortable and i enjoyed taking in the scenery  ###  the road takes you through at least 2 towns , giving you also a glimpse of the local life in the dr  ###  we arrived at the hotel and were greeted with smiles and champagne  ###  we splurged on the excellence club , which in my opinion was definitely worth it , for reasons i will detail later  ###  because of this , we were escorted straight to the excellence club for check - in  ###  there we were given a tour of the excellence club , some information regarding our stay and what to expect , and then taken to our room  ###  the concierge was so nice , helpful , and accomodating throughout our stay  ###  our room was clean and comfortable throughout our stay , although the bed was definitely harder than i prefer  ###  housekeeping would come twice a day ( once in the morning and once for turn down ) and our mini bar was also re - stocked twice a day even though we did not need it replenished that often  ###  they also give you a newsletter each night detailing the activities going on the next day , which restaurant is closed , and the weather report  ###  the only issue i had was getting some bites on my feet and ankles on the second night - and the only thing we could attribute them to was something in the bed , because i slept underneath the covers but my husband slept on top of them , and he was not bitten at all  ###  i got a few more throughout our stay , but they were just red bumps and never hurt or itched or bothered at all , so i 'm not sure what they came from  ###  october must be a slow time for the resort , because it was not crowded at all and we never once had problems with getting a good spot by the pool or on the beach , and never had to wait at any restaurant or very long for drinks  ###  people were out early claiming chairs by the pool , but that seemed unnecessary because there was always more than enough to go around  ###  i love the fact that this resort is adults only  ###  which also meant it was mostly couples , which gave the entire atmosphere a safe , calm , and relaxing vibe  ###  our favorite spot was right by the swim - up bar - definitely our favorite bar  ###  the bartender was awesome and made all our favorite drinks and anything we requested , and we had fun trying out new ones ( ask for the sammy sosa or a coco loco  ###  i 'm not a big drinker because i generally do not like the taste of alcohol , but the drinks were made so well i could hardly even tell they had alcohol ( which i knew they did because i watched him mix them up  ###  we spent most of our days in and around the pool at the swim - up bar , and a few times we went over to the beach in the afternoons  ###  the beach was gorgeous and i loved napping on the beds  ###  the water was warm but the waves were so strong that not too many people ventured out  ###  i think this could have been because it was still in hurricane season , so i 'm not sure if htey are like that all the time  ###  there were certain areas marked off to not go into , and just one small area that was safer but still warned against because of the strength of the waves  ###  we had a good time just watching people get knocked down , including my husband who thought he could dominate the waves  ###  the food was good , sometimes great , nothing outstanding  ###  for breakfast and lunch you are limited in the options  ###  we went to toscana every day and had the buffet  ###  i think the lobster house was also open with lighter breakfast options , and the grill was open for lighter lunch options  ###  they did try to change up the buffet options but we definitely had had enough of it by the time we left  ###  because we were eating at toscana every day for breakfast and lunch , we never tried it for dinner  ###  there are seven restaurants at the resort and each night one of them is closed  ###  no reservations needed for any of them  ###  some of them do have dress codes that they do enforce , however  ###  ladies can get away with more , but be sure to bring some nicer dresses , pants , and dressy sandals  ###  for men most of the places required pants , collared shirts , and shoes  ###  each one is a different cuisine and they all have rather limited menus  ###  the first night we went to the lobster house , where lobster is really the only thing on the menu and you can choose how you want it cooked and what side dish you want  ###  it was decent , but not good enough to want to go back  ###  agave is the mexican place , and the only thing i liked there were the chips and guacamole , although my husband liked his entree  ###  spice is asian , and was perfect for a lighter meal , we both really enjoyed it and it was the only place we went twice  ###  chez isabelle is french cuisine and my husband and i agreed that it was the best complete meal we each had  ###  we did not go to barcelona ( mediterranean ) or the grill  ###  room service is also available , and we did order something on our last night but it never came  ###  but the service was great everywhere  ###  all of the staff , waiters , hostesses , bartenders , etc were so friendly , courteous , accomodating and helpful  ###  they all spoke at least a little english , so communicating was never an issue for us  ###  we followed the advice of some other reviewers and just brought $100 in $1 bills , and used that all week for tipping  ###  everyone really appreciated the tips and you could tell they were not always expecting it  ###  we also spent a few nights at the sports bar after dinner , although never for very long because it 's outdoors and would get very humid and the bugs were pretty thick there  ###  there are a few pool tables , foosball tables , and ping pong , and some big tv screens for watching sports  ###  its a smaller bar but they also had various snack items available each night ( popcorn , nachos , chicken wings )  ###  we were glad we went for the excellence club , because that gave us free internet use and access to the excellence lounge , which was always stocked with beverages and lighter food options all throughout the day  ###  there is also a tv up there and bar service , so it was more comfortable to hang out there than at one of the outdoor bars  ###  we did not do any of the extra activities they offer , like horseback riding , but they are available  ###  the casino in the resort was closed for maintenance , but they were offering a free shuttle to a nearby resort if you wanted to gamble  ###  the nightly entertainment was sometimes entertaining ( michael jackson show was pretty funny ) and sometimes too painful to watch ( karaoke )  ###  overall , the excellence punta cana was a wonderful choice and we would definitely go back  ###  the best points for me are its all - inclusive and adults - only , the location is perfect and the staff was awesome  ###  i would highly recommend excellence  ###  please feel free to contact me if you would like any further detail on anything  ###  
76	very bad experience please allow me to describe our experience at the occidental grand flamenco in punta cana , bavaro domenican republic  ###  we travelled march 24th 2007 from toronto  ###  we assumed this resort was a luxurious executive getaway  ###  as it turned out , it was not cheap to stay there ( over $5,000 cdn ) , but it was our worst ever holiday experience  ###  we arrived there on saturday march 24th 2007 at approximately 9:45 in the evening  ###  although the resort was only about 30 minutes from the airport , we had to wait there for other passengers , drop them off at their resort (5 stops )  ###  in our humble opinion a 4+ - star resort should have a passenger shuttle that offers direct service and at the very least a soft drink or a bottle of water while we waited 20 minutes to depart the airport - none of these services were offered by the occidental grand flamenco  ###  after driving all the vacationers to their resorts , we finally got to the occidental grand  ###  we were not greeted with any drinks as expected from a 4+ resort and wasted another 45 minutes arguing with the person at the premium service desk because our rooms were all messed up  ###  we had specifically asked for 2 rooms next to each other and not 2 rooms in separate buildings as i have a 10 year old and a 16 year old  ###  my friends who traveled with us had the same issue and were forced to sleep in our second room ( which was temporary to be for one night only )  ###  the stress caused in the first two hours alone put a huge dent in our first impression of the resort and in our enjoyment of our vacation  ###  the row of our disappointments do not end here , there is plenty more : we paid for ??remium club package ?  ###  we were given building 12 room 12110, 12109 which are not transat premium club rooms  ###  we had no fruit baskets in the rooms , no bathrobes , slippers and beach towels and no rum or alcohol in the mini bar  ###  we were hungry and needed to eat but the restaurant buffet was closed  ###  we ended up spending the rest of our evening waiting for pizza  taco?? located up on the balcony next to the italian restaurant  ###  we finally got our food after waiting in line for 35 minutes  ###  the second day of our stay at the occidental resort started out by not having any electrical or water service  ###  this prevented us from taking a shower , brushing our teeth , washing our hands and flushing the toilet  ###  what a terrible experience for civilized people with high hygiene standards  ###  i went and hunted down felix who , by now , had plenty of notes concerning complaints from the resort guests  ###  i told him about the water problem ( or the lack thereof ) , and he told me that the resort has some problems with the electricity , and that ( according to what he knows from the resort staff ) , the electricity and water service should return shortly  ###  felix also asked us to come back at 3:00 pm to change our rooms  ###  the power did not come back on until after 9:00 that evening  ###  note : still no premium service that we paid for  ###  the breakfast of our second day had a pleasant surprise : they served fresh fruit  ###  this was about the only type of food i enjoyed so far  ###  but , not to get carried away with too much pleasure , they ran out of bananas  ###  i tried to ask the restaurant staff for more bananas , but they either did not understand or they were too lazy to get some , or had none  ###  i put some more effort into my sign language by trying to show them the color and the substance of the material , and succeeded after about 5 painstaking minutes : they presented me with 4 rotten smelly bananas?  ###  covered in onion peal  ###  i can only imagine where they got them from  ###  at this time i had a chance to speak with a spanish speaking guest from spain who was able to tell me ( in great english ) that in her experience the guests must beg the staff for anything that would normally be served as a standard at any other vacation resort  ###  she ( along with us ) was quite annoyed to say the least  ###  on our third day , we went to see felix about our premium suite and he advised that the best he can do is offer us 2 rooms in building 24 but they are far apart  ###  this didn?? work for us as we didn?? trust our two children sleeping down the hall on their own  ###  felix said that he could send the towels , robes and everything offered in those rooms to our room in building 12  ###  since we were only staying for one week we had no choice but to accept as the last thing i wanted was to spend my entire vacation in the lobby arguing with him  ###  that afternoon we found the towels , robes etc on our bed  ###  the power went out again for half the day and the toilets and water service did not work  ###  the rain flooded the walk ways and hallway leading to our room  ###  water was seeping in from under our door from all the water  ###  my wife slipped and fell on the wet stone tiles - it proved to be very slippery when wet  ###  i went to the reception and i spoke to the reception desk  ###  i told him about the water and he said that there is nothing he can do about the flooding  ###  that evening , we all got sick and spent most of the day on the toilets  ###  my 16 year old son was vomiting all night and had fever  ###  my 10 year old son also became very ill with stomach problems  ###  on our fourth day , we had no clean towels , no clean slippers and the mini bar was not stocked ( is this the premium package )  ###  the power went out again for at least 5 hours  ###  we went to have dinner at 7pm to the only available restaurant  ###  the table cloths were dirty and stained , some of the cutleries had remainders on them from previous meals , and there was no serviette on the tables  ###  in fact there was nothing on the tables except a salt and pepper shaker  ###  we had to get everything from the middle of the restaurant  ###  they had cheap napkins though , it was better than nothing  ###  at this time the only thing that made us feel some comfort was that we were going home soon but , back to reality , we found out that the only four cooked meals were not heated by any means from below ( at the buffet tables )  ###  which means that within a mere 30 minutes everything became cold  ###  when a pan got empty , nothing was replaced by the kitchen staff because they had no power  ###  by thursday evening our suite reeked from the stink that the un - sanitized toilet caused  ###  this is totally absurd and very un - healthy situation that we had to clean up and we have paid a considerably large amount of money for this which we normally would not do even if it were our job - unless we were getting paid a very large amount of money for it  ###  the smell of the toilets was unbearable  ###  how do they expect us to sleep in our suite like this  ###  we also earlier found out that the 2 rooms that my friends had in building 23 were given away to someone else  ###  we used those rooms during the day as it was closer to the beach  ###  the supervisor explained that the maids always found the rooms clean so they assumed that they were vacant?  ###  here is the best part  ###  they checked my friends out of the hotel  ###  they didn?? exist in the resort anymore and the only reason we found out was because their family back home called to speak to them and couldn?? find them  ###  on friday , my 10 year old son became very ill and needed medical attention which cost me $168 us  ###  we spent the entire day in our dirty room  ###  we asked felix to arrange a taxi for us to go to the airport earlier and to my surprise they did  ###  we couldn?? wait to leave as we were all very sick  ###  my son was vomiting in the airport and starting shaking from the lack of hydration in his body  ###  we saved for an entire year for this trip and came back more stressed out than when we left home  ###  i cannot believe we had to experience this as a family vacation  ###  
76	" okay " time at the majestic  ###  let me start off with a tip that i wish someone would have told us before we left  ###  *bring a big travel mug with you  ###  the cups are small at the resort so if you want a big cup of coffee or a big 'pina colada ' or beer to walk around with - bring a travel mug with you  ###  we booked our trip because the majestic was rated #1 on tripadvisor  ###  it 's now slipped to #2  ###  we had better service at a 3star resort in la romana than we did here  ###  let me say the positives : richard at the front desk was very friendly and helpful  ###  i contacted him before we left as i did not want a room facing the construction  ###  he took care of us and we got a beautiful room  ###  we had a colonial junior suite and it was lovely  ###  there was a huge terrace overlooking the ocean  ###  the housekeeping staff was very friendly and kind  ###  we had rum , wine , champagne , whiskey , pepsi , chocolate , water , coffee and espresso in the room  ###  aside from the chocolate , it was re - stocked every day  ###  the walk in shower is really nice and had lots of hot water and pressure  ###  there was a really comfy terry robe to use - i loved it  ###  there is an iron  ironing board in the room - ours did not work very well but we did not need it much anyhow  ###  the pool is outstanding however it was too cold to swim around in when we were there  ###  there are plenty of chairs but you have to play the towel game if you want to get one  ###  it really is not fair to put your towel on a chair at 8am so it can be yours at 2pm  ###  it 's a little annoying - wish that could change but  ###  never a problem getting a drink  ###  the main drinks are from 'slushy ' machines  ###  the main buffet had lots to choose from  ###  we enjoyed the seafood restaurant  ###  we had the lobster twice - very yummy  ###  the gym was adequate  ###  it smelled pretty musty and could use a good cleaning  ###  it had free weights , treadmills , some machines and benches  ###  you could certainly get a good workout there  ###  it was air conditioned and music was always playing  ###  at the piano bar , a young gentleman played the piano every night  ###  it was very nice to sit and listen to him while having a coffee or drink  ###  the shows were pretty corny but that is personal opinion  ###  we avoided the disco as it was too smoky  ###  it would have been nice if the resort had a beach party one night or had some night time activities/games  ###  we did have bugs in our room  ###  lots of ants and a few mosquitoes  ###  i 'm still scratching at the bug bites on my legs  ###  i 'd wake up each night with a few new ones  ###  the service staff at the buffet needs some training  ###  we are not demanding people but a smile would be nice  ###  there is a language barrier  ###  if you do not speak spanish , learn a few key phrases before you go  ###  basically - - - if you want good service , you have to tip ( at least that is how it was for us )  ###  it seemed the more you tipped , the nicer they were to you  ###  at the last resort we stayed in , there was a no tipping policy and everyone got great service , every day , from every one  ###  ( we should have went back there )  ###  now - i 'm not saying we got bad service from everyone  ###  the seafood restaurant had good service every time  ###  we were told not to go to the steak house as the meat was tough and food bad  ###  we avoided it  ###  here 's the bad stuff : i got very very sick after eating at the so called gourmet restaurant  ###  the next morning was the worst i have felt in my life  ###  i spent the day in the room as i did not want to travel to far from the 'washroom '  ###  it took 5 days to get back to myself  ###  it was not pleasant  ###  others got sick as well ( see past reviews )  ###  there are cockroaches  ###  we had a laugh at a bunch of them that were swarming ( a nest maybe  ###  ) in a wicker table across from the piano bar  ###  when you put a warm drink on the glass , they would emerge ( under the glass )  ###  we pointed it out to the waitress who got startled at the sight of them  ###  i hope they take care of the problem before you get there  ###  they had men wearing masks spraying chemicals on the plants in mid day  ###  the problem is that they had masks and we did not  ###  it 's not pleasant to get a whiff of that stuff when you walk by  ###  be prepared to get grabbed and hassled when they have the 'market '  ###  if you want to buy a souvenier , you will be hounded  ###  a man wanted us to pay $130 american for a little blue necklace  ###  i laughed out loud actually  ###  we refused but he would not let us walk away  ###  haggling went on for about 10 mins  ###  well guess how much we got it for  ###  as soon as we left that vendor , there are 10 more grabbing at your arms to pull you to their tables  ###  
76	gave us a great honeymoon my wife and i stayed here for our honeymoon over thanksgiving week and had a great time  ###  although the trip was not perfect , our positives far outweighed the negatives  ###  i 'll give you the pro 's , con 's and suggestions if you are going to be traveling there soon  ###  weather was great  ###  although it rains almost everyday ( due to their location on the leeward side of the mountains ) , the rains are brief and refreshing  ###  my wife and i played in the pool and ocean during the rains , or we would nap under the huts , which were 99% waterproof  ###  the service was very friendly  ###  many of the workers speak little english , but they tried their hardest to please you at all times  ###  every morning , i was served drinks in the pool and on the beach without request or tipping  ###  every request was met with a smile  ###  the nightly shows were pretty good  ###  having travelled to many places in the caribbean , including mexico , we thought these shows were the best  ###  we saw all but one show and i can tell you most of them were excellent  ###  the michael jackson show was very entertaining , as well as the circus ( more of a strongman show )  ###  skip the magic show ( good if it was a kids resort ) , but definitely attend perfect couple night  ###  you could win a free vacation and there are definite laughs to be had on this night  ###  the native show was also cool  ###  breakfast and dinner were very good  ###  like most all inclusives , your breakfast and lunch are buffet ( you can order 24 hour room service or have a meal served to you at lunch if you eat outdoors )  ###  breakfast offers great omelettes and other egg items , as well as fresh native fruits ( pineapple , mango , watermelon , banana , plantains )  ###  my wife loved their oatmeal , and the pastries were pretty good as well  ###  at lunch , the hot sandwiches and fresh pastas were good , but i never ate any of the deli meats and cheeses  ###  they had many different individual pizzas as well , some were good , some were not  ###  the cheese they used was very sharp like chedday or a heavy mozzerella  ###  dinners were very good except for at the seafood place ( oceana was the name )  ###  my wife and i live in chicago and eat out quite a bit , and she is very particular about her food  ###  we were never disappointed  ###  the chinese restaraunt has most of the staple foods ( eggs rolls , sweet and sour chicken ) and some other items that were very good as well  ###  the sushi on the first night was good , but the second time we ate there it was just okay  ###  the steak place that sits in the center of the pool had fantastic meat cuts and veggies , but the appetizers and salad were okay  ###  we did not eat at the french restaraunt because we dont like french food and it was the only restaraunt that had a wait (10-15 minutes )  ###  also , the dress code was only enforced if you were still wearing your bathing suit  ###  i went to dinner with shorts and a polo almost every night and never had a problem  ###  the mexican restaraunt is by far the best of all the places  ###  the every part of the meal was gorgeously prepared and tasted great  ###  many people we spoke to did not like the food , but their reasons were very bizarre ( an older man was very angry that his alfredo sauce was missing parsley , and another couple said they drank all day every day so the only food they could eat was noodles with butter )  ###  the outback safari excursion  ###  although there were several companies that hosted this excursion , this company was clearly the best  ###  all of the tour guides were hilarious and informative  ###  you get to learn alot about the island , see most of that area ( including a trip into the mountains ) , drink quesquextal beer ( better than presidente ) , eat the flag , and go boogie boarding  ###  it is an adventure i will never forget  ###  if you are in the market for great rum , mamahuana , or cigars , this is the place to go  ###  however , do not buy anything from anyone in the hotel  ###  walk onto the beach and go left  ###  keep walking until you see the local 8 shops , which are right by the horses  ###  there are 8 shops full of local stuff there , but you only want to go to nancy in shop number 6  ###  she does not haggle or pester you , and her prices were the best  ###  if you buy from anyone else , do not pay anything more than 1/3 of the price they start at  ###  the shopping here is very high pressure , but they will come down very quickly , especially if you play good cop bad cop with them ( let your wife be the bad cop , it is funny  ###  remember go to nancy in shop #6 towards the end , she is amazing  ###  there were wild animals everywhere that made for comical times  ###  flamingos , rabbits , peacocks , turkeys , parrots , you name it  ###  alright , time for the negatives :1  ###  bugs - it is buggy , but when you are in a hot and humid environment , what do you expect  ###  bring some mosquito wipes and dont eat at an outdoor restaraunt after it rains and you should be fine  ###  the shopping - everyone is very high pressure , especially on market nights ( sun , tues , and thur )  ###  just go to nancy in shop 6 and she has everything you want for cheap  ###  the fishing excursion  ###  even if you are experienced , the waves are an average 8-10 feet  ###  everyone on our boat got sick and we had to turn around halfway through  ###  speaking spanish everywhere  ###  brush up on basic phrases otherwise your ability to communicate with the hotel employees will be severely limited  ###  the entertainment during the day  ###  there is little to nothing planned for you to do during the day , so if you bore easily , bring a book or something else to do  ###  especially if the weather is bad , there will be nothing for you to do during the day except check out board games  ###  the spa - the prices are comparable to the states and the services arent nearly as good  ###  also , my wife and i received totally unexpected naked rubdowns in a cell - like room  ###  it was very uncomfortable , but made for a great story  ###  suggestions for future travelers :1  ###  bring bug wipes for the evenings  ###  see all the shows but the magic show ( circus is also optional )3  ###  bring something to do for a rainy day  ###  bring any medical supplies you might need ( feminine products , headaches , stomachaches , etc ) they are expensive here  ###  visit nancy in shop #66  ###  above all , just relax , your on vacation  ###  so many people were so uptight about the stupidest things when any problem you had could be instantly fixed by ordering another meal or getting another drink  ###  
76	our attitudes determined our outcome  ###  we were at the gbpb march 1 - 8  ###  having read everything posted on ta , and asked members many questions , we were well - armed with information  ###  it was important for us to know what we may be facing , as it was our first trip to the dr , and we are very appreciative of all the help that ta members gave us , so thank you , everyone  ###  the resort is clearly a beautiful sight  ###  there is no denying that it is one of the most beautiful resorts in the area  ###  we checked out several , and were pleased with our choice  ###  i will agree with what everyone has already said  ###  the place is huge  ###  that is a fact  ###  it is well manicured , clean , and aesthetically perfect  ###  actually , though , we found our way around fairly easily  ###  it took a couple of days , but we were all over the place in no time at all  ###  one time i got turned around , but i think it may have been the rum  ###  we were booked in the golden section , and when we arrived , we were told that they had upgraded us to ambar  ###  check in was quick , pleasant , and we were served cocktails while checking in  ###  we were taken soon after to the ambar section , and to bldg  ###  68, room #68208  ###  immediately upon opening the door , we could smell the most musty , unpleasant aroma  ###  the bellman also noticed it , as did the maid , who was at our door  ###  fortunately , i had brought the air fresheners , as suggested by ta members : ) however , this was more than any glade solid was going to fix  ###  we went into the room , and nearly slipped in a puddle of water  ###  the maid was confused , and mopped it up , but did not know what was causing it  ###  she sprayed the room , opened up the patio doors to air it out , and we agreed to see if it got better  ###  the next day , we were out all day  ###  when we arrived back to the room , more water  ###  we contacted the concierge , and they sent maintenance staff who did not have a clue where the water was coming from  ###  my husband is a pretty bright guy , and can fix nearly anything , so decided to help the maintenance man  ###  he tapped the wall , and noticed that the baseboard was very wet  ###  all of the wood was wet  ###  he helped the guy remove a ceiling panel , and found a serious leak in a water pipe , which obviously had been leaking into the hollow wall , and soaking into the wood  ###  about that time , we noticed other leaks in the bathroom , near the light fixture above the toilet , the shower , etc  ###  my husband spoke with the concierge again , and insisted on moving , as this was clearly going to take some time , and the wood was moldy  ###  they pleaded with us for patience , as they had no rooms left that night , but would move us first thing in the morning  ###  fine , we were not going to let it impact our trip  ###  the next morning , they came right away to move us to bldg  ###  65, room # 65208  ###  everything about it was wonderful  ###  the view was actually better , and we loved it  ###  our maid , quiskella , was the sweetest girl ever  ###  during the issue with the water , however , every single person we worked with , was absolutely wonderful  ###  they were helpful , apologetic , and worked hard to stay in communication as to the progress  ###  one other thing that happened , was while we were in a hurry to move to the new room , my husband emptied out the safe quickly , and mistakenly left my small jewelry box with all of myjewelry , wedding rings , diamond necklace , everything , inside the safe , behind the door jam  ###  when i was getting ready the next night for dinner , and realized it was gone , i was distraught , and so upset that i vomited  ###  my husband was beside himself trying to help me stay calm , and immediately contacted the ambar concierge  ###  the very helpful man , victor , called us back shortly afterward to let us know that the amazingly wonderful young canadian couple who were in our old room , ( #68208) had found my jewelry , and contacted security right away  ###  they had my jewelry locked in the vault , and we could claim it in the morning  ###  we did so , and went directly to their room to thank them personally  ###  this was all on day 2 of our vacation  ###  needless to say , after that experience , there was nothing that was going to spoil our vacation  ###  we decided that we were amongst incredible people , who were honest and kind , and we would not let any little incidental get in the way of that  ###  fortunately for us , we truly enjoyed everything about our trip  ###  certainly , there were things that we did like more than others , but we simply made a different choice if we did not like something  ###  the ambar pool  beach area : very nice place to relax , if you want quiet , with no activity , or music  ###  we sat around there at times , but usally went over to the volleyball area , golden pool area , or beach bars  ###  lots to do , entertainment , activity , etc  ###  the ala carte restaurants : we ate at don pablos , which we really liked , legourmet ,  ###  , portofino , definately not for us , but we 're kind of fussy eaters , the garden grill , which was good , but not something we wanted twice  ###  everyone has different tastes , so it 's tough to say if a place is good or not good  ###  however , we really enjoyed the buffet off the ambar lobby  ###  it was always fantastic , and the food was hot  ###  i had grilled shrimp , and/or grilled lobster nearly every day  ###  the animacion team : wonderful group  ###  they work so hard , and really try to include anyone who looks like they want to have fun  ###  my husband and i are volleyball enthusiasts , and we were watching a large group of europeans form teams for a tournament  ###  one of the animacion staff saw us watching , and included us in the game  ###  the other players spoke little or no english , and we speak no french , but we all spoke volleyball  ###  by the way , our team took 1st place : ) we received medals , and bottles of rum  ###  entertainment : in general , we enjoyed it  ###  they work hard , and really are trying to please everyone  ###  we appreciated their work  ###  we enjoyed some incredible excursions , and we found a friend in wilkins , from the vip tour service  ###  he was great , and helpful no matter what  ###  one thing that i have to say , is that some very nice people on ta , like brenda lee - alberta , john brooklin , punta cana mike , and many , many others gave some of the best advice of all : go down there with a positive attitude , and a plan to have a great time , and it will  ###  be a wonderful trip  ###  thank you all for helping to make our vacation special  ###  
74	sandals my husband and i just got back from secrets  ###  we were there from august 5- august 11  ###  prior to the trip , i was on this website almost daily checking the reviews of other vacationers  ###  we came very close to cancelling our reservations because the reviews were just scary  ###  but , i am so glad we went thru with the trip  ###  overall , the resort is excellant  ###  the only complaint was that the food is only okay  ###  everything is very salty  ###  it is edible , but definitely not fine dining  ###  we went to sandals in st lucia for our honeymoon two years ago , and i know there will be people that will be considering secrets vs sandals  ###  we stayed at the sandals halcyon , but we spent a great deal of time at sandals regency and sandals grande when we were there  ###  so , for the purpose of my review , i wo not focus on just one sandals resort in st lucia , but rather the overall experience  ###  here 's my thoughts on which resort company was better in the follow categories : beaches : secretssandals beaches do not have security , and vendors will harass you constantly , but at secrets , there is security guards at both end of the beach so no harassment , and the palpapas where just were awesome to relax under  ###  also , secrets has cocktail waitresses come onto the beach and bring you drinks constantly  ###  however , sandals does offer more water activities ( i  ###  water cycling , wind sailing etc ) while secrets only has snorkeling and boogie boarding on the beach which i suspect is because the water is somewhat rough and the coral reefs are very close to the shore  ###  however , the water is a pretty aquamarine blue at secrets while it was just a dull grey at sandals  ###  the beach at secrets is probably the nicest beach i have ever been to  ###  we really enjoyed our long walks on the beach and taking in the amazing scenary of the swaying palm trees , and the crystal clear blue waters  ###  service : both are great  ###  both resort were staffed with friendly people that were attentive and pleasant  ###  we received great service on both our vacations  ###  obviously at secrets there is a language barrier , but you can tell by their smile , tone of voice , and body language that they are glad to help  ###  food : sandalsthe food at the sandals resorts in st lucia were amazing  ###  it was like dining out at 5 star restaurants each and every night  ###  everything from appetizers , main courses , dessert to the salads were great  ###  secrets , on the other hand , had okay food at best  ###  the french and mexican restaurants were good , but everything else was way too salty , and bland tasting  ###  if food is important to you , sandals is a better bet  ###  pool : secretsthe pools at the sandals regency and sandals grande are very nice , but secrets has the largest pool i have ever seen  ###  there 's beds , palpapas , and plenty of lounge chairs  ###  there 's also cocktail waitresses  ###  overall , i really enjoyed the pool at secrets  ###  the cascade pool was very relaxing as well  ###  whirlpools : sandalssandals had some really nice large and warm whirlpools located throughout their resorts  ###  it was very relaxing to sit in them at night  ###  however , the whirlpools at secrets were very small and the water was not warm at all  ###  but , secrets does offer jucuzzis in all the rooms , so that makes up for it somewhat  ###  but we really enjoyed the whirlpools at sandals and we were disappointed that the whirlpools at secrets were not as nice  ###  ambience/resort grounds : secretssandals is a couples resort so there is definitely the feel of romance in the air  ###  more so than at secrets which is just an adult only resort  ###  the grounds at sandals are nice , but secrets grounds are just breathtakingly amazing  ###  the landscaping is just beautiful  ###  from the walkways , to the water gardens , the greenery , to the bridge that crosses over the main pool  ###  rooms : secretsduring both trips , we booked the basic room  ###  at sandals we got a room that was very close to the street so we coulad hear cars driving by , and the bathroom was dated , and dirty  ###  at secrets , we ended up switching rooms 3 times  ###  the first room was a nice room near the cascade pool but it had double beds , so we immediately asked to be switched  ###  the 2nd room was in an adjacent building to the cascade pool but it was on the first floor and it smelled of mildew  ###  so , we asked to be moved again , and 3rd time is the charm because we ended up in building 14, in a room on the 3rd floor  ###  even though it is a garden view room , we had amazing views of the ocean from our patio because it is the edge of the resort  ###  we also had cathedral ceilings which made the room extremely spacious and airy  ###  bar : bothboth the sandal resorts and secrets had swim up bar  ###  what we really liked about sandals was that they had crazy and very extensive cocktail menus  ###  my husband and i made sure to try the many tropical and fruity cocktail offerings they had  ###  the bartenders at secrets will make you anything , but their menu selection is small , and we had no idea what liquors went into the fun drinks we had at sandals  ###  but , secrets does have the famous coco locos ( a coconut/rum drink served in the coconut shell ) that we enjoyed almost daily when we were there  ###  also , dr is just a very poor country  ###  we went on a 4 wheeler tour , and we were constantly approached by kids for money  ###  that never happened to us in st lucia  ###  also , both my husband and i got sick while in dr  ###  i do not think it was the resort 's fault as i suspect it was the water that got us sick  ###  we did not get sick in st lucia  ###  also , sandals has a no tipping policy , so guests are asked to not tip , and even if you attempt to tip , the resort employees will not take your money  ###  however , at secrets , although tipping is not mandatory , we felt horrible if we did not tip because everyone else was tipping and because they really do appreciate the tipping  ###  towards the end of the trip , we ran out of dollar bills for tipping , and it created an unneeded level of stress for us because we did not have access to more us dollars , which is what they prefer  ###  so overall , we really enjoyed secrets  ###  but , we also really enjoyed sandals as well  ###  you really ca not go wrong at either place , but if you like food  ###  especially good food , sandals is a better choice  ###  but if food is only part of the equation for an enjoyable vacation , secrets is a great choice  ###  we really enjoyed the beach at secrets  ###  we never felt safe just unwinding and relaxing at the sandal beaches , but at secrets , we were able to just kick back , and take it easy under a palpapas all afternoon long without any worries  ###  we were looking for a relaxing and laid back vacation , and secrets definitely provided that for us  ###  
74	good value i was hooked on tripadvisor  ###  before i went away on this vacation  ###  i could not wait for the trip because everybody wrote such amazing reviews  ###  basically a lot of what you read is correct , but it 's very important to remember that a 4 star hotel in the dr is not the same as a 4 star hotel that we 're used to in the northeast  ###  if you think you 're going to some luxury resort , then you are mistaken , but if you think you 're going to a true island getaway , then you have the right idea  ###  i traveled with a group of 3 married couples  ###  we 're all very good friends and in our late 20's , early 30's  ###  this is an adults only resort , so there are obviously no children  ###  a lot of people staying here are much older  ###  much , much , older  ###  a lot of newlyweds as well  ###  if i came here with a group of girlfriends i would be very upset  ###  unless you call that dark room with 90's black lightallegria disco something to do  ###  if you are a single guy/girl looking for a good time , head to mexico , not here  ###  but we were there for relaxation and some quality time together away from our hectic work lives , so it was fine  ###  the drive from the airport is about an hour  ###  the scenery is interesting and seeing the locals just live is amazing  ###  makes you think twice about your nice house , computer , fancy car , expensive dinners , designer bags , and flat screens back at home  ###  room : getting our rooms was such an ordeal  ###  one of us had two beds instead of a king and they could not do anything about it  ###  in that room the air condition broke and there was a huge leak in the ceiling  ###  amazingly enough , they got a new room  ###  this time with a king bed , anda lizard  ###  but that 's another story for another time  ###  on our third night , my husband and i were sound asleep  ###  he woke me up in a panic  ###  there was a flood in our room  ###  one of the pipes had burst and there was already about 4 inches of water in the room  ###  my shoes were floating around  ###  he called the front desk , once they finally understood him ( key note : brush up on your spanish before going to the dr ) they asked if it could wait for morning  ###  i ran outside and managed to get one of the security guards  ###  he came in and said oh my god , you ca not stay here  ###  well , no kidding  ###  then as i stood in my pajamas soaked , i watched while a crew of cleaners , security , office personnel , and curious passerbys examined our room  ###  wait a minute , did i say there was not any excitement here  ###  so we packed up our stuff ( yes , now it is 3 a  ###  m ) and walked in the pitch black ( serious issues with lighting in the rooms area ) to a far away area  ###  they gave us a suite  ###  another note : do not even think about upgrading to a suite  ###  it was dark , grungy , small , and had the most awkward layout i had ever seen  ###  the day before we left i realized that i had forgotten a pair of gold/diamond earrings in the safe of the old room  ###  they had already put new people inside the room and the earrings were gone  ###  : ( they said they would call me at home if they turned up , but i had a feeling i would never see them again  ###  beach : the beach is beautiful  ###  they keep it very clean  ###  they do have people serving drinks and taking orders , but it 's not always consistent  ###  sometimes they go around with food , sometimes they do not  ###  a word to the wise : stock up on towels early in the day  ###  they go fast and once they 're gone you 're sol  ###  we had to bribe a worker to get some for us one day  ###  cost us $10 it rained a lot while we were there ( at night , the first two days ) so the cushions are always wet  ###  they do not help you with your chairs on the beach or anything like that  ###  be ready to fendfor yourself  ###  the water is rough  ###  one of the guys almost got pulled under and he is very athletic  ###  i only went in up until my knees  ###  the water is clean though  ###  pool : pool is nice  ###  water is warm  ###  no deep ends  ###  get your spot early though  ###  i swear i think people stake their chairs at 4 a  ###  no matterwhat time we got there , there was always tons of chairs lined with towels  ###  casino : the casino is small  ###  i played and won the first night , lost the second  ###  story of my life  ###  do not go there if you 're like me and love the lights of vegas  ###  you 'll be very disappointed  ###  1 roulette table , 2black jack  ###  bad odds on the craps table  ###  food and drink : they tell you that there is a no reservation policy  ###  that you can getin anywhere at any time  ###  that 's a lie if i 've ever heard one  ###  most nights we waited up to 2 hours for a table  ###

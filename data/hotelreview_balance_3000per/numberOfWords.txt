70	that said , we may not return and check out another island for (1) beaches that permit more than just sunning , (2) closer scuba diving , and (3) more to do than just drink presidente beer ( which was pretty good ) , but when you 're drinking quite a bit , it 's hard to tell what digestive disorders are attributable to
68	our initial villa ( #20) was nice , but too far from the beach , so the following day we moved closer to the beach area ( #33) - due to the size of the resort , it was a good 10 minute walk from villa #20 to the pools/beach so we were happy to move but , our new villa did not
67	if i could offer a few tips i would say to 1) request a room on the second floor as i can see where the planked roofing would pose a leakage problem 2) ensure you bring enough of the basics 3) ask for rum in your tropical drinks - if you do not , they assume you want a virgin drink and if you
67	long story short , i was repeatedly told that my royal club room would be available the next night , and had to be moved to 4 different rooms before a somewhat decent sleeping area was arraigned ( edifficio 24, a very nice bldg , however , since half of the hotel is being upgraded , stay away from bldgs , 11, 13, and
66	do book your excursions in the tour operators office for a more organized and safer excursions , the scuba caribe sales people will go around to get you to book with them , they had a 2hrs snorkeling tour for only $28, they take you out on a small boat , it did not seem like a safe and quality kind of snorkeling trip
66	variety of animals was sparse and boringtry and use a little spanish ( polite and useful ) bring small bills for tips , conditioner , moisturizer and bug spraycan buy all of this stuff and more at the lobby store so no big deal if you forgetbox of pringles (4$ and change ) , pack of marlboro lights (5$ and change ) when at
66	the government had just implemented a new law and it would cost us an extra $600 for the wedding ( very upsetting for all concerned ) we said we would not pay they did alittle talking in spanish of course and got the price down to $300 which we paid just to keep the peace and worry about when we got home , there
66	our travel agent arranged round trip transfers , if you have 3 people or more in your group in is a far better option to take a taxi , about $45, less money and you wo not have to visit numerous other hotel properties on the way to and from yoursyours , plus you wo not have to leave 4 hours or so ahead
66	the female staff are by far much friendlier and more helpful than male staff ( incidently staff are paid around $300- $500 us dollars per month and any complaints about them results in instant dismissal , so do you really need to complain that service was slow etc to management ) we made a point at the end of our holiday to tip females
66	before , but we needed to wait until 12:30, she then put me intouch with a manager ( edward ) , he explained that he wanted to have the room clean and that he would have a bellhop at our current room for 12:30, i waited at the room and no bellhop , called to the front desk to request service and they asked
66	so having read the reviews and knew that many people insist that they are moved , we did too , it worked eventually we were given room 3445 with a bit of a sea view , and a great view of the pool , but we did pay an extra $200, this was well worth the money as the difference between old and new
66	if your going to this resort , have low expectations , bring lots of singles ( atm in the main lobby does not advertise the fees charged which is $5 us per transaction + a 3-4% additional fee based on the amount of money withdrawn ) , and bring extra toiletries , as they tend to sell common products at ridiculously expensive prices ,
66	i seriously recommend eating every meal at the main buffet because they at least attempt to change the food every day ( even then it doesn?? change much ) most of the meat is tough and over - cooked and doesn?? taste very good , most food is pretty bland and i found myself walking around the buffet seeing only 1 or 2 things
65	the phone was chanrged a collect call when we werent in the room , and prices on services chnaged after we had used them ( message was $10 more than what we were told ) if the place was worth it , the additional money would not have been a big deal , but since the place was awful we really did not want
65	our room (17105) was on the ground floor of the 3rd building away from the lobby , and one building away from the centre pool?? great location , we decided , for going to dinner in high heels , stumbling home after karaoke , running for more sunblock from the pool , and a nice walk to beach to work off some of
65	we booked originally to sunscape punta cana and 6 days before we leave on vacation the travel agent from liberty travel states that sunscape has closed and she was notifying us the same day sunscape contacted her (6 days before we leave ) and she stated we are going to barcelo premium punta cana and we did not have a choose in the hotel
65	we did not have to be at the airport until 3:00 on the day of our departure , so we asked for a comp room so that we could shower before we went to airport ( since you have to be out of your room by 11:30) so we turned in our luggage and went to the pool to enjoy our last few hours
65	paris restaurant and she remembered us and brought us our drinks from the last night we were there before we had properly sat down , we gave her $10 again and came looking for us a couple of nights later with a gift for us as a thank - you ( 2 little swan mr and mrs ) look for her she is great
65	pools were kept clean/with out much debris , and i actually saw somebody scrubbing the 'scumline ' 2 times while theregrounds - really nice , pathways a little rough for wearing high heels but pretty flowers , flamingos and turtles to look atborrowed kayaks - paddled that was fun - did zip line with bavaro runners ( awesome ) cost $220 cdn - was
65	the beach was stunning and the ocean was so refreshing , the weather was hot the pools were massive , i did notice that as the day wore on the pools really warmed up and didn?? really in we ate at the buffet every morning , wide variety for breakfast service with fresh egg and omelet stations , pancakes , bacon , sausages ,
65	there was no bath , the shower did not work the sink was lower and there were no work surfaces as was the toilet to assist disabled persons , i returned to the reception to tell them that we were not staying at this room only to be told that the property was 100% occupied and there was no other rooms available and added
65	funny story , i told some guy at the asian restaurant that only good food at the resort was the dominican soup and salad bar??e responded with these exact words ?? know?? agree with you???? one of the people that makes this whole resort possible????asically , the guy , who i think was an owner or investor , told me that that food
65	outdoor furniture , and pool area seem older and dated* the large pool is great , especially if the resort is ever at full capacity* the situation with the towels annoyed me after a while ( even though you had a bracelet and key , you still have to show the towel card ) * the disco was entertaining , but the casino is
65	after few days we notice , the small fridge in the room was not refilled every day as per advertised we had to ask for beer and soft drink , there was no face cloth , we ask for 2 but they could find out only one for us , some days we had 3 towels some days 2, some days 4, some
65	maid service that did not show up until late evening ( there were 3 women to clean the room{my roommate and myself actually clean up behind ourselves and there was not any dishes left in the room} ) and on my last night the maid did not come until 5pm and then she made the beds and sweep the floor left thread bare towels
65	7) security - the security there was pathetic , being in law enforcement myself i was very dissapointed in the way they looked and acted , for example there was a girl who fell and hit her head on the beach and floated back to shore , the security just stood there and watched her as a domnican doctor who looks 15 came running
65	so , you step off the plane with your custom paper filled out ( because you received it on the airline and had time to fill out one per family ) and walk into the terminal where you wait in line for a long time ( depending how many planes land at one time ) to pay $10 per person to enter the country
65	the resort was beautiful , but they go cheap on many things like no towels in the bathrooms throughout the resort , pool towels are highly monitored , food was very limited between 10:30 and 12:30, food was similar at many restaurants , you get charged for room service , you only get 2 beers per day in your room , and the unlimited
65	the beach is wonderful with beach bars and water sports and water taxis down to the nearby market ( not worth the visit as all haggle stupidly high prices and all sell pretty much the same thing - unless you smoke , ?11 / $20 for 200 is cheaper than the hotels shops ) beach bars unfortunately shut at 4pm and they dont even
65	as i was shown the room , in the edifficio 11 ( bldg 11) , i was surprised to see this dilapidated room , with only one king size bed ( and i happened to be on vacation with my mother , we are ages 36  54, so sleeping together was not an option ) , a strange bug spray/mold odor , and
64	this is a big resort with nearly 2000 rooms in total and spread over a very large area ( which for some is not a positive ) with beautiful gardens , architecture , bars ( particular the one in the ambar section ) , pools and beach and probably 20 restaurants in total ( i did not actually count them but for sure there
64	for instance , we checked in and they tried to put us in a lower priced room without telling us since ours wasnt ready yet , they never had change for tipping , our room wasnt cleaned one day , the phone in our room wouldnt dial out without numbers sticking and we got charged for making extra calls because of it , the
64	time to access the main area ( buffett , lobby , nightly entertainment and shopping square ) and the beach area is noisy , the rooms are all the same size so no benefit there , private pool area is a joke as it it right beside the quieter resort pool and had the same number of people , extra a la carte (
64	- lots of rafts to use in the pool - 8 restaurants with no - reservations required , room service included , no wrist bands - top shelf name - brand liquor and even a few brands of american beer to choose from - an ecological park with nice walking trails and two very friendly talking parrots that provided entertainment when we were missing
64	luckily , i was so tired from lack of sleep and the flight that i slept for most of the bus ride to the resort , so it did not seem that bad ( the way back to the airport was a different story - i was very close to getting sick on the bus , and i am not prone to car sickness
64	no network to be found , i called to the front desk and explained , he said that he was not sure about the internet and that some of the rooms could not connect , i decided to go back to the front desk to request a room change and/or see what could be done , the person at the front desk did not
64	of us got tired of waiting for him for more than an hour on the designated days , i did catch up with him on the last moring i was there and he was dealing with 2 other couples who just so happened to have the same problem as we did ( go figure ) and his excuse for us not catching each other
64	and it 's culture went unanswered do to lack of understanding - i am thankful there were no emergencies , b/c i could see that being a big problem - in punta cana - americans actually seem to be the minority vacationers - we noticed many french , russian and german families - who also had difficulty with the language of the staff -
64	5 miles long , i finally got to the one lobby waiting in line , they said no you have to got to the other lobby , waiting in line she said you cant check out until we have your luggage and safe key , waited in line for a bell boy to drive me back get our luggage , came back waited in
64	she asked us to go once a day because she wanted to hang out with other kids or go on the slide - - the big playground , but we could not imagine she 'd be happy for more than 2 hours at a time , and quite often she was at the door waiting for us to come back , which just killed
64	okay , now with the negative - the language barrier is frustrating - i will admit - we travel often to the islands and i guess we expect at least the main staff to speak english - this was the most difficult for our little knowledge of spanish - we were able to get by , but a lot of questions about the island
64	upon arrival we were dropped at the main entrance and never told to go the the proper check - in area , our suite door did not lock and someone walk into our room , we had daily problems with our bathroom that required maintance and gave us many sleepless nights , pillows and wash cloths had to be requested daily and the food
64	bathrooms are in dire need of upgrade - shower head was so clogged that it only have about 4 streams going ( i spent 30 min with a needle trying to make it better ) - staff at the front desk is non - existent if you have any issues ( you will not realize how frustrating this is until you 're there ,
64	compared to the few caribbean all - inclusives in which we 've stayed , however , i would not rate the bavaro a five star : the rooms and their amenities are fine , for example , but not luxurious ( the in - room entertainment was ( for us ) , weak , with an old tv , no remote , and certainly
64	the room had mold and it had an urine oder to it , the safe was damaged and i requested for it to be changed or fixed every day that i was there but maintenance never showed up even though the hotel reception would scheduled and asked me to wait for them , what made it worse was the fact that reception would hang
64	my son - in - law and daughter had a room next to me and when my son - in - law was is his bathroom he saw what he thought was dirt on the floor so he brushed it with his barefoot to find that it was not dirt but a rusted screw ( where a door stopper used to be ) which
64	you really need a map to guide you round the place till you can get your bearings , our room smelt of damp and was like this for the first week till it was aired , small insects came out from various places to get at any scaps of sugar spilt from making cofee , this all pails into insignificance when i talk about
64	, it was looking over the tennis courts and the cascade pool , now the room got no sunlight during the day , it looked like it had not been maintained at all , the door lock was broken and there was a gaping crack in the door , the coffee maker did not work and it just did not seem like 5 star
64	we looked forward to meeting people and playing a daily game of texas hold em like we had last year , though there was no such thing on the entertainment slip here : ( the entertainment crew will to get you into activities and we did do a few that were fun - i must complain about the music they play everyday on the
64	supposed to go the marinariam tour but company forgot to pick us up - we waited at designated location but no one every showed up and we got to watch the boat drive away from pier with out us ( was told we were getting refund - will check credit card again to see if processed ) - took free shuttle to nicoles which
64	one thing that i have to say , is that some very nice people on ta , like brenda lee - alberta , john brooklin , punta cana mike , and many , many others gave some of the best advice of all : go down there with a positive attitude , and a plan to have a great time , and it will
64	dress code - we had a meal next to a couple in the french restaurant , him in a open shirt and the female in very short hot pants and a revealing top , and as for manners they were none existent , we felt sorry for the poor waiter who had the misfortunate of serving them , they say ignorance is bliss ,
64	they are arrogant and they do not us to spend any more money in their hotel and countrythis is not a 5 stars hotel this may be 3 1/2 stars at the most but they charge for a 5 stars and they irritate you all the time with a dolars , even my wife was ask for a dollars at the hotel jewellry guy
64	the staff are wonderful and if you have a nice smile for them and say hello they will do what ever they can to help you our room was always spotless and if you need your fridge filled up just leave a little note saying what you need because they do not check the fridge incase they infringe on privacy but tip tip tip
64	entertainment is a joke , okay yes it 's the carribbean but why is this the excuse for everything , it 's bad , you will want to spend time in your room , people in wigs , badly miming to music , you need to be drunk to even think its okay , we do not drink heavily that 's may be the
64	if you want to be nearby the beach ( no guarantee of view and it is not oceanfront , only side view ) then you should upgrade , you may also get into a two story unit ( most of the complex has 3 story units ) , but remember if you are by the beach you have to take a shuttle all the
64	a la carte but managed to get 6 just go to guest services and ask that does not hurti enjoyed the italian , le gourmet , garden grill , mediterraneo and japanese loved those all i also went to the brazilian and did not care for that one because i am not much of a meat lover so i found there was to much
64	the roaches in the room , the rude waiters , bartenders , front desk , the dead flies that stayed on our friends ' mirror the entire stay , the average at best food ( only one morning in the bathroom for longer than you would want ) , the 6,7,8 times i had to trip the breakers so my wife could use the
64	( btw , all the rooms have umbrellas for guest to use when they are outside - very handy ) finally sickness - we did unfortunately meet quite a few people that had been very ill while on holiday and two of them had to go to hospital due to severe dehydration , one poor little boy had a very high fever and severe
64	guest services ask for extra a la cartes ( get them to check cancellations ) drinks better if ask for better brands and throw in the odd tip , hang out at the quieter resort pool instead of the main over crowded and noisy onedo not ask for third floor if you do not like climbing stairs or elderlywhen negotiating late check out be
64	room : -we looked around the room which was filthy the mirrors was dirty there was crawling insects all up the door frame the patio doors had all hand prints over them , the bathroom was dirty and the whole room stunk of bleach , the dust was thick , i immediately started cleaning the room , we were so tired and wanted to
64	no policy on beach chair reserving , for example i was traveling with small children and everytime we went to the pool there was never no lounge chairs available under the umbrellas , people had reserved them with their towels and left for hours , so a few days into the trip we started to montior how long it took people to come back
64	we got back onto a bus with another bell boy and took us to villa block 28 on the second floor ( each villa has 3 floors only - dominican law states that no building can be built higher than the king palm tree which is good ) our room was more than adequate - clean , roomy , two double beds , table
64	the one restarant i didnt like was el marin , they do a lunch buffy everyday next to the beach and there are alot of flys and birds landing on tables and food and i saw a bird poo on the restarant floor which put me off my meal , we also all got the runs for about 8 of the days we were
64	down the path to the bg rest - not covered ) did not go to seafood restaurantamerican grill - tex mex - - great food ( veal tenderloin was hubbys fav ) again same type of mis - management as de mario - one night we waited outside untill 630 cuz they were seting tables , but were told the 'cooker had not shown
64	if you are planning to get married there dont , there seems to be alot of little catches , we thought we had all the legal fees and money owing all paid in full , to start with could not locate the wedding coordinator or get her to return calls for a day and ahalf , when we did find her she informed us
64	there are guests at the hotel that tip constantly , for every drink ordered , for daily chamber service , for room service for everything , this really has created expectations from the staff for tips for doing their jobs , like i say we tip for good service but should not have to feel pressured to do so , and it certainly should
64	entertainment , poor , when we went to jamaica , riu ocho rios entertainment was 1st class , and i thought food was not that great there , in comparison to majestic it was a 5 * : ) please do not get discouraged , noone has died there from starvation , there is plenty you can find to eat , it 's just
64	and the same girl who told us to go to the bar tried to get the booking slip from us and when i refused to hand it over was very indignant with us , the next morning we were offered in compensation spa treatments at a reduced rate but when we tried to get them , they said they knew nothing about the offer
64	however , it depends what things are important to you and to us , room which by the way was just okay nothing great , service at the pool area and bars and booking restaurants once for your whole vacation like we were able to do at iberostar who also had staff available to serve you drinks are important and this resort just did
64	we requested full refund and after 2 month of arguments we were refunded 2 days ' cost , and offered $100 credit by gogo if booked thru themplease note there are so many great hotels in punta cana , this one should be avoided at any costs ( it took us 3 weeks just to recuperate and endless comunications with gogo to get
64	( i 'm not a vegetarian so did not matter to me - but if i had been - i probably would have stronger words to say ) the gourmet restaurants - the french restaurant - food was good ( would not class as a la carte - however ) we went twice ( due to a 2 week stay ) on our first
64	and we didnt get the free room upgrade or drinks on arrival which i thought we would , so overall i wasnt that impressed but its like i said , people exspect differant things and for the money we could have had a better holiday at another resort like the riu just down the beach we had a look and that and that had
64	below is what happened to me :11/24 - booked this hotel 11/25 - money withdrawn for 2 week stay11/30 - tried to get another room , but was told that hotel is overbooked , however my room is confirmed and hotel is waiting for my arrival12/01 - provided hotel with my flight information 12/05 - received phone call that hotel is overbooked and my
64	the staff : - they were lovely and so friendly , santa in the paris restaurant is a treasure , she could not do enough for us she was great , we gave her a $10 tip cause we were into our 4th or 5th day and she was by far the friendliest member of staff we had met , we returned to
64	i must say that we were not impress with this hotel or it?? hospitality , this place is overrated and not what i was expecting , me being a returning vacationer in punta cana was disappointed with the food the activities and the hospitality the casino and the staff , so far i think that the ivero star is not as nice as the
64	after a few heated words the night manager apeared from nowhere , he then got us in to the italian resturant ordered our meal which was the pork loin cut straight in to check and blood come running out no joy again with the resteraunt manager all intal we did not eat evening meals for 6 night out of the 14 because the food
64	my 4 yr old had to use the bathroom when we were by the pool one day , so i rushed her to the nearest poolside restroom , there was only two stalls both toilets were clogged one with bo and the other with multiple tampons and urine , the bathroom stunk and was filthy , i ran out carrying the baby yelling for
64	not a problem and understandable , we went to the front desk and after explaining that the towels were never in our room did manage to get the cards and then return to the towel hut and trade the card for towels , so if you are in this category of room might be useful to make sure either the yellow beach towels (
64	here are some of the situations that we found with this room : room was toxic with mildew and moldroom was not readyno sheets on the bedno towels in bathroomtoilet brokenromantic package was not immediately providedno coffee potno lock on safeno remote control for tvi called the front desk and complained and within a few minuets , some one came and put clean sheets
64	we were eventually moved into rooms prepared for honey mooners by mistake and were pleased we were not there on honeymoon - the way the room is prepared for honeymooners is very cheap and cheerful - a cheap bottle of sparkling wine , a few petals and a plate of unexciting fruit including a pear which was never going to ripen no matter how
64	the rooms were pretty big , all marble floors , stucco walls and columns painted in faded tropical colors , darkwood white - washed bar and bathroom , a big two - person jacuzzi tub , large sliding glass doors overlooking the pool , a marble shower , double sinks , oft - restocked mini bar , and a 4- post canopy bed that
64	wanted to get to hard rock cafe at the end ( to get some stable food ) however could not peice together enough information from the 6 people we asked about the 'free shuttle ' to the 'plaza del mar shopping centre ' which may or may not pick up a couple times a day we tried to enjoy oursevles but in the end
64	early monday morning , a flyer was distributed to every room in the resort asking guests if they would be interested in a free excursion to visit isla saona , altos de chavon , stay at the gran bahia principe la samana for one night , get a free upgrade to club diamond ( adults only ) or hacienda ( with children ) ,
64	we spoke with one other couple that was traveling from new york and her husband reportedly had a screw in one of his meals ( i personally did not have a problem with most of the food ) the activities staff was practically nonexistent or maybe they were just dead tired for they had no enthusiam about the job ( at least that 's
64	on opening the fridge i found a bottle of champagne with 2 chilled glasses , although this to me did not mean all was forgiven it was a nice gesture but i must admit i phoned reception to make sure that we would not be getting billed for it as i thought someone may have made a mistake as it 's a long time
64	we had problems with the water draining away from the drain in the shower and had water all over the floor , the faucets were not put on so you had to be careful turning water on ( this goes for the public washrooms as well ) , there were cracks in the walls and we did have visitors at night even though we
64	this resort has the best equipped/maintained facility i have ever used at a resort ( health club quality , with 2 recumbent bikes , 2 upright bikes , 4 treadmills , several elliptical trainers , dumbbells , smith machine , pec , shoulder , and abdominal , and lower body machines , and several multi - station machines for lats , shoulders , arms
64	on departure from hotel puerto tours bus was scheduled to pick us up to the airport at 8:30 am and after multiple calls finally arrived to the hotel at 9:25am causing us quite a fear of missing the plane ( flight scheduled at 11:25 and route to hotel about 30 minutes ) , by the time we entered airport our plane was finishing boarding
64	i tried 3 times to get the calling card to work , it never did , and was told that we would not be charged as no call was actually made - -we ended up just using our cell phones - -upon check out , we were charged and told that it did not matter what we had been told and had to pay
64	upon check - in our friends ended up having their upgraded bracelets available and for some reason we had regular bracelets ( even though we had been the ones complaining ) when i mentioned my email with laura no one had any idea who i was talking about and i never did get to meet her ( even though i had brought her a
64	i must say , first of all , that the resort/beach is beautiful - -we loved the location , the resort grounds , etc - -we had perfect , blue sky weather everyday ( got really lucky on this ) and for the most part , thought the room was very nice ( we upgraded to the direct pool access room which i would
64	we decided to upgrade to royal service the last two days of our vacation and only wish we had done this from day one , the experience was totally different , this side was 5* and what we had expected from the normal standard room , we would return but only in royal service , the money they charge can be negociated on arrival
64	first of all the rooms are plain ugly and smell bad , there 's is an ugly comforter on the bed which feels like it is made out of wood , there are no ocean front or oceanview rooms , all i saw was an ugly construction and a green smelly garden next to my balcony , no jacuzzi tab in the bath and
64	the bell boy happened to be delivering our luggage at the time and said he would send someone right down to fix our bed ( never happened ) my husband had to fix it himself by going out into the hallway where another broken bed happened to be outside ( i guess common problem ) and he was able to take a foot from
64	are two sections to the hotel the caribe side where we were staying and the tropical side both are supposed to have bars and shows and pools the caribe pool was brilliant as i have walking difficultys and was just recovering from a operation it was perfect because it meant i did not have to get the train ( which is very bumpy and
64	the casino , well it 's a casino , these people are trained to take as much currency off punters as they can , i have read other reviewers comments about the staff being unfriendly , this to me is normal in casinos , i think that they are told to concetrate and not smile too much or inter - act with the punters
64	he definitely made our stay at the excellence punta cana much more relaxed and enjoyable ( i hope he does the training for all the front desk staff so the next time it is even better and that is the only area of improvment needed ( which is not much ) ) the weather when we were there is between 27 - 32 degrees
64	about 30 min , then left again to the beach never to return to the pool , mind you their towel was on the pool lounge chair all day , so we began complaining to the managers about the situation explaining to them that we are traveling with small children and we need an umbrella , and that people reserve the chairs and never

64	we say empty billboard signs along the road and also what seemed to be vacation houses for tourists ( i ca not see how the locals would afford these ) when we finally arrived to the melia , we were very lucky because we were what seemed to be the 1st to arrive from our flight but it did not matter because we waited

definitely not a 5 star resort i 'm dumbfounded that this hotel gets good reviews and is so highly rated it 's decidedly a 3 star property , not 5 stars as indicated the rooms are very dated and run down , old crappy beds and pillows , an old tv and overall poorly maintained the whole property is pretty run down and old - looking the food is subpar , not one meal i had would be called great the service is uneven and the staff is poorly trained and uninformed many do not comprehend english the beach is great , it 's the only redeeming factor however the resort is a 1- hour taxi trip from the airport 
facilities need work we visited excellence for 5 nights in december our first room , #1112, had a safe that did not work and so - so air conditioning when we went to the front desk to complain , we were told to go to the room and someone would be there within 15 minutes 45 minutes later , the safe guy showed up , but nobody for the a/c the safe guy could not fix it when he left , the electricity went out it went out a second time before we finally went to the front desk to change rooms we had dinner that night in the lobster house do not waste your time on this one the lobster tails had about 2 bites of food included while we were in there , the electricity went out again room 3002 served us pretty well , until night #3 when my partner got up to go to the bathroom and stepped into an inch of water a hose had broken on the back of the toilet and flooded our room it would 've been ok , but when we went to the front desk we were told that we needed to wait until noon to see if perhaps they could move us to another room the front desk clerks were not empowered to just move us my partner was infuriated that they wanted us to wait 4 hours for a new room finally , matias at the front desk finally arranged to have us moved to another upgraded room - 3109 we walked in and saw the leak coming from the ceiling and nearly flipped we finally got into #3110, which was a gorgeous suite with a beautiful view on the positive side , the food at the other restaurants was very good i particularly liked the french restaurant , while my partner liked the asian restaurant the breakfast buffet was like nothing i 'd ever seen before - lots of choices the ocean was way too rough to enjoy , particularly if you 're not a strong swimmer much of the beach was black flagged the entire time we were there , so if you 're a big ocean fan , i do not recommend this resort my favorite part , by far , though , were the beds next to the pools and ocean they were amazing i guess you could particularly say so since the beds in the rooms were hard as rocks all in all , a good trip - highly recommend the zip line tour it was worth every penny 
excellence was exactly that my family and i stayed at the excellence punta cana from december 22 to december 29 of this year it was an amazing time had by all that attended we arrived at the resort around 4 am because of a delay at the airport in vancouver , but even at 4 am , the service of the bellhops and the front desk was up to par our bags were unloaded and immediately tagged and set to one side of the lobby while we were handed cold scented towels to cool off with check in was fairly expedient and we were in our rooms within twenty minutes i had never been to an all inclusive resort before , and wasted no time enjoying the pleasures of the mini bar in the room , as well as the ample storage space for our things room service even at 4 am was great , the girl on the phone said it would be about 40 minutes for the food , which seemed a little long , but i think they only say that to cover there butts , because it took about 25 minutes at most the activities during the day were well thought out , though , there was some delays and cancellations due to weather conditions ( beach volleyball cancelled to due strong winds the entertainment staff was amazing and extremely friendly , a special thanks to all my friends , ines ( my fiance , ) altagracia ( who lovingly reffered to me as flaco loco , which translates into crazy skinny guy , ) eliza and johanna ( my disco dance partners , ) sexy cesar ( who taught me all the sexy dance moves i now know , ) julio cesar ( the mc for the games and parties the restaurants i ca not offer too much help with , i did not eat at all of them , but of the few i did eat at , i recommend toscana for the huge buffet everyday , breakfast here is well prepared and quite delicious ( although i do not recommend the scrambled eggs the omlettes are delicious and you have to try one for lunch , you have to check out the grill on the beach , different food everyday , always good , and makes the beach smell amazing for dinner , i liked spice ( asian cuisine , ) agave ( mexican , but do not eat the calimari from here , very rubbery , ) the pizza that is delivered to the pool and the beach is awesome , make sure you try that the bars were awesome , you get accustomed to speaking the language when ordering drinks , instead of drinking your usual bacardi and coke , try the brugal extra anejo , they call it the dominican babymaker , and it 's obvious why once you try it the stuff tastes amazing and it does magic for someone trying to loosen up on the dance floor the disco is great too , although sometimes a little empty , but still worth checking out the worst part of my trip was the vendors , they do not let up , and i am a very well mannered person , which makes it hard to shut them down over and over again , make sure you do not tell them you like anything until you know you 're going to buy it , otherwise you 'll have to beat them off with a stick to get away try to make it to the theatre for the shows at 10pm every night , they are worth it the ice breaker shows are fun too , it gets people into the swing of things all in all , i would highly recommend this resort for anyone going on a honeymoon or a romantic time with the better half , there is not a very big single crowd , so parents beware taking your single sons and daughters to this resort if they 're looking to party with other singles hope this helps you adios amigos and amigas 
great service , nice hotel , mediocre food my husband and i stayed at excellence for five nights mid - november we booked our trip at the very last minute so we were not able to do a ton of research on the dominican but the hotel receives high ratings thorughout the web after the one hour ride from the airport we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by everyone we met i have to say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and made every effort to learn our names and greet us by name each time they saw us we opted to upgrade to the excellence club and we are still trying to decide if we think it was worth it or not as part of the excellence club , you are ushered to the club 's private lobby for check - in but , really , it almost just creates an unneccesary step in the check - in process and adds another person or two you feel like you should tip the biggest benefits of the excellence club for us were the unlimited internet access , beach towels in the room ( they were hard to get otherwise ) , and the beach bag in our room we did eat breakfast each morning in the excellence club which was nice because it was a small buffet and you did not have to deal with a crowd the hotel itself was clean , the staff was very friendly , and nothing ever felt crowded however , the food was not great it was not bad - but it was not great i 'm not a big eater but i was prepared to indulge on my vacation and there just was not anything i was crazy about the presentation of the food was nice but it was just bland i think that is the best way to describe it the pizzas that were delivered to the pool area were good but it was unpredictable because you never knew when they would arrive we went on two excursions - swimming with the sting - rays/sharks and the zip - line tour we loved the zip - line excursion the staff was great and our bus driver and tour guide were great it was interesting to visit the sting - rays and swim with the sharks but the reef where we snorkeled was disappointing the fish were very small and there was not much to see the electricity went out in our room a handful of times , especially when i used the hairdryer also , our ac was terrible they tried to repair it but it just never got cool our room was big , though , and clean we always got housekeeping service twice a day and they refilled our mini - bar daily in many of the reviews , people said they got sick our representative at the hotel ( through aaa ) warned us that many people think they get sick from the water or the food but they do not realize that having too many drinks with coconut in them will also do it coconut is a natural laxative so you need to limit your consumption i would still pack the immodium just to be sure i could not decide if i wanted to give this hotel a 3/5 or a 4/5 but i decided to go up because of the friendly staff and the cleanliness of our room i do not think i would go back because of the food but we had a nice time while we were there we met a lot of great people at the swim up bar 
very relaxing experience just returned from my 40th birthday romantic getaway with my husband this was our first time in the dominican republic , and we have literally been to every single island in the caribbean so i can assure you that my review will be short , sweet , and comprehensive in general , we liked the dr , and the excellence was very nice the top reasons why we liked excellence were : 1) no kids ( ie , if i want to get away from my own kids , i definitely do not want to vacation with other peoples ' kids ) it was so quiet 2) the staff and the people in the dr in general so genuinely friendly , helpful , and wonderful believe me , this is not true in most other areas of the caribbean the all - inclusive feature loved being served , served , served i wanted to sit on my [ - - ] all day and just be a gluttonous pig and this is the perfect place to do it 4) the best selection of beach and pool lounge chairs , beds , and hammocks i 've ever seen there were palapas everywhere , so there was no shortage of shade there were so many beds , you did not have to worry about not getting one i 'd never had the chance to sleep on a beach bed , because usually hotels have only a few , so you end up looking longingly at the lucky few who get them ok , so here 's what i did not love about excellence :1) beach is not swimmable way too rough most of the time for this reason alone , i 'd not return here i 'm a beach fan , and love to swim in the warm caribbean sea i 'm no food snob , but some of the food was downright bad and you end up eating in the same spot for breakfast and lunch even though they have like 7 restaurants - the majority of them are only open for dinner we only stayed 4 nights , and we were definitely getting very tired of the breakfast/lunch selection by the 3rd day overall , if you just want to relax by the pool and you do not care about not going in the beach , this is a very beautiful resort the staff is wonderful if you are looking for a place to party and be loud and crazy , this is not your place 
5- star views 2- star service i do not know where to start the roaches in the room , the rude waiters , bartenders , front desk , the dead flies that stayed on our friends ' mirror the entire stay , the average at best food ( only one morning in the bathroom for longer than you would want ) , the 6,7,8 times i had to trip the breakers so my wife could use the hair dryer without our power going out , or the waste of money the excellence club turned out to be i guess i 'll start with the good the beach was fabulous the resort itself , d?cor , pool , beach access was great ok now for the rest of the trip we booked the excellence after changing from another resort we booked we booked the other one a little quickly and then read some really bad reviews so we were able to get out of that one and do a little more homework we read about the excellence from trip advisor and were really excited to go now , we 've been to the caribbean plenty and are low maintenance travelers we 'll check in and the hotel usually does not hear from us until we leave one thing we usually like to do is get to the front desk and see about upgrading rooms we were originally booked in a garden view room our first question at the front desk was , ??o you have any ocean view rooms available he said , ??es , let me tell you about the excellence club the excellence club rooms are identical to every other room in the resort ( but with a plasma tv ) and you have access to what?? basically another room where you can eat ( the same food that?? served everywhere else ) , have premium drinks , and check out dvds he showed us where we would be staying it was perfect , right in front of the pool over looking the ocean much to our dismay , we show up and still have a garden view we call the front desk and ask where the ocean view room is and he commences to telling us how wonderful the excellence club is so great , the hustle is on after spending much of the first night arguing back and forth while he?? ??ooking into it? we finally gave up and waited until the morning they finally moved us to a pool front room but i still don?? why we had to pay $400 extra per couple for a plasma tv and movies the movies ended up being ok since one morning i stayed in bed with an upset stomach and my wife did the same thing a couple of nights the resort was pretty much empty so we were a little confused why there were no ocean front rooms available the restaurants were empty , the bars were empty i guess enjoying their ocean front rooms another strange phenomenon was with it being so empty , why were the waits so long waiting for service , waiting for a table , waiting for a drink , waiting at the front desk the place was empty there were a few nice waiters but most of them were rude , acted as if we were bothering them and sometimes just stood there and looked at us like we were stupid or something i was amazed i would recommend bringing an electrician with you as well because you??l need to get the power turned on if you want to dry your hair and run the air conditioner at the same time watch your step walking underneath the vent as well so you won?? slip in the leaking water from the vent we had roaches in our bar , the couple that went with us noticed dead flies stuck to their mirror in clear sight and they stayed there the whole time we were there average at best the quality wasn?? very good we spent the whole trip scared of it after we were in the bathroom the next morning we called room service one night and they were out of pepperonis for the pizza ( that was more funny than annoying ) and our friends went to the italian restaurant and ate dinner after , they ordered dessert : ??e??e out of tiramisu ??e have one cheesecake? ok , what kind ??o , we have one piece of cheesecake left ran out of dessert like i said before , we??e low maintenance travelers we go to a cheaper place and have to wait or deal with annoyances , we don?? mind you get what you pay for but this is supposed to be a 4-5 star establishment and it seemed as though they didn?? know what the heck they were doing it was just a comedy of issues from the time we showed up to the time we left the whole trip was ruined and that?? a few thousand dollars we wish we had back there are so many other options available down there , look elsewhere i know we??l never return 
we just got back yesterday from a one week stay at the excellence resort in punta cana i had done my research online and found that with the exception of the food , there were almost 100% positive things that people had to say about this resort it all lived up to be true the resort was magical my wife and i went with 2 friends of ours and were blown away the pool and beach were spectacular as tropical beach rooms go , the rooms were nicely appointed with an open feel bathtub in the room , shower in the bathroom , was a nice tough the only negative thing i can say about this experience was the food even though at all the restaurants you ordered from menus , the food was prepared banquet style what i mean by this is that it was not as hot and fresh as food would typically be that is prepared for you if you are a person that typically eats in nice restaurants in cities like new york , san francisco , etc you will probably rate this food around a c+ or b - though i am not typically a buffet type person , i would highly recommend you go to their buffet for both breakfast and lunch you will not be disappointed as they will prepare eggs , meats , pastas individually for you lastly on the food , steer clear of the lobster house it was the only restaurant that highly disappointed us every place else ( the mexican , french , italian , etc ) provided the ambiance , a decent meal , wine , etc for a very nice evening outside of the food , the resort and its people were truly amazing we will definitely go back this review was written by an ad agency executive who travels almost half the year in mostly big cities like la , new york , las vegas and san francisco i am lucky enough to entertain clients in very fine restaurants and would probably be considered a food snob 
life does not get better than this my husband and i stayed at excellence punta cana from 10th nov - 24th nov this was our first holiday in 2 years , so we were looking for somewhere where we can just relax on a beautiful beach or by the pool we did not expect much with regards to the food after having read poor reviews and to be honest some of them had us a little worried i am pleased to say that excellence punta cana exceeded our expectations by a mile for the first couple of day , i just walked around with my mouth open the place is absolutely breathtaking we loved our room (3101) , clean , spacious and quiet the beach is beautiful , the sea is so much fun to swim in ( we both like the waves ) , the pool is huge and sparkling clean with plenty of beds/loungers as i said we did not expect much and we 're not sure why people are complaining so much ( bearing in mind that we are very fussy eaters ) for a start it is an all - inclusive resort not a michelin - star restaurant the choices were plentiful and the food was fresh , well presented and well cooked we were there for 2 weeks and could have probably stayed another 2 weeks without getting bored of the food the entertainment team do a great job , the bar staff are fun , beach  pool servers always around , the waiting staff friendly and attentive , the housekeeping ladies kept our room spotlessly clean and tidy i 'm not going to single out any staff in particular because i think every single one played a big part in having made our stay so enjoyable , and in particular those behind the scenes who works so hard but do not get the tips or the credit they derserve we 've had a wonderful time and although we usually prefer not to return to the same place ( so as not to spoil it ) , excellence punta cana is one of those places that we would certainly not hesitate going back to in fact we would have quite liked to move in there are so much more to say , but i could go on forever this place is a taste of heaven , go with the right attitude and you will not be dissapointed everything that they offer must surely satisfy 90% of guests as for the other 10% , there is no satisfaction no matter what you do they should probably rather stay at home and certainly not travel to a 3rd world country ps : 1 enjoy the ride from the airport (50minutes ) , its an excursion on its own , saves having to pay to go on one in precious holiday time find the soft serve machine by cafe kafe bar nancy 's shop is the best , she wo not rip you off ( with the other vendors everything always starts at $200, and you can get it down to $15, nancy gives a reasonable price from the start )4 go to the sports bar for ice cold water 
everything is excellent at excellence punta cana we just got back from our honeymoon we had an amazing time at excellence punta cana we felt we were in paradise the hotel and service was excellent the whole staff was very friendly and so polite my husband and i did not want to leave the resort they made us feel very special we have never experience a trip like this one we loved it so much we are gathering a group of couple to go again early next summer we never experience a problem while our stay all of our belongings we safe , nothing was missing ca not wait to go back much love to maria isabel and carlos from excellence club concierge - - from mr 
the pool and beach were beautiful this hotel catered to every persons needs i love the fact that it is all inclusive food and alcohol just because the hotel says it is all inclusive does not mean you dont have to tip the people there work 12 days straight with 2 days off they work up to 16 hours a day to make your experience there comfortable so i made sure i tipped everyone who helped me it is 35 pesos to one american dollar so you can do the math the people that work in entertainment , cesar , mariel , ines , whinny were all very good they taught me and my husband many things about there culture such as dancing also there was a bartender named juan who made the best drinks there 
excellece is excellente ok so my trip was supposed to be a romantic getaway with my boyfriend did not happen that way he decided not to go not my boyfriend anymore in any case i went on my vacation the plane ride was the plane ride from h**l a family with 3 children on the flight let thier children cry and carry on for the entire 4hr flight so now i 'm thinking this trip is doomed the bus ride to the hotel is a little long about an hour , however the driver from pierto tours was great , one of the other passenger was joking about how he could go for a beer the next thing we knew the driver pulled over to get beer once at the resort i forgot about the plane ride we were greeted with champagne and cold wash cloths i stayed in the excellence club as soon as i gave my name to the host i was promptly greeted by my conceige , pointed to my bags and in my room within 10 minutes in the excellence club you will find a fully stock bar ( all top shelf ) , big screen tv , 3 computers w/free internet also food all day i must say the food at this resort is the best that i have had in punta cana this was my 4th visit to punta cana this resort is by far the best of the 3 that i have stayed in i consider myself a very picky eater and i must say i have no complains about the food i would advise anyone travel outside the u to always pack some snack foods if you are like me you will crave some potato chips or candy the room was large and had stocked bar with liquor i do not like the dominican rum that was left in my room so i asked if it could be replaced with bacardi rum , i had the bottle within minutes i will suggest that you bring you own iron the one in the room was not a steam iron and if you were not very very careful your cloths will be burnt the beach and the ocean were great the water was warm but very rough and you are on the pacific ocean if you want to pick up a gift for someone go to nancys she will bargain and give a great deal also if you want a massage ask nancy it 's only $45 for 70 minutes nancy is located on the beach if facing the ocean go to the left just outside the resort line if you want to have fun i suggest you get involed in the daily activities offered by the resort and the entertainment crew ( cesar , santo , mariel and inez ) i must say the entertainment crew are wonderful people they work really hard and long hours but are always smiling and very cheerful and upbeat i must say if it was not for the entertainment crew ( cesar , santo , mariel and inez ) my trip would not have been as wonderful as it was the nightly shows were great the disco is a must while you are there go and learn a new dance from the entertainment crew ( cesar , santo , mariel and inez ) if you want to plan an excursion go see johnny @ pierto tours in the lobby i did the zipline what a blast i will say the staff at this resort go above and beyond their duties to make your stay enjoyable and accomodating for example one day they had rice pudding ( very good ) out and i did not see it the next day and asked for it they brought some out to me right away the head chef is walking around to make sure everyone is satisfied to management at this resort your entertaiment crew ( cesar , santo , mariel and inez ) should recieve a raise or a bonus this is a 5 star plus resort 
3rd time at excellence punta cana this is our 3rd time at excellence punta cana the first 2 times were when it was under the secrets name since it is now excellence i have noticed improvements in the resort for example , the gym is outstanding and is the best resort gym i have been too the food is also outstanding and once again they have budweiser and bud light in bottles the people are excellence and i would like to thank elvira gill for all she did to make my birthday and stay a wonderful vacation the resort is a 5 star plus and i recommended it to my boss and he also loved it i recommend this resort to everyone and i have not found anything here i was disappointed in 
ca not wait to go back my husband and i recently returned from a wonderful 5 night stay at the excellence pc hotel at the beginning of november it was nothing but spectacular for both of us i am baffled at some of the negative reviews that this resort has received this place was a perfect choice for my husband and i as we were celebrating our 17th anniversary and were lucky enough to get a family member to baby - sit so we could have some adult only time we were not disappointed we had a very trying time getting to punta cana due to our american airlines flight in miami that had us sit for 4+ hours in the plane before they finally brought in a new plane we did not arrive at the resort until sometime late in the evening this was much later than we expected but were greeted with smiles from the staff and a cold towel and champagne i noticed that we were with another couple who bought the excellence upgrade but we were checked in the same way so i am still confused as to why someone would get this upgrade our luggage was promptly delivered to our room (5 mins ) after check - in and we decided to go out to oregeno for our dinner as we were advised by the front desk this would be the quickest way to a meal since he could tell we were very tired and hungry we were not disappointed and after several main courses and more than a bottle of wine , we happily walked the short distance to our room for a peaceful nights sleep i thought our room location was perfect we were in building 6 which was just a few steps from the barcelona , touscana , and the grill restaurants this was also right by the main pool and swim up bar normally , i would not like to be so close to everything due to noise but this resort is quiet at night and it was the perfect place for us it was so convenient to run back to the room for whatever we needed also , our room ac worked very well for us and we had no complaints we were located on the 2nd floor our room was nice and the only complaint we had about it was the wireless access was weak our room was cleaned daily with fresh towels and a restocked mini bar also , each evening we received turn down service with chocolates on the pillow as far as bugs in the room , i never saw a single one i lived many yrs in s florida and texas and were use to an occasional critter but never saw one here the mosquitoes were not a problem for us either we brought our own spray but rarely used it and the were even offered spray at night at the sports bar both of us thought the food was extremely good while some dishes were different than what we were use to , they tasted very good and there was plenty of variety to choose from we liked the breakfast and lunch buffets along with our favorite dinner being at the grill sitting on an elevated area that is directly over the pool we never waited more than 10 mins for a table and always enjoyed meeting the people around us we took advantage of the room service on a few occasions and were thrilled with the prompt service (15-20mins wait ) and always greeted with a smile nothing like having a waiter deliver you hot appetizers and a bottle of wine to your room to start off the evening i was worried about the beach as i had heard it was rough to swim in they did have ? the beach black flagged while the other ? was red flagged every day it?? pretty obvious that they cut the beach down so there is less area for the lifeguards to cover the waves were nothing different that what i have seen in florida and i have done triathlons in much more challenging water that this was with that said , they did keep an eye on everyone and make sure you did not go out too far my husband was determined to do some serious body surfing as he loves these types of waves and has a lot of experience with them he made the lifeguards nervous at first but they finally gave up on him and he agreed to go just off the resort to have his fun i am more in to calm clear ocean water and was not disappointed as i could take a 2 min easy jog down the beach to find what i wanted this was perfect to float around in or swim along the beach for exercise no jelly fish or sea weed to worry about in the water and the staff does an amazing job of cleaning up the beach each day my husband and i would take a late afternoon run each day down the beach for about 35-40mins this was very enjoyable and we got to see a bit more of the area on either side of the resort my favorite spot in the whole resort was the main pool this pool is simply amazing in the way they designed it i spent most of my time here as i could float around , join in some activities , get a drink from a waiter , or sometimes get a hot pizza for lunch there was always plenty of lounge chairs in the sun or shade and i could usually find a pool float without too much work i do wish that some of the guests were more considerate and did not take a float and stick it under their chair i came close to grabbing one once as i almost didn?? not find a free one in the pool also , the beds by the pool appeared to be nice but they were hard to get as people would come out very early in the morning to claim them with putting their things on it i would not mind this so much if they used it all day but i did not like to continue walking by one that never seem to have anyone using it the staff was the best part of our whole trip we have never been treated so nice and graciously in any place we have visited before they were constantly smiling and asking if we needed anything i can?? say enough good things about all the wonderful people we met who worked there we are definitely thinking about a return trip to the excellence sometime in the future this is truly an amazing place for a couple to get away and have a wonderful relaxing time 
loved every minute my husband and i just came back from a week 's stay at excellence punta cana we truly loved every minute of it as we had been told , the ride from the airport is 1 hour and somewhat bumpy , but we have traveled several times before and we did not think it was that bad and once we got to the resort we forgot about it we were greeted with champagne at the hotel steps and check - in was quick and easy then we were off to the beach bar to wait for our room to be ready everyone was so friendly we had a swim - out room and it was just lovely and only about 6 steps and we were in the pool there were two pools outside our room and our own bar that had sandwiches and fruit for lunch this pool was quiet and there were only a handful of people there the main pool was where all the action was - - games , water aerobics , music , etc the restaurants were very good too every day you got an itinerary in your room that included which restaurants were open and which ones were closed , what the entertainment was that day and also what the drink of the day would be naturally we had to have one every day there were many restaurants , including french , mexican , mediterrean , oriental and italian there was also a grill and an excellent buffet there was a particular girl at the resort named ines who went out of her way to make sure we had a good time i do not know when she ever slept because it seemed like she was always there she is definitely an asset to the resort i could not say enough about her and i would recommend excellence to any of my friends because i know she will take good care of them during their stay and we also loved the saxaphone player , domingo we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary he not only played a song for us , but he autographed two of his cd 's and i gave them to my husband as part of his gift whenever we play them at home we will remember our stay at excellence punta cana 
fabulous trip , only downfall is the weather did not cooperate so after reading many negative reviews i was a little nervous about staying at the excellence , but all of my great expectations were surpassed and we had a wonderful time we booked a private car to bring us to the hotel b/c we wanted to have the most direct trip possible , with no stopping at other hotels we went thru mikes marina , and they were fabulous it was a long ride , about an hour , and yes , the roads were bumpy , but not nearly as bad as i expected after reading so many horrible reviews i actually fell asleep a few times , so it couldnt have been too scary upon arrival we were greeted with champagne and quick service unfortunately it was raining , and apparently had been all day , so that was a bummer , but the lobby still looked beautiful in the rain our room was very very nice i loved the huge bathroom area and jacuzzi tub , looking into the bedroom we were supposed to have an ocean view , but was not that great we had a lot of foliage in front of our balcony , adn the pool was right in front of us and the ocean was to the far left close enough to see that the waves were huge but i would not call it ocean view really more like pool view we had no problems with bugs in our room , and the mini bar was stocked daily , along with daily room cleaning and nightly turn down service we did leave a few bucks each day b/c we had special requests for beer , etc unfortunately the weather was not good when we were there i didnt know it coudl be so rainy/cloudy so many days in a row in the carribbean , ( other than hurricanes of course ) it was either really cloudy/windy/cool , or monsoon rains we didnt have sunny and gorgeous until our last day but what can ya do we just took advantage of being on vacation and went to the lobby bars i wish there was more to do when the weather is not good , b/c all the daily activities , etc we even wanted to rent a movie one day but they do not have pay per view or any rentals that you can do we worked out and went to the spa one day the gym was very very nice state of the art machines and equipment i was shocked it was nice on our rainy days to get a workout in in the morning the spa was lovely we went there one day too to have services done and really enjoyed i was a little nervous about the food but we loved it all of course here and there my stomach would be a little crampy , but when youre eating out fo the country , and drinking allllll day long , its expected we ate at every restaurant except lobster house and they were all phenomenal we ate at the grill mostly for lunch the last few days we ate at toscana and the lunch buffet was amazing alogn with the pizza station and a pasta station glad we didnt eat there every day or we would have gained twice as much weight bars and entertainment at night were fun some of hte shows were hilarious fyi - the olives in the martinis are not pitted , so dont choke the beach is gorgeous but with the rains/storm we had , the ocean was extra choppy huge waves , so after going in past your knees , the lifeguard would be blowing his whistle to get back on shore pool is very very nice need to get chairs by 930am or so , or its tough to find any beds you need by 830am or so like i said , the weather was not good , so we didnt get a day at the pool until our last day : ( so sad coco locos - yummmm real coconuts they machete open and mix the real coconut milk with 151 rum what else was there to do when its rainy , but drink didnt pay for excellence club b/c we like our room anyways , and the last thing we needed was bottles of liquor in our room we would have been trashed beer was good enough for the fridge ( along with diet cokes , and lots and lots of water ) make sure you use the bottled water for teeth brushing overheard someone say they got sick after drinking tap to take a pill all the water in the restaurants is filtered overall i would say we had a 8 out of 10 trip and it would have been a 9 or even 10 if the weather was good we just picked a bad week it was gorgeous before we got there , and was stunning the day we left i was at least able to get a little tan before coming back to cold boston any questions feel free to ask dont worry about any negative reviews excellence is an excelllent resort and we travel a lot 
excellence was awesome my wife and i traveled to excellence 11/20-11/26 and had a great time we have been to punta cana three other times , melia caribe with our kids - very nice , paradisus palma real just ourselves was nice and grand paradise with the kids - horrible ) the worst part about this resort is the drive there and back , the roads are terrible and it is over an hour once you are there , enjoy it the food is very good considering where you are , the rooms are nice , pools are clean and clear , lots of beach chairs the beach is nice , alittle windy since you are on the atlantic side but if you walk to the left near the point , nice calm waters the drinks were fantastic , first class all the way the staff was very helpful and friendly and almost everyone spoke english the best part of excellence was the choice of restaurants and no need to make reservations this was a truly stress free vacation , no where to go , nothing to do but relax , drink and enjoy paella on the beack or delivered pizzas by the pool the entertainment was fine and we always found something to do if we wanted to this is a great resort and we would return one fun note for those of you going for romance , the show free porn on channel 21 24 horus a day , enjoy 
worth the trip returned on nov 18th from a 5 day trip to the resort the hotel is located about 1 hour from the airport other reviewers complianed about the bumpy road , even suggesting to take gravol pills these folks obviously do not travel much the in - land road is fine ( although the return transfer took the other road and it was somewhat bumpy at times ) but leave the gravol at home we went on - line and found a local company ( viator ) that arranges ground transportation it is considerably more affordable then anything the hotel can book for you while the risk is you will stop at other properties along the way our trip to the resort had two other couples , one staying at the dreams next store and the other like ourselves going to the excellence returning to the airport we were by ourselves the total return cost for two was about us$86 in using this service though note : once outside of the airport you will have to make contact with most likely cocotours in one of the booths they will attempt to commit you to attend a time share presentation if you have no interest simply state that and they will then take you to the vehicle at the hotel 24 hours prior to departure you must re - confrim your ground transportation they have representatives on - site for this at the booths just off the main lobby there is no need to be prepared for a war with mosquitos as there were none perhaps they 've moved on the property is isolated and is one of 3-4 properties in the area unless you have rented a car do not plan on leaving the property for any night life as there is not any place to really go unless you drive back to the main hotel strip probably 45 minutes to an hour away the hotel entertainment is varied each night , it is enjoyable but you wo not be confused with a vegas show the property does have a casino ( we are told ) but it was closed for renovations in booking for a stay over the next month or so i 'd check to see if it has re - opened if this is important to you as many others have stated the beach is unbelievable they have lots of lounge chairs and even a number of beds to enjoy the beach to my knowledge though there is no bar service on the beach ( at least i did not see any ) yes the beach is on the atlantic side but what this really means is that you will experience great waves for body surfing or simply to enjoy there is no sea - weed or rocks , the water is clean and warmer than the pools because of the waves the hotel monitors the water ( actually has a staff person with a whistle walking the beach ) and will place flags along usually the northern portion of the beach to tell you its off limits for swimming simply move in a southern direction and you will be able to swim ( about 1/2 of the hotel beach front is swimable hotel pool is unique it winds its way along much of the beach front and in total is likely 1/4 - 1/2 mile in length as the pictures in the tour books show it fronts some of the buildings and winds around some of the restaurants of course there is a swim up bar albeit it is in a back area the one complaint i have with the entire pool set up is ( and this happens far to much at resorts ) is that people seemingly get up incredibly early to go out and reserve their lounge chairs one morning i wondered down poolside at 7:45am note : the pool does not officially open until 8:00am and there was virtually no chairs available as everyone had towels and in some cases bags/books reserving their particular spot for use later in the day it was manageable but still the hotel needs to deal with this common problem better ( note : true 5 stars that we have stayed at do manage it ) the rooms were more than adequate although we were in building four on the ground floor across from the elevator and housekeeping staff storage room if you retire early expect to hear the elevator as the late night folks return to their rooms also in the morning the housekeeping staff show up around 7:45am and tend to chat and make noise i would not recommend anyone staying near the elevators in any building the food was fine not always 5 star but more than acceptable our favourites were the grill house and the italian i heard the lobster was iffy but if you go there the advice we heard was to order your lobster grilled anyone though who suggests that the food across the board is poor is either naive of all inclusives , expecting food of a $4000/week property including premium wines at half the price , incredibly picky or born to complain , aka they are likely people that are not happy unless they are unhappy the property does not have a lunch hut around the pool so you either have go to one of the restaurants ( we usually went to the grill house near the pool area and had them make up hamburgers for take - out ) but we quickly learned the hotel staff serve pizza pool side its quite good like all resorts if you take care of the serving staff by giving them a respectible tip ( we tipped us$5-10/day ) they will take care of you each day we had a smililng and attentive server happily bring us drinks poolside and in some cases without us even having to order as i said , take care of them and they will definitely take care of you and it will make for a more enjoyable trip do not forget housekeeping , buffet and restaurant staff either a recent article read in a toronto ontario daily newspaper praised the dr for raising the bar as a destination resort and indicated ther top three hotels and the excellence was one of the top three while i would not call excellence punta cana an all around 5 star resort , for the money it is certainly a 4 star with some aspects of the experience a 5 star enjoy your vacation 
4th time and still 5 star to us sorry for a late post me and my husband spent 10 days from septmeber 3 to september 12 we go to punta cana 2 times a year this is our 4th trip to excellence and this was one of the best trips when we arrived we were greated wiht a warm smile , drink and wisk away to the excellence club to our suprise we where upgraded to an excellence ocean view suite beautiful room , the maid was great always leaving little towel figures and the the gentleman he stocked our fridge was great we ended up calling him kit kat man he was always leaving extra kit kats for my husband room service was great the pool was wonderfull never had an issue with getting a bed or floats juan and felix are top notch service around the pool juan got to know us that when we where at the pool he knew what we drank and brought it to us very attentive food was good i am a picky eater but was able to find something to eat if you get a chance and want to get gifts go over to judys she is on the right hand side of the resort on the beach she does not hassel you we got alot of good gifts at a cheap price she speaks very good english if you are looking for a very romantic quiet place to be with the one you love this is the place we do tip well when we are there , and we take school supplies , toys for the kids we give them to the maid i always take gifts for the maid to lotions , jelwery they work very hard for very little i feel lucky to be able to visit thier country and they are the nicest people you could meet we are going back feb 2009 cant wait 
a little piece of paradise wow , what can i say we flew back home to cold england today , and how i wish i was still there flight and airport transfer - long flight bit squashed we used thomas cook , but bareable the road from the airport to the hotel is bumpy yes but we had a lovely big airconditioned coach with good suspension , so it was all part of the adventure arrival - we got there and we were both standing with our mouths hung open with awe , the lobby is so beautiful , the pictures and website do not do it justice we got the champagne and cold cloth and the girl said welcome home corny , but such a lovely touch the staff were really friendly on the check in desk room - our first impression of the room was great , it looked beautiful , very clean and spacious , we were on the ground floor so had a little garden with a hammock and viranda , we overlooked a garden , it was just the lovliest thing to get there , sit out and crack open the first beer from the mini we had a four poster bed and sunken jacuzzi , we also had a power shower seperately good tv and a dvd player room was cleaned every day , and mini bar restocked food - really good , great choice and really excellent quality my favourite meal was lunch times in toscana , loads of choice and all my favourites they make up pasta for you there or fajitas , and there are tons of other things to try breakfast and dinner were great too we tried all the restuarants except lobster house and barcelona , that was only because we did not fancy anything on the menu my favourite restuarants were spice and chez isabel and the grill steaks and shrimp were awesome service - really good - staff were friendly , always smiling , or singing songs whether you tipped or not it didnt matter we tipped when we thought it was appropriate we had a couple of minor problems with things in the room , and overall they sorted these quickly without a fuss entertainment - this was better than i expected , some of it was naff , but we had fun anyway , the club on site is good fun , the casino was closed but they provided a shuttle to the resort nearby - we did not go as it isnt our thing the entertainment staff work very hard indeed i noticed them hone in more on the americans than the brits , which was okay for us , quite bemusing actually kareoke was great fun , yes i got up and had a go cleanliness - top notch , could not ask for more insects - we got bitten by ants my other half got a couple of mozzie bites , but nothing bad we eventually bought a can of off from the chemist on site , cant say it really worked , best thing to do is buy some after bite and take it to stop the itching beach - stunning , beautiful , we laid on one of the double bed things one day - bliss you do not get hassled and the bar guys come and ask if you want drinks the sea is hard work it was warm but the waves are relentless be careful and listen to the life guard pool - normally we are beach dwellers but we spent more time at the pool this time , probably as the sea was so choppy , the beds were more comfy round the pool and the you could just dip in and out of the water there they have floats in the pool , they are a great idea there is the usual silliness with reserving beds and hiding floats , but we did not do it on any of the days and always got a bed and a float the pool is absolutely lovely drinks - excellent , proper brands , cocktails are lovely measures are lethal , be careful they are forever coming round and asking if you want a drink , you do not have to move a muscle if you do not want to weather - the forecast showed showers/clouds , and i was worried , but in reality , it was beautiful sunshine with the odd cloud burst , which was pretty welcome when it came the nights are really warm , but we had good aircon in the room channel 21 on the tv - once you get there you 'll know why i just had to mention this , every single bloke on the resort had something to say about this channel , turned them all into blushing 15 year olds - beware if you are easily offended excursions - we did not go on any , we just wanted to lay there and do nothing for two weeks , but other friends we met there did go to the seona and the outback trip , which they said was good the shopping trip apparently is a bit of a waste of time safety - i felt completely safe on the resort , i was really relaxed about leaving my stuff unattended by the pool or whatever , do not take silly risks , but generally there is no need to worry i would not fancy going off the resort on my own in terms of safety though overall - we had a wonderful time , we wish we were back there , its probably the best holiday i 've ever had - and thats comparing it to the us , dubai and the med just have to mention the couples we met on hol - brian and trisha and denise and dave , thanks for making the delay on our last day a lovely little drinking session in the lobby was great to meet you all i can say is if you are booked to go and like me you are scouring these reviews to make sure you 've done the right thing - you have , i wish i was coming with you , you will love it 
the most spacticular resort ever just returned from a week at the excellence hotel/resort in punta cana , dr what an appropriate name we are from charlottesville , virginia we had a fabulous time the room was spectacular , folks at the desk were so accomodating , the conseirge ( leticia ) adopted us and took care of our every request the food was far better than any cruise ship that we had been on before no doubt because of bert the german head chef , keeping track of all seven restaurants entertainment every night was great - especially the after dinner music played by domingo the sax player - like better than kenny g all in all it was a bargain - being an all inclusive resort - air fare , food , accomodations , drinks , beach activities , horsebackriding on the beach , airport transfers , gratuities and , in general , just plain fun  relaxation the bus ride from the airport to the hotel was quite an experience roads need lots of work plan to go - the weather was 75 in am and 86 in afternoons ( nov 7 - 14- 2008) we will never forget this one 
beautiful resort - customer service lacked just a little bit very nice all inclusive place the resort itself is gorgeous , one of the nicer ones that i have seen throughout the caribbean customer service was good , but not the best they took care of all the major things and we had no big issues some of the small things , they did not take care of we called everyday to say our remote for the tv was not working , but nobody ever fixed it not a big deal because the only time the tv was on was when we were getting ready for dinner a few nights we needed extra towels because housekeeping did not replace them one night , the extra towels never came and we ended up using our pool towels again these were smaller issues , but for the most part everyone was great housekeeping would also make a lot of noise and it would start at 8am , so if you like to sleep late , watchout the food : the food was good , if you are expecting gourmet meals , you probably should not go to an all inclusive : ) that being said , the food was still very good and there were a few dishes that kept us coming back the ride there : awful it took us 1 hour and that was only because we had a private transfer group transfers take 90 minutes the road is extremely bumpy , so if you get carsick easily , hold off on the booze until you get to the resort mosquitos : yes , they exist , but not nearly as bad as some of the reports i have seen on here my wife and i probably had a total of 5-6 bites each over the 5 days we were there entertainment : the nightly shows they had were great michael jackson , circus , etc all of them worth watching i would start heading to find a seat in the theater around 45 minutes before show time though as it does tend to get crowded the sax player , domingo , was great definitely worth hearing pool and beach : all very nice it was nice we did not have to go out early and reserve our chairs as there were plenty to go around the servers were fairly consistent in providing beverages at the pool in the afternoon , the resort hands out personal pizzas which is nice all in all , we 'd go back and recommend this place to our friends , but the customer service is not up to the standards of a mexico or jamaica it was still good though 
excellence is excellent my wife and i just got back from this resort i 'll try to be brief and to the point words ca not describe just how wonderful the experience was the staff treats all guests like royalty and there was not one exception to that the resort is clean , it 's in excellent condition with well manicured grounds and attention paid to the smallest of details i am an incredible picky eater and i found the food in the 8 restaurants to be top notch with plenty of variety the pools are clean and uncrowded service was way beyond what we expected never were we made to feel that an additional gratuity was expected for the great service we tipped a little here and there because of the extrordinary service just to show how much we appreciated the effort i have been on 19 cruises this was our best vacation ever finally we can say we went on a relaxing vacation my wife and i agree that if you go to this resort and complain about anything then you are simply a complainer and unsatisfiable ok you force me to find some complaint the ride from the airport i suppose was quite long and bumpy roads in punta cana leave a lot to be desired , but what does this have to do with excellence nothing i suppose go go go you wo not be dissapointed if you are , then when you get home take big suck pill because you are incurable and you may as well put yourself out of your misery and spare us all at the same time 
good times all around i really think some people must have stayed at a different hotel then we did we stayed at the resort from oct 29th to nov 5th , and we had a wonderful time while i would not rate the experience a five star event , i would give it four stars here are some of our takes on the stay : restaurants : advice , if you go open air , go later in the evening , when it is cooler the restaurants are open until 11:00, so go late if you are too hot the grill is open air , but my wife thought here ribeye was the best meal she had all week we ate there the last night we were there i ordered the mixed grill way too much food two steaks , a pork chop and a chicken breast spice : i really liked the japanese seafood curry and my wife liked the tempura shrimp the sushi was average , but good the rice appeared a bit sticker than fresh , but the seafood was great on it we had the combo and the maki  nagimi i don?? think anything on those two appetizers was even raw the salmon was smoked chez isabelle : we ordered off their special menu that was inside the regular menu we both had the? i don?? speak french and my spell check is not helping me here??hey chatuebrion ( steak ) it was two large slices perfectly cooked and tender as can be toscana : we ate breakfast here and an occasional lunch it is buffet style edger makes a great omelet lunch there was also buffet and ok barcelona : never ate there oregano : pizza is good the cheese is a little more pungent than the us , but good agave : outdoor restaurant that is in a spanish style courtyard , so there is no breeze it was hot , but tolerable go later if you want it to be cooler we ate there the second night and we had not learned to eat later in the evening if we were open air lobster house : we ate there the first night it was ok , the lobster was a bit overcooked , but i liked it i ordered the spicy version , which i was told was ??uy calliente , ? but it was mild at best there was really nothing too spicy served in the whole place pool : loved it we got there when the place was about 65% occupied , so we never had an issue finding a place to lay our towels i am an early riser , so i would stake out a cabana layout each morning i?? say , if you want one of those , 8:30 is the latest you?? get one there are also beds with slotted covers almost always available it is humid and hot , but a quick jump in the pool and you??e good to go water volley ball was fun too it was at the pool by the santa domingo area at 11:00 and 3:00 every day also , every day , about 12:30 to 1:00 a gentleman walks around with pizzas for anyone to have they are little? 8-10 inchers and good there is also little containers of food at the bars ( finger sandwiches and fruit ) at 12:30, every day , they also cook on the beach it is usually not ready until 1:00, but they had hamburgers , a white bratwurst - kind of sausage , there version of chorizo and chicken two or three times we were there they also had??rap , i am butchering a languagebeach : a lot cooler than the pool area , as the breeze is not buffered we never laid out there , but walked it vendors : the venders on property are extremely pushy if they offer you $50 on some item , it is probably worth $17-20, so bargain also , there are huts at the end of the beach , after building 15 it is 20 feet from the pool nancy?? is the best , in my opinion you don?? really get to bargain with her , but that is because her prices are already better than anyone else?? there is also a fake target , wal - mart and shop - for - less huts we bought a sarong at shop - for - less for $18 and got the exact one , in a different color from nancy for $11 so , my suggestion is to go there also , the more you buy from her the better the prices get sunscreen : bring it we met another couple , from ny , who stated they had never burned in their lives , so they did not bring sunscreen they bought it after day two bug spray : on tuesday night they do a dominican republic night on the beach , with all the local foods and such they have bug spray for you when you walk into the area , if you want my wife only put on a little bit in the room , as she had no bug bites all week , thinking she was safe we had to leave the dinner after 10 minutes here feet were getting so eaten alive she got five bug bites in that 10 minutes so , the beach and the sports bar you need to wear it a lot in general , maybe a squirt or two it was a great time we loved it and would return to the hotel if you want to be angry or frustrated , then you will be if you want to have a great time and can overlook this or that , then you will have a great time br/>i hope this helps 
would love to go back for my honeymoon my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights and since we were staying the country for another 4 days we almost stayed an extra night at the excellence resort we decided not to do that so we can look forward to next time as soon as we arrived we were greeted by the bell hops with glasses of champagne matias , greeted us at the reception desk and our welcome was so impressive we did not need a lot of convincing to upgrade to the excellence club service they provide gerson took our luggage to our room with a mini tour of the restaurants and information of what to expect and what to do if we needed anything at all after speaking to ricardo at the excellence club lounge we were guided again by gerson to our room i had not seen the rest of the hotel or truly experienced the service and i was already feeling like a queen the room was amazing everything that you expect from a top resort and more the bed was beautifully made , everything was sparkling , clean i highly recommend staying at this hotel it is a very romantic place to stay if you want to propose to your significant other , celebrate an anniversary or for your honeymoon there was a few couples getting married at the hotel while we were there my boyfriend and i loved the service the entertainment was fantastic and everyone was sooo friendly it made you feel very comfortable this place really makes you completely forget about all your worries the first night there we ate dinner at spice and it was amazing after dinner we headed to kafe kafe near the beach and had a great time with jose , the bartender the next day we decided to play volleyball at the beach and mariel played with us since none of the other guests were playing at the time we also went bike riding with her she also made our experience even better by being so friendly edgar , one of the cooks at toscana , where we ate breakfast and lunch , was very friendly as well the food was delicious the last night there the hotel had a special dinner on the beach and it was the best dominican food i have eaten and i have eaten a lot of dominican food because i am dominican my boyfriend and i had a wonderful time we highly recommend this place and would love to go back in fact we are planning to return for our next anniversary 
very pleasant for couples who want just a beach  my wife and i vacationed there wednesday 10/29-11/02 the resort is beautiful , the landscaping and beach were beautiful , and bless their hearts , the service was very , very , good our bed was pretty spartan , but our room ( jr suite ) was very nice , with an ocean view the meals were nice , we ate two nights at spice with mixed results on service , but had a very nice chateau briand at the french restaurant the breakfast buffet is visually beautiful , but quite frankly there were foods and fruits put out that were not that great - - for example tangerines had good color , but were inedible i tried pancakes one morning , but it was the same griddle for omelets ( not near hot enough ) it is obviously quite challenging to staff a resort with a 5- star reputation with a shortage of knowledgeable people - - but they really are friendly and i believe are sincerely trying to do their best the master chef has some very interesting dishes and is quite visible going from restaurant - to - restaurant keeping things in top shape there is not that much to do except drink and do the beach , and you do not want to leave the property , believe me the waves/surf are not suitable for snorkeling , or just a relaxing dip - - it 's damn rough one afternoon , i thought i saw 20' waves breaking about a half mile out we went scuba diving on to san catalina island off la romana , a nearly 2 hour bus ride - - but it is a scenic drive to see agriculture in the dr ( for me ) the dive was very nice , we did the wall and the aquarios and the visibility was excellent there are not large fish on the reef , but there 's not much current either the dives were comparable to those off grand cayman - - but it 's quite aways from the resort friends told us that the punta cana area was their favorite in the caribean , and i believe we were at it 's best resort that said , we may not return and check out another island for (1) beaches that permit more than just sunning , (2) closer scuba diving , and (3) more to do than just drink presidente beer ( which was pretty good ) , but when you 're drinking quite a bit , it 's hard to tell what digestive disorders are attributable to the alcohol or the food bottom line - - it 's a beautiful facility , and the staff really go out of their way to do their best if you want sun , relaxation , privacy - - this is the place for you 
honeymoon with the brits we just returned from our honeymoon at the excellence the resort exceeded our expectations the rooms were very nice and well maintained the lazy river pool was great it provided plenty of space for guesta and lounge chairs the pool itself was clean and just the right temperature the drinks were good quality and never had trouble finding a bar the night time entertainment was quite good , especially the michael jackson show i ca not say enough about the food for an all inclusive resort the meal choices were excellent and quality of the meals was superb this resort was perfect for a relaxing honeymoon to top it all off , we met some fantastic people from the u that we had a blast with 
absolutely amazing excellence punta cana was an amazing all inclusive resort the staff was always friendly and always had a smile on their face if you had a question you could talk to anyone and they were always willing to help you even if they had to go out of their way to do it the staff was also pretty much fluent in english , and if they didnt know what you were saying they were able to figure it out ( but that happened maybe once and it was our fault with our lingo ) we were never bored and their shows were awesome and so entertaining the food at all the restaurants was great and you had a wide variety to choose from you will not feel that you are being hounded or watched you can go here and truly relax and enjoy yourself the water in the ocean was refreshing but warm and the pools were heated one suggestion would be to bring bug spray but no one can control mosquitoes at night , but if you dont have bug spray they have staff walking around with it to help you out i only heard complaints from other nearby hotels because the staff didnt speak english and the food was getting them sick no worries with excellence though my stay was fabulous and if i could go on a honeymoon again i would go back in a heartbeat highly recommend this resort definately get your moneys worth and much relaxation 
great great resort had a great time great place to stay , highly recommend it to couples the food and service were great the rooms were great and plenty of activities in the resort definately willing to go back 
had a great time our flights were all on time we travelled from newark thru atlanta to punta cana one recomendation when is to get a direct flight down terrible airport delays in atlanta we were well prepared for the bumpy ride from the airport thanks to friends and trip advisor no big deal really as soon as we got to the resort we were welcomed with our champagne on arrival we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to the excellence club vip we did and i 'm not sure if it is worth it or not we did get a little special treatment and were not sure if that was standart or just because we upgraded as far as what they promise is extra you have to chase them down for it they say fresh fruit everyday , pillow service , fresh flowers we never saw these and it took us 2 times asking to get our fresh fruit not that we really even wanted it , it was more that they did not deliver what they had promised the excellence club itself was a nice place to get away honestly the food in the other dinning halls was way better it 's a great place to grab coffee in the am or have a drink before dinner in the evening our room was spotless we never had a problem with bugs or anything the power went our for a few hours the first night but was not a big deal one thing i would recomend that we did was to buy ridex it 's small gadget that plusgs into the wall and emits a frequency to keep the bugs away that may be the reason we never saw any it 's about 20 bucks and well worth the investment the water was rough and we were not allowed in the ocean the entire trip we booked the bavaro splash which was great they take you to the bavaro side of punta cana you get in a boat that takes you out to your own 2 person speed boat which you take about 15 min up the coat to a platform boat to snorkel we had massages which were great the spa is great we went in the hot tub which was very clean and then had 2 pretty decent massages the gym was great state of the art equipment but not really great a/c the food at the resort was pretty good almost everything had a fishy taste except the grouper and the shrimp nothing made us sick i would avoid the lobster house everyone we talked to had gotten sick from it chez isabelle , spice and agave are the best our favorite was spice overall a great trip not the four seasons but i do not think you will find one in the dr 
excellence is excellente you are left with no doubt as to the standrard of service you will receive at excellence resort , punta cana when you are greeted with a glass of champaign and a cool towel immediately upon your arrival at the resort the superior service never stops the staff goes overboard to facilitate your every need the live nightly entertainment is of broadway caliber ( we 're from new york , so we know the entire resort , which we never got to see all of even though we were there for 7 days , is meticulously maintained i would need an extra paragraph to describe the 9 restaurants on the resort grounds fabulous never ending food and drinks room service until 5:00am all incredibly inclusive for an affordable adult only vacation

a great honeymoon my husband and i honeymooned at excellence from 10/14 to 10/21 and had an amazing time - we were quite impressed with the resort and already ca not wait to go back the ride from the airport was a bit bumpy but it was not as bad as i was expecting from some of the reviews here - the driver knew exactly what he was doing and even though it was bumpy , i did not feel in the least unsafe we just got a taxi at the airport - it was quick and easy to hop in a cab ( the fare to excellence is $70 each way ) when we arrived at the resort , check - in was a snap and the towel and champagne were lovely the resort is positively beautiful - all of the gardens and grounds are very well maintained and there are even parrots , flamingos , and a peacock wandering around the park in front , which we got a kick out of we stayed in a basic garden view room we thought the room was terrific , very clean and nice with a big , comfy four - poster bed there was maybe a slight musty smell in the room , but nothing to get too worked up about at one point we had a problem with the tv remote not working we called the front desk and it was fixed very promptly we liked having the little balcony overlooking the garden it was nice to sit on the balcony and have a presidente from the minibar after a long day at the beach we really loved both the beach and the pool areas - we spent most days lying on the beach and then going up to the main pool when we wanted to swim as reported , the waves on the beach are pretty strong , but several times we walked about a quarter - mile off to the right to an area where the waves break a bit offshore and it 's calm enough to swim , swimming there was great at both the beach and the pool areas , waiters come around quite often to bring drinks , and there are several bars near the pool areas ( including a swim - up bar in the main pool , which was a lot of fun ) we really liked the cascade pool , which was close to our room - it was a little quieter and more laid - back than the scene at the main pool one of the things that we were really pleasantly surprised by was the food - several of the reviews here indicated the food was sub - par , but we thought it was really quite good we usually did the buffet at toscana for breakfast , which has a lot of variety - i recommend the made - to - order omelets and pancakes we also ordered breakfast from room service one day and it was great for lunch , we usually just ate the pizzas they bring around to the beach and pool areas , or had a quick lunch at the grill it was the dinner experience , though , that we thought was really surprisingly good - we had great meals at every one of the restaurants we tried our favorites were barcelona ( we ate there twice ) and agave , but all the others we ate at ( toscana , chez isabelle , the grill , and spice ) were really good too maybe it 's not quite haute cuisine , but we were impressed by the quality of the food overall the drinks get high marks too - we enjoyed trying the drink of the day by the pool , and particularly liked the drinks at the martini bar ( all the bars have an assortment of good - quality liquor brands and will make your drink with whatever you ask for ) i 'm a big fan of champagne , and i was happy to discover that the bars all serve bubbly - actually spanish cava - yum we did not partake too much in the planned entertainment - we were perfectly happy to have a low - key honeymoon that mostly involved lying on the beach , but what we did see was fun we really liked the sax player in the main lobby in the evening and we went to karaoke one night , that was fun overall , we had an amazing week and were really impressed with the resort we 'd certainly recommend it to anybody 
excellence is excellent i really enjoyed my stay at the excellence in punta cana dr i was with a group 13 of single/married females 0n october 10th 2008 i was a little disappointed to see all the couples but the entertainment staff consisting of juan carlos , mariel , yohanna , ines and julio made my trip really execellente they were always polite and made you feel welcome like you were home in the night club they made you want to party on the beach i enjoyed the volleyball and various games the water aerobics made you get up off your chair and join in on the fun i would come back to the excellence punta cana and advise others to do the same 
learning experience the resort itself was absolutely beautiful it 's very clean and very well taken care of my husband and i went on recommendation from friends for our honeymoon i reserved the honeymoon package through hotels i thought this honeymoon package would give us all the perks i was wrong apparently , unless you upgrade to the excellence club honeymoon package , your stay is not any different from anyone else 's stay we saw all of these honeymoon banners on the doors and were hearing about couples who had full bars in their rooms , a bath drawn with rose petals scattered in the tub , an included dinner on the beach all of this does not come with the regular honeymoon package you must upgrade overall , our stay was very nice everyone is very nice and for the most part , accomdating if i go back i will most definitely upgrade to the excellence club 
absolutely perfect in every way excellence is excellente my wife and i went to the excellence resort for our anniversary the first week of october first , let me say that the only explanation i can find for any negative comments on this resort is the personality of the rater this is a fabulous resort every detail was attended to by the staff and they even attended to details we would not have thought of our room was an ocean view junior suite (1106) and had a beautiful view of the ocean from our private balcony the room was clean , comfortable , and air conditioner worked fine we did get a pillowtop mattress cover as the mattress was a little firm for our taste , but it was perfectly fine after that room service was very prompt and delicious our minibar refrigerator went on the blink in the middle of our week and the staff made special efforts to bring us cold beverages until it was replaced with a new one within 24 hours the grounds were immaculate and stunningly beautiful there were always a lot of activities going on for those who were so inclined , but we were most comfortable on the beach , where the beautiful and friendly staff brought us drinks and laughs the entire week these are the hardest working , most consistently cheerful people we have ever met i would like to acknowledge some by name , but all were top notch and attentive and simply a joy to be around all week our room attendant ( maid ) was lucia and she kept our room spotless and made special efforts to set a romantic tone for our anniversary with towel art and flower petals and even drawing a hot bubble bath on two occasions out in the resort a couple of servers really stood out they are altagracia , ramona , and elefet ( ely ) , who spent time helping us with our mangled spanish and french they all brought extra sunshine and smiles each time they appeared and we loved talking with them we also especially enjoyed talking with ines who spent an evening conversing with us comparing cultural aspects of our respective societies we feel we really made a lasting friend in ines and will stay in touch with her three bartenders also really stood out , always remembering us and greeting us wth a smile , a joke , and our favorite drink from memory you must try the cocoloco it was amazing talking with them and they were all so fun and entertaining their names are daniel , manuel , and eduard three very different personalities , and all were great fun for us i would like to stress that if you really want to maximize your enjoyment please take the time to learn a few simple spanish phrases most staff speak english very well , but it was great fun learning and speaking spanish and most staff seemed to appreciate it others have commented on the facilities and how wonderful they are so i wo not repeat it here the restaurants were very good ( ca not comment on the lobster house or spice , as we did not go there , but others spoke highly of them ) we had a special anniversary dinner at chez isabelle that was awesome our favorite part of the dining experience , however , was the two soirees that were held , one on the beach and one on the plaza i wish they had a restaurant devoted to dominican cuisine as it was all very very good ( try the goat yes , i said try the goat the nightly entertainment is also very good and lots of fun who cares if they are lip - syncing for the 70s and 80s show the performers are all quite good , as is the choreography the circus show was exceptional finally , i want to give a very special mention to the saxaphone player domingo he played in various locations each evening he is one of the best sax players i have ever heard and his music is mesmerizing , particularly with the sweet dominican sea breeze and surf in the background i ca not say enough about how much his music enhanced our trip beautiful , romantic , and soulful he could be making a lot of money here in the states he always had a friendly smile and took time to talk with us too he even came down to see us off on our departure day we purchased some of his cds for ourselves and family and i used his music to accompany a video slideshow of our pictures it is a most beautiful memento and we will always cherish our time at the excellence punta cana i wish i could give them 10 stars i notice there are other punta cana resorts rated highter , but do not forget they allow kids excellence is adults only , which made for a wonderful relaxing and romantic get - away i guarantee you will be as impressed as we were we ca not wait to return oh , by the way , the mosquitos were around but easily repelled by a 25% deet repellant i did not get a single bite and my wife did not even wear repellant she just stayed close to me and she did not get a bite either there were some people who got chewed up pretty good but they were attempting to use organic repellants i am usually a mosquito magnet here in alabama , so i was happy about not getting eaten up the resort staff fogged the grounds twice but it was not at all intrusive , you just had to get out of the way for about 5 minutes two evenings the entire week it seemed to help with the mosquitos too please go to this resort the people and facilities are absolutely amazing 
excellence at the excellence my husband and i honeymooned at excellence punta cana from september 28- october 4, 2008 i booked this trip through a travel agent in asheville , nc excellence was highly recommended by my agent i had also read all the wonderful comments/reviews here on trip advisor , so i was absolutely thrilled to be vacationing here now back in the us , i am revisiting this website and am appalled to read all the new negative reviews unfortunately , i have very few positive personal experiences to make note of , either if you??e reading this , you should already be well aware of the road conditions leading to the resort from the airport you will experience what is referred to as the ??ominican massage lots of potholes , narrow roads , and local drivers who speed around them with total disregard to human life our transport to excellence ( and back to the airport ) was provided by prieto tours prepare yourself for drivers who incessantly talk on their cell phones , honk at other motorists and pedestrians , and overall act irresponsibly as they take your life into their hands prieto arrived over an hour early to pick us up at the resort , barely allowing enough time for loading and seating before roaring off into a cloud of dust check - in at excellence was easy enough bellboys tagged our luggage as soon as we exited the bus at the lobby entrance we were greeted with cold towels and champagne , which was a nice touch my travel agent insisted that we be treated to the ??oneymoon? experience at excellence ( fruit and flowers waiting in the room , banner on the door , etc ) none of these things ever happened , however it was so menial , my husband and i totally overlooked it we were placed in building 11, which is on the opposite side of the resort from the lobby/entertainment/food our air conditioning blew hot , musty - smelling air throughout our stay the water coming out of the faucets often smelled like sewage our ??arden view? room actually overlooked what we affectionately called our ??ud hole building 11 experienced several power outages throughout our stay , which personally made me very uncomfortable the food at excellence was decent , however we did receive raw lobster and undercooked hamburgers on several occasions with as many eateries to choose from , i believe everyone can find something to enjoy at this resort the resort staff is friendly and good at what they do , but i do feel that i need to make note of the housekeeping staff they came into our room often ( three times a day , on average ) and picked through our personal belongings we could leave the room for an hour and upon returning , we would find our clothes , towels , books , and other items in new locations we never had enough towels or washcloths , and our bed linens weren?? changed while we were there otherwise , i was very pleased with the service whether you tip or not , the staff here will see that all your needs are met the grounds at excellence are magnificent , always clean and so very , very beautiful the pools are wonderful so relaxing to float around , sipping something fruity during our stay , the beach was often littered with garbage and debris , from old tires to water bottles to fishing line and hooks the ocean is very fierce here ? if you want to participate in water sports , i recommend vacationing elsewhere i suffered extensive bug bites to my lower legs and feet while at excellence i wore no lotions , perfumes , and practically bathed in deet after thinking it over , my husband and i believe they are bed bug bites ? all on my lower legs/feet and on the bottoms of my feet he didn?? suffer one bite , and we can find only one difference in our habits i slept under the sheets , he did not on our second day of vacation , i was severely injured on the beach my husband and i were lying in a hammock , enjoying the sound of the ocean at night suddenly , the hammock collapsed and we were sent tumbling into the sand the support pole that the hammock was tied to fell and struck me on the head , directly over my right eye i suffered a deep laceration to my brow , effectively severing my eyebrow from my face the resort ( thankfully ) has a doctor on staff 24 hours a day 12 stitches , two black eyes , and a bloody mess later , i regret our decision to lay in the hammock that night the resort took little to no responsibility for this accident our settlement for their liability a visit to the spa the best advice i can give any vacationer purchase travel insurance with all this being said , my husband and i still enjoyed our vacation we made the best out of a horrible situation ( s ) , and are already considering returning to punta cana in the near future however , we will be staying at another resort , due to everything wrong at excellence 
amazing vacation just got back from my trip - even with 2 1/2 days of rain it was amazing the hotel was great - awesome food and drinks at this all - inclusive resort no reservations was the best part - and the food was truly excellent the staff was polite , helpful , friendly the grounds are well taken care of , pools were clean , they even sprayed for bugs daily i really ca not think of any complaint the spa was relaxing and the staff professional there was so much to do - activities all day , shows and a disco at night i would go back in a heartbeat 
sick  my fiance and i stayed at the excellence resort from 9/13-9/20 the resort was absolutely beautiful the drive was long and the roads are horrible but once we got there we were pleasantly surprised the staff was wonderful and very welcoming the rooms were nice , the food was questionable - do not eat at the lobster house - horrible the drinks , pool , beach activities , staff , amenities were wonderful however , do not know where we were to find the watersports that were included because when we went to go snorkeling - they were charging us $50 pp when we arrived we thought we were in paradise however - it was extremely hot , most of the public areas are not air conditioned which made it almost impossible to enjoy the shows , bars , casino , etc the sad thing is my fiance got very ill the first monday we were there and was very very sick the rest of the week we are not sure if it was the water ( only drank bottle water ) , the lobster ( was very mushy ) or the fish but he as well as alot of other vacationers were having extreme issues with diarreha my fiance began uncontrollable vomiting and diarreha which lasted well into our return home he has been back and forth to the hospital and it was determined that he has parrasites and bacteria in his intestines and has had to spend quite a few dates going back and forth to receive antibotics through an iv and it may be affecting some other organs we , as well as another couple , did go see the medical staff to advise them of all of the people we have spoke to about our families and other who had bouts with diarreha the mosquitos are horrible upon my return , the day i was leaving , i began with extremely itchy welts on my lower legs and feet by sunday , both my legs were covered to scratch - only made it worse i went to the doctors and it was determined that i had dermatitist - which is an allergic reaction to something at the resort she said that it could have been from the food , water , plants , etc however , she had to prescribe a steroid medication as well as aveeno lotion which worked great i hate to say these things but please be aware it was one of the most gorgeous places but the repercussions are everlasting unfortunately - we will not be returning to this resort 
wonderful honeymoon my new wife and i spent a wonderful week at the excellence the beach is lovely , and was never too busy first impressions were good , its a lovely building while still managing to look relaxed we were presented with a drink on arrival and help with our bags by staff , who throughout the trip were very helpful and friendly our room was lovely very clean , good size , very nice bathtub minibar was stocked daily and tv had plenty entertainment air conditioning was good ( too good for my wifes liking ) , so if you like it freezing like me you will be happy our room ( garden view ) also had a hammock outside the door in the sunshine first night we were a bit dissappointed with our meal , in a buffet restraunt however we were satisifed with the food with 8 restraunts there was plenty to try , and if you were not too keen on one your could always try another the next night at night their was alway entertainment provided however if you werent in the mood for it , its a big enough resort you can still have a quiet drink with the show getting in your way we had a meal on the beach one night , and it was a beautiful night all round there is plenty to try and this is one activity i would definatly recommend , although admittely it was not cheap ( but who cares ) : ) we also went horse riding one day which isnt really my cup of tea , but if its your sort of thing it was good my wife clearly enjoyed it there also a lovely pool , good temperture and clean , complete with bar again it was rarely too busy , although my scottish skin could not take that much sun in all , we had a wonderful honeymoon best things about the hotel was the friendly staff , the relaxed feel and the choice of activites if you want them as well choice of food was so large that unless your really , really fussy you find plenty you will like 
excellence great pool and service i just returned from an eight night stay at the excellence let me 1st start by saying i stayed at the riu macao last september the excellence was overall a better resort , but there a few things that were a disappointment to me excellence 's pool was excellent you could have a drink at the swim up bar , join in on the activities , but there were plenty of areas to feel seculded if that is what you wanted plenty of chairs/beds covered or in the sun , and some in the pool service was also top notch great food and plenty of it we had room service and had pizza 's made for us to carry to our room during the time of day where it is a little to late for lunch but to early for dinner drinks were made out of top shelf liquor and the service there was also great my disappointments were the beach the riu macao 's sand was white and the water much more beautiful and you were able to swim without being knocked to the ground by the ocean excellence is on atlantic and i did not think there would be that much of a difference in the water/sand but there was the other thing bugs mosiquotes were as bad as i have ever seen and the sand fleas ouch i used bug spray and no perfume and i still got eaten alive not on the beach but in the open air lobby/night entertainment area , in the restaurants , everywhere the hotel sprayed but they need to do more 
my husband and i thoroughly enjoyed our time at punta cana for us , doing as little as possible was the ideal choice upon arrival , we were greeted with cool champagne and washcloths as well as smiling faces and a gorgeously landscaped resort we were then taken to a nicely air - conditioned oceanfront room with a beautiful outdoor terrace with a jacuzzi , all of which were maintained on a twice - daily basis we were pleased by the beautiful pools which included floating mats and a swim - up bar with the best pina coladas , mudslides , and coco locos you 've ever tasted the martini bar was also another favorite the beach was covered with soft sand and plenty of chairs , beds , benches , and hammocks to relax in and watch beachside weddings take place every so often , someone would come along with a freshly baked pizza the waves were rather large , so we did not do as much swimming in the ocean ( it 's the atlantic , just fyi ) there are 5-6 different restaurants , all right there on the resort our favorites included toscana , which includes personalized omelettes , skillets , and every other breakfast food you could possibly imagine , and agave , a cheery mexican restaurant with an incredibly talented mariachi band , tasty fajitas , and guacamole made right we were there during hurricanes hannah and gustav , but we managed to get away with only 2 days of rain when our room started flooding from the rain , we were whisked away to another room , which was nice and dry the rest of the time included beautiful sunny weather , although i have to say , the mosquitoes were relentless every night was heralded by some type of show : michael jackson ( our favorite ) , the 70s and 80s , a circus , and a magic show we enjoyed these from a distance but had no problems resigning to our private room , where we could enjoy our own little mini - bar ( oreos , peanuts , crackers , soft drinks , and beers ) and cuban cigars we loved the variety served on the room service menu and would have utilized it more for snacks we also would recommend bringing as many toiletries/medicinal items ( off ) as possible to avoid highway robbery for something as small as toothpaste as far as the honeymoon package goes , there 's not too much to add to get a massage through the package , you only get 15% off ( but it 's still a great experience ) the romantic dinner in a restaurant is not anything special except for some rose petals on your table the dinner on the beach is an extra $150 another warning is that if you book your transportation to the resort with travelocity , print out your travel voucher also as mentioned , the rides to the resort are definitely nauseating , so bring some dramamine as i mentioned , there 's certainly ways to entertain yourself : ziplining to horseback riding to team sports to dancing to karaoke but there 's quiet relaxing privacy too if you want it overall , we would rate this experience as excellent 
great time , great resort , needs improvement we just came back from epc on 9-1-2008 overall the resort is very nice we had a great time i felt i really did my research on this resort but i must say i was disappointed a little i will try and be fair first the ride from the airport to the resort was not a bad as i thought it would be we had a excellence driver , very courteous the roads are bad but he did a great job it took a little over a hour the resort itself is very nice they greeted us quickly and took us over to the club section as that is where we booked our room was not ready , so we went up to the club and had lunch and enjoyed ourselves check in was a breeze the bell boys are wonderful i must say i was disappointed in our room we had room 10201 the view was nice and the room was ok one thing no one mentioned , that i saw , was how small the bathroom is the toilet and shower are in one small room , the shower is the smallest i have seen at any all - inclusive i was very disappointed in that yes the bed is hard , although i like hard beds , we did get a pillow top because my husband did not like it the pillow top helped we slept fine we also had more bugs in this room than any other i will not say it was infested by any means but we saw bugs daily and nightly thank goodness i turn the light on at night when going to the br because there was one on the toilet seat and i would of sat on it we had a trail of ants around the mini - bar and closet wall the ants did not appear until 2 days before check out so i did not complain , i just kept my eye on them i did not complain because our vacation was nearing the end and i did not want to waste time they were not in the bed area just the bathroom and mini bar section yes i know we are in caribbean but we never had this many bugs and we did not complain at all about seeing the critters so we did not give the hotel a chance to switch rooms in their defense we talked to several others who said they also had bugs , not infested , but more than they would like the mosquitoes were horrible really horrible , i have at least 50 bites i talked to about 25 people that also thought it was out of control and listening to other people talk it was a concern it was the topic of conversation much of the time we walked the first night on the beach and no more we sprayed ourselves and it may of helped but seemed not to one woman went to the doctors because she had so many to get medicine i never saw so many bites i must stress this because that is the main reason we will not go back again i know we are in the caribbean and you need to expect this , and yes there have been hurricanes close by and such but it really put a damper on things can the resort fix this , i am not sure but nonetheless it was a spoiler the resort sprayed daily for insects , which is another complaint the did so several times around 6-7 in the evening we were sitting at the grill having dinner and they sprayed and this fog just come towards us it was disgusting the bugs were so bad that night that we did not finish our dinner everyone at the grill went out and sprayed off , supplied by the grill , but it really did not help so i know i sound like i am complaining about the bugs , and i am , but then i am complaining about the spraying what i am saying do not spray at that time , do it much later or very early morning they sprayed in the morning around 7:30 or so i do not know how much is the resorts fault but it is a problem i think they are on the verge on losing the battle of the bugs overall the food was very good we did not like the lobster rest the whole meal did nothing for us you did not get what you ordered as appetizers and the lobster was just ok , not so good other than that we thought the food was ok we had some very good food and some just ok overall the food is good we had some great shrimp and the pizza at oregano is excellent the last two mornings for breakfast the buffet was filled with what i will call fruit flies i never saw one before our last two days but those two mornings people were not eating much even the staff commented on this so this may of been a freak thing the pools are very nice very large and nice they seem to have enough chairs and beds it is nice to have the huts over them the one day it poured we had a bed hut and we stayed in it most of the afternoon only complaint is there is a shortage of towels yes some people are towel hogs , but they know there are shortages everyday so they need to address this we took two towels apiece because if you did not you would not have the chance in the afternoon to exchange them they provide floats in the pool which is very nice and relaxing they ask you to keep them in the pool , but people hoard them , so they are in demand 
excellent excellence i cannot really find any fault with our week 's holiday at the excellence resort in punta cana it was our first all - inclusive experience we never went on all - inclusive breaks previously because we thought they would be uniform , the entertainment would be naff and the food would be served from a buffet when we decided we did not want to do any travelling this year and that we just wanted to relax for a full week , we decided to give all - inclusive a try we booked this largely because of the great reviews on trip advisor and yet it still exceeded our expectations firstly what 's with all the negative comments about the bus transfer it was an air conditioned mini bus and we found it to be comfortable yes there are pot - holes and the roads are narrow but hello it 's the dominican republic maybe it 's because we 're irish and are therefore used to not having the most fantastic infrastructure in the world but still it really was fine we were greeted with a glass of chilled champagne the receptionist was warm and we were checked in with no delays our first room had a damp smell which we did not like so we called reception and they changed us straight away the rooms were gorgeous the small private garden with hammock ( which we did use ) was adorable the pool was amazing , huge , with no shortage of very comfortable beds we required somewhere in the shade as us irish do not appreciate the sun we could always find somewhere even if we rose late the beach was everything we imagined a perfect caribbean beach to be very romantic with gorgeous beds the for the best part the food and drink i am amazed to see bad reviews for the food the breakfast buffet allowed you to eat as little or as much as you wanted my husband usually had an omlette whereas i had a bagel with meats and cheeses , fruit and pastries it was very good for a buffet style breakfast again with lunch you could eat as little or as much as you liked in the buffet and it was always a good selection i particularily liked the salad options we ate in the grill restaurant most lunch times as it felt that little bit more of a treat we ate in every restaurant during our stay the asian and french restaurants were our fav 's you did feel as if you had eaten somewhere special the mexican restaurant served probably the tastiest steak i have ever had - which surprised me having been warned by reviews that the beef would be of poor quality the pizza served by the pool was a lovely touch and room service was also good we also loved how you did not have to book your meal at the restaurants , you could either have dinner early or else get a pager and enjoy drinks until you were called i was delighted to learn that the wonderful bar staff would make cocktails to your specific taste and they remembered them for the rest of the week my husband was very impressed with the whiskey collection and we found the wine to be wonderful also the entertainment was just that entertaining , although i would not go out of my way to see any of it again it filled a gap until the nightclub and casino which we thought were fantastic the entertainment team in the nightclub really were brilliant the spa was amazing , i ended up having 3 treatments my husband and i spend a wonderful afternoon at the spa the garden 's are fabulous and the nature trail at the front is wonderful there are beautiful peacocks and pink flamingos all on show the sofas in the central lobby were compy and provided cool comfort in the afternoon where we could sit with our books and enjoy a cold beer all in all we left this holiday feeling relaxed , happy and quite a bit rounder but hey , that 's what holidays are for the all - inclusive nature of this break just felt like such a treat it takes a couple of days to become comfortable witht he fact that you do not have to pay for if we were to do another all - inclusive holiday i do not think i would chance another resort , i think i would want to go back to the excellence at punta cana 
excellence punta cana is " excelente " i have just returned from my first stay in the dominican republic and my stay at the excellence punta cana has far exceeded any of my expectations in all of my world - wide travels , this hotel has far surpassed the others this hotel is not only immaculate but also an architectual delight the entire staff provided me and my companions with outstanding 24 hour service everyone was friendly , and very accommodating in addition to the bedroom bar etc , the rooms provided each guest with robes and slippers i especially enjoyed the service and accommodations provided poolside an at the beach i highly recommend the spa ( additional fee ) that provided a very tranquil experience there is a large variety of different foods available and each restaurant has it 's own unique ambiance and charm my friends and i looked forward to the daily activities and the fantastic nightly shows and disco , sponsored by the entertainment team their services not only kept me well entertained but also made me feel welcome ( especially on the dance floor ) i ca not wait to return excellence punta cana truly is excelente lynne , new york 
muy bien excellence we stayed at the excellence for our 26th anniversary from july 27th untill august 3rd and i didnt want to leave the room was gorgeous after reading some reviews i was slighty intimadated if we had made the right choice well i am glad we chose the excellence for our vacation the food was delicious at every restaurant we dined at people that have problems with a dress code should eat at ponderosa its nice to dress for dinner and have a nice relaxing meal with all of your expectations meet the wait staff is more than welcome to cater above and beyond your expectations hats off to jenny in the show lounge , willy at the lobster house , domingo hehe , at the cascade pool , nayres hostess at the lobster house and more then i could ever mention we had more fun with the staff than other travelers my eagerness to learn a little espanol worked well with with their interest in english there were many long conversations with all the wait staff that were sooo entertaining we were so relaxed after a week there i didnt want to leave but had to otherwise i wouldnt have ever had a productive moment haha if you are looking for a ultimate vacation where you can do things or simply do nothing this is the place we have previously did caribbean cruises as a anniversary vacation which was a beautiful time but i will tell you this was the way to go excellente super bueno hats off to the whole staff 
excellente is the word just got back from a 10- day stay at excellence , punta cana and i must say , it was the best vacation ever my wife and i went for our 20th anniversary and i ca not think of a more romantic place to do so we booked through vacationstogo com ( funjet vacations ) and had no problems with any of our itinerary yes , it is an hour or so from the airport to the resort on some pretty bumpy roads if you get motion sickness , take some dramamine the resort was beautiful we were met with a cool towel and a glass of champagne check - in took about 5 minutes and we were escorted to to our swim - up junior suite ( did not get excellence club ) , definitely the way to go the room was spacious , clean and cool minibar was stocked with beer , soda and juices we needed ) food was average we liked spice and barcelona for dinner most portions are pretty small , but they will bring as many orders as you want breakfast buffet was good and we liked having the occasional pizza on the beach we thought the staff was exceptional and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable thanks to libeth , franklin , and the bartenders ( daniel , altagracia and domingo ) for keeping us well oiled and having fun we will definately go back 
honeymoon haven i was probably there the same week as the last two travelers being that i had been to five star in jamaica , i had great expectations once we landed o the plane , we were immediately escorted to our expedia respresentative which quickly got us on a bus to take us to the htel , there were only two other people with us , so we only stopped once if it was a busy season we could have been on the bus all day since we were the last stop once we arrived our bags were taken , towels and champagne handed to us , and we only waited about 15 minutes for our room since it was out honeymoon we went with the excellence package ( not sure if we needed it though , it seems everyone gets the same room an services , aside from the excellence club , but the is food everywhere , an we brought out laptop to access internet in our room they quickly learned our name and never forgot it the room was nice , and the minibar was awesome with full bottles of beefeaters , stoli , jim beam , and rum , nut this could have been an excellence upgrade we didnt really drink them , because i would go to the bar to have my drinks made for me there were not a lot of peple there , which i believe made it better pros : basically the beach is great there , big with plenty of chairs , excellent service , different activites everyday , 10 top shelf liquor bars , 7 pretty decent restaurants , 2 awesome pools , grand buffets out on the beach several nights , beautiful grounds and more the food was ok , but nothing to die for the maid would come in and make the bed , but never refilled shampoo and soap and our sandy sheets were not washed until almost our last night i shouldnt have to ask for ever little thing that is expected there were too many salesmen on the beach trying to get you to take excursions one guy approached us 3 time a day all week i guess he couldnt remember what we looked like it was our honey moon , we wanted to relax , not be bothered , not take excursions , but they couldnt let up there are cleary peopl in the hotel to help you book a trip if you want it , and they did also bother you at the pool again , didnt want to complain , just wanted to relax the spa was aveage , and one of our services was in a room with the door open , and we were sweating to death i had to ask for cold towels overall they really tried to please you and make the whole experince fun filled and relaxing , i believe they did that , and it is definately a couples resort , you can mingle if you like with other people , expecially at the swim up bar , or just be alone expedia also contacted us with all of our return information and got us swiftly to the airport on time and explained exactly where to go and what to do you dont have to tip , but we wanted to because we were impressed with the service give it a try , you wont be disappointed 
you get what you pay for let me start by saying that i have travelled extensively to nearly every carribean island i have taken 7 cruises to the carribean , as well as stayed at resorts in aruba , a few islands in hawaii and mexico i have travelled to underdevelopped areas in the carribean , and was prepared to encounter some unpleasant roads along the way and also aware of the stomach issues that may accompany travelling in a foreign country when i became interested in travelling to punta cana through a recommendation i did as much research as possible regarding the best resort for my stay after reading all of the reviews on the website and others i thought the vacation was fool proof unfortunately , that was not the case my experience might be an isolated incident but i must warn anyone thinking about going to lower their expectations , and take into account that these things might happen to you first off , food poisioning i made sure to not drink the water and only drank bottled water i stayed away from any type of fish , and rarely drank alcohol however , on my third day of vacation i ate at the lunch buffet out of all the vacations i have ever been on i have never found food to be of such low quality time after time i tried to eat the food , but found it was stale they never changed over the food they had a bin of french fries and nachos which were completely stale within a few hours i was vomitting i should have used better judgement and not ate anything at all , but the choices for lunch are really limited beyond the buffet of stale food , there is only one other restaurant to eat at which is a sit down restaurant breakfast was the same story on my first day i was impressed at the assortment of pastries , and got a whole plate full only to almost break my teeth on stale donuts that were hard as rocks it was truly disgusting at points in addition to the food being a major disapointment , there were quite a few other things that really detracted from this 5 star resort not up to par the room had ants in some places as i type this , i am scratching bug bites all over my arms and legs ( i did wear off spray daily ) but apparently there is nothing that can stop them a day after coming home , i realized that the bug bites have actually gotten worse also , the housekeeping staff did not measure up to a 5 star resort level they never once in our week stay changed the small towels in the room the bath tub had hair in the drain on the first day we checked in every day we would have to ask for beach towels because they were never put in our room upon check in , our fridge had the remains of the last guests drinks in it that had me wondering , if they could not even take the time to clean the fridge what else they may have not cleaned or prepared for us became yet another pain on our second day we called for breakfast at 8:00 am we were told it would take an hour we called back an hour later to see where the food was , and were told it would take another half an hour so , if you want breakfast room service , make sure to order it two hours in advance also , you really cannot arrive late for anything on our last day we left our room at 10:55 am because we were both not feeling well we wanted to try to just grab a little bit of food for the ride to the airport or for the wait for our transfer upon walking into the buffett we saw tons of people sitting and still eating , and others at the buffett taking food within a moment a man from the resort came charging up to us insisting we leave because it was closed we tried to explain that we were not going to sit down and we just wanted to take a muffin or something to go i understand that if a restaurant is closed that he has every right to ask us to leave , but the fact that others were clearly still getting food from the buffet showed the true level of service the people at the resort are willing to give he told us to go to lobster house which was not a possibility since we were leaving within the hour the staff were friendly , many of the bartenders or other staff were extremely nice people and i geniunely enjoyed meeting them however , i would by no means describe the service they provide as above average many times we asked for certain tables in a restaurant ( and witnessed the same thing with other people ) and were told it was not a possibility the tables with nice views of either the ocean , or a window seat would be entirely open and set up ( in an almost empty restaurant ) , but some excuse would be given in my opinion , if i go to a restaurant and would prefer a certain table for whatever reason , it should not be a problem i saw this happen many times to both myself and others , and it is mind boggling why the staff are so unaccomodating in making people happy in this respect it almost seemed as if the staff were bothered by requests sometimes , and after a while we just gave up and settled for tables in corners while simply looking at clean , empty tables with gorgeous views in envy the tv rarely ever had a signal at night we would be in the middle of watching the news or some other show , and the tv would just stop working we called once to report the problem , after the 2nd time we just gave up bottom line is that the resort is beautiful it 's a rough and rocky trek to get there , but once you do , the resort is beautiful enough to take your mind off of what you 've went through to get there however , the food and the service is not worth the money there are plenty of other islands in the carribean that have resorts with edible food , and 10 times better service by the way , i have noted that any review on this website that is not positive is usually noted as not helpful of course many people may have had a great time and not had the same horrible experience i had , but i think it 's best potential travellers get the chance to see both ends of the spectrum of possibilities they risk travelling to excellence many others have given positive reviews on this website and others , but a few others have really not had a positive experience at all i think it is important to recognize that if something does not go smoothly at this resort they are not accomodating and are very uninterested in helping you out 
excellence is almost excellente the excellence punta cana?? property including the beach and pools is excellent it is a beautiful setting , well maintained and spacious enough that you never feel crowded it is an adult oriented resort which means that there are no kids which leads to a quieter , more laid back ambiance the rooms however , are well worn and could use updating they were really just average though the air conditioning worked fine and we had no bugs , there was rust and significant wear in the bathroom and sink area when the toilet would not flush , they fixed it within an hour however , they had to come back three times to get the fix to work be prepared for mosquitoes , especially in the theater and lobby bars in the evening we brought off and it worked fine the food was excellent the restaurants have their unique styles and dishes and we never had a bad meal and some exceptional ones for dinner we thought that chez isabell and spice were best , but agave and the grill were also very good we never had a bad meal service was prompt , courteous and attentive the only problem was that the restaurants are small and if you want to eat after 7:30pm you will likely have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour for breakfast or lunch , there was toscano which was buffet style and excellent and one other restaurant which served a more limited menu , but still very good overall the beef was great which shouldn?? be a surprise since it appears that ranching in a major industry in the dr the fish was also excellent which was surprising since only red snapper and grouper are typically caught in the caribbean most days they have a barbeque on the beach for lunch which we felt was exactly what we wanted when we did not want to clean up or change for lunch they also had a traditional dominican dinner on the beach one night which included whole roasted pig and roasted goat , if you want local flavor the beverages at the bars and restaurants were excellent , except for some of the wines some of the chilean whites were good , but some of the argentinean reds were not you can purchase wine , but at an all inclusive resort you really should not have to the mixed drinks were good and the bartenders had no problem making you anything you wanted however , some had not mastered making a manhattan or a dry martini entertainment was a mixed bag the standout was domingo , a saxman who played most nights in the martini bar or with a band outside of the theater on the plaza his covers of popular tunes are excellent and his original pieces are outstanding we never got tired of listening to him play i bought a couple of his cds and they are a good way to remember the trip he deserves to be one of the main shows the other evening entertainment was various shows the michael jackson tribute and the circ de sole imitation were very good however , the dominican folklore show needed someone to narrate and add interest after a couple of folk dances it all stated to look the same service outside of the restaurants was very good reception went smoothly and bags were delivered quickly problems were resolved quickly and without any hassle or fuss some days there were several people cruising the pool asking to get you drinks or bring you a pizza and some days it seemed there was no one around there is supposed to be no tipping , but many people do tip which may tempt the staff to provide good service to some and not to others overall , i would return to excellence for a relaxing vacation 
everything a little girl dreamed her honeymoon to be the excellence club was absolutely amazing robert puello is the excellence club manager and did everything possible to make our honeymoon unforgrttable we had the best time , the resort was clean , food was great , and the service was excellent we will definetly be revisiting this resort in the future and would recomend it to all my friends and family 
wonderful stay since there are so many reviews i will break it down into pros and cons beach - - the beach is clean , there is plenty of shaded areas , the service on the beach is great , the waves and undertow are strong , but not much different than a rough day along the northeast coast food - - i find it hard to believe that people complain about the food we ate at every restaurant except spice and the lobster house and found the food exceptional i am a fussy eater and i did not have any complaints the fish and shrimp were very fresh and if you were not satisfied with a dish they went out their way to accommodate you service - - we have stayed at several 5 star resorts and the service at excellence was great yes you had to wait for room service but that is expected since they make the food fresh the rooms were cleaned twice a day sometimes it would take awhile to get the room cleaned , but the purpose of our trip was to enjoy the beach , not hang out in the room all day , so it did not bother us the service in the restaurants was superb we frequently had the waiter jose lois and he was great i believe some people complain about the service because the staff is effecient but not overbearing they allow you your space also , you are on vacation what is the rush with the meals i liked that we never felt rushed to leave our table or finish our meals we noted that those who complained were people who were very demanding to begin with the staff at the resort are very kind , accommodating and humble while it is not mandatory to tip , we took $100 in one dollar bills and tipped the staff often the staff never looked or waited for the tip but they were very appreciative when they received a tip we did not pay extra for the excellence club , but it did not make a difference the check in was very quick our bags were in our room within 15 minutes and the mini bar was replenished daily also the private beach for the excellence club is literally a section on the beach in between the rest of the chairs it is the same exact beach and view if you prefer a quiet portion of the hotel ask for a room away from the pool the air condition in our room did not work well the last day we found out that you had to make sure the slider in your room was shut tight , not just locked , because there is a magnetic strip that when not connected , shuts off the air yes , the ride is bumpy but if you get past the fact that it is rough , you should sit back and enjoy the beautiful scenery several people complained about the entertainment in the previous reviews if you are looking for a broadway performance then you will be disappointed however if you have the mindset that the performers truly enjoy their job and work hard to entertain you , you can sit back , relax and be entertained we went every night and kept things in perspective , thus we were able to have a drink and enjoy the show highly recommend this resort for a relaxing getaway 
worst vacation ever we went for friends wedding the only good thing was that we did not pick the place while the staff did attempt to keep everyone happy and the grounds were nice , the food was a 1 out of 10 the surrounding areas were terrible and the off campus tours were really far and expensive for what you rec 'd i would never even consider stepping foot in that country again not even if my life depended upon it 
family vacation we just spent 5 days at excellence at punta cana most of the people who work at the hotel were very pleasant jackeline at the desk , ramon , a server , libeth , a hostess , edwardo , a bell person , christian a server at the beach , were exceptional the staff is clearly well trained always saying ola and smiling and making room for you in the hall ways and such the food was not outstanding , but , plentiful and good enough with spice and the barcelona restaurants being the best the wine was decent the nightly entertainment was nice , but after 3 nights a bit of the same thing the pool is extraordinary in that one really can just roll along on floats nearly the length of the hotel with curves and islands and a swim - up bar the beach front is magnificent the water is pristine , the temperature perfect with enough waves to have fun and little tidal pools to make a more timid swimmer feel comfortable the horseback riding was awesome it 's a nice ride through a wooded area and along the beach the spa was nice the marine - scrub massage with esmeralda was great , but a facial was not worth the $$$ the hotel has an open feeling that is very clean and attractive the rooms were spacious , very clean with very firm beds some little things i noticed : a lamp did not work a small chip on the counter stuff to make coffee , but no coffee maker they were quickly ameliorated if you called the front desk internet service was not available in the room and barely in the lobby area this hotel is an hour from the airport the ride is not pleasant with lots of pot holes and poor roads departure is a bit of an experience one line after another with hours of standing despite that , it was nice to be away from hotel row you can easily stay 4-5 days here with all the activities , restaurants , beach and bars and have a lovely , relaxing vacation tips are greatly appreciated despite this being all inclusive 
great honeymoon at excellence my husband and i visited excellence for our honeymoon june 8-13th and had a truly fabulous time after reading some of the reviews , i was a little nervous , but luckily i had no reason to be we were in building 10 at the far end of the property when we got to our room , we grabbed a beer from the stocked mini - fridge and went to sit on one of our two balconies unfortunately , the air conditioning in that room was not working , so the bagboy called the front desk and someone came right up to work on it we got dressed for dinner , went to agave , and came back to the room the a/c still was not working , so we went down to the front desk , and the manager moved us right away to the room next door he was so friendly and willing to resolve our problem it was the exact same kind of room , and we stayed there the rest of the trip food : food was one of the things i was the most worried about from the other reviews i am not particularly picky , so i figured i would be fine i was more than fine maybe some people do not like ceviche , chateaubriand , gnocchi , paella , and risotto , but i sure do we ate at agave , chez isabelle , toscana , the grill for lunches , and barcelona our favorite was probably barcelona , but we ate at toscana twice because they had such a large menu and we wanted to try more dishes breakfast was a massive buffet with everything from omelettes to fresh fruit smoothies to make - your - own bloody marys to an assortment of meats and cheeses we usually took the opportunity to get off the beach , change out of our swimsuits , and go to the grill ( a la carte vs buffet at toscana ) for lunch we had room service for breakfast one morning as part of our honeymoon package , and they came right on time with champagne the room itself was nothing to write home about the jacuzzi tub is nice , as is the big bed the mattress is a little firmer than most americans are probably used to our balcony , however , had another jacuzzi , several chaise lounges , and a round bed - type lounge with an ocean - view we enjoyed coming in from the pool and having a beer out on our balcony before showering and dressing for dinner we really did not want to play volleyball or take dancing lessons or anything , so being on the edge of the property was perfect it was quiet and relaxing where we were , and there were plenty of palapas , hammocks , etc my husband and i would walk down the beach every day to the part of the beach where we could just sort of drift in the ocean ( thanks for the tip other ta reviews there was occasional drink service on the beach , and if we really wanted something , we were not far from the bar by the pool after lunch , we would come back to the room if we left our swimsuits outside , they would be dry then we would head to the pool by this time , most people would have gone in , so we were able to snatch up some floats the pool is gorgeous , and we loved just floating around lying on that float , staring up at a perfectly blue sky and palm trees felt like heaven we were all prepared for mosquito issues , and we did not have any problems at all maybe this depends on the wind and the weather my husband and i are both well - traveled , and this was the nicest ai either of us have stayed in the drinks are call liquor , and they will make you anything i kept expecting the bartenders to be like , no , you ca not have that we drank a lot of champagne , mojitos , jack on the rocks , coco - locos , etc people generally seem to be well - behaved the rowdiest i saw were at the pool bar , and they were not too bad the rooms are not a typical 5- star room , but the rest of the resort more than makes up for it i could not , for the life of me , think of what would cause people to have a bad time here except for having a bad attitude the service is phenomenal , and we were always greeted with an hola when we arrived for meals , the hostess would take my arm and lead me to our seats , which i thought was a nice touch the language barrier was not a problem for us at all , especially when we tried to speak our terrible spanish we did not end up tipping because in the mad wedding rush , we did not get any ones from the bank , but we made a point to write a comment card listing the names of people who went above and beyond one thing that i was slightly unprepared for : you will be charged a $10 per person entrance tax to the dr when your flight lands just thought i would throw that out there we enjoyed excellence so much and certainly did not want to leave i would recommend it to anyone just be flexible and enjoy relaxing in the beautiful surroundings you 're on vacation 
do not hesitate to book it we have just returned on the 24th from a 14 night holiday at this resort and overall we loved the experience less positive points first : in relation to the journey from the airport to the resort - yes , it is bumpy and you might , like myself , feel a bit sick after an hour of what i would call 'a dominican driving experience ' just take the opportunity to check the views and the way people leave the check - in at the hotel - this was the only negative point i have to make about the hotel the person at the reception was rather unhelpful first told us to wait without giving any apparent reason for it and , after a good 20' , came to us , gave us the cards to the room and did not give us any other information ( e how to get to our room or other basic information ) later we went back to the reception area and we 've spoken to a very nice concierge who apologized and provided all the information we were after now the positives : room - lovely room , with a lot of space and near the cascade pool , in very quiet location all the drinks in the fridge were nice and cold and the air conditioning always worked well very clean and great turn down service ( some great surprises ) thank you to the ladies that cleaned our room - 4211swimming pools - beautiful surroundings , endless pools and very clean beach - as i am not a swimming pool person , this for me was one of my main concerns , as some of the reviews were rather worrying i wanted this holiday to be very special as it was our wedding anniversary and a long waited holiday too because of the comments about the water it took me a while to decide to book this resort i was so relieved to see an amazing , almost immaculate white sandy beach yes , there were always red flags ( this means you can enter the water up to waist level ) and some areas with black flags , but i believe this was merely to avoid any adventurous people to go too far from the coast and put themselves at risk i do not consider the sea was rough moreover , you can walk more then 100 meters into the water with the water below your waist we have spent the majority of our afternoons enjoying the warm waters or snorkeling we saw quite a lot of fishes although not a wide variety but you can always book a trip to enjoy good snorkeling in other parts of the island the scenario is really beautiful loved seeing 9 very well organized weddings happening at the beach without any disruption to the other guests ( just made the scenario even more idyllic ) we always had one of the bartenders coming around regularly a special thanks to juan , altagracia and all the people that worked at the beach under incredible hot sun and made sure we always had a drink in our hands they well deserve a tip food - you had 8 restaurants to choose from overall they were all quite good except for the oregano i ordered a vegetarian lasagna and honestly , this was the most hard lasagna i ever had in my life i have never seen anything like that and could not stop laughing at the situation loved the grill , specially the fillet mignon spice was also one of my favorites as well as barcelona but my husband preferred chez isabelle some of the food was a bit too salty to my particular taste and there were some foods i did not try again , but this was due to my personal choices but generally it was very good only one comment on the portion sizes and some holiday makers attitudes they are enormous and the majority of people did not eat even half of their meals this was particularly noticeable with our american colleagues who happily asked for several different foods and then only had a few bites in each leaving the rest in the plate i am sorry guys but i find this a bit difficult to understand this people earn an average of $350/month , leave in - halls and we are in a very poor country i found it almost insulting this lack of consideration ( i really needed to share this thought ) also on tuesdays they have the beach party with traditional dominican food take lots of repellent and go , you will enjoy it entertainment - day entertainment - we never got involved , but there were plenty of activities for you to joinnight entertainment - although not traditional , there was some really nice shows my favorites : michael jackson and the circus the spa - please experience the serenity couples massage , well worth the money finally , as we went on the saona trip we had the opportunity to see other resorts as they had to collect some people on the way you will regret if you do not go to excellence 
do not be fooled by the website excellence is average at best i have read many positive reviews about excellence pc , but i believe it was average at best , especially if you are into luxury travel the ride to/from the airport is definitely rough due to potholes , but not a problem as long as you do not get carsick easily or have a bad back i highly recommend taking a taxi ( $60) to get there much quicker definitely bring insect repellent if biting bugs find you even remotely appetizing and use it religiously those buggers are everywhere , even in the beds the service was just average yes , the staff is very friendly when you interact with them , but we had lots of trouble getting anyone up to the room to address problems that we had ( no a/c , clogged toilet , bugs in the bathroom , etc the staff is definitely on island time if they tell you they 'll be there in 20 minutes , it will be more like 45 or perhaps not at all the rooms are okay , but not nearly as nice as they appear on the web site lots of those little bugs all were around my bathroom no matter how much the staff cleaned it may be worth it for you to upgrade to the excellence club package it was kind of nice to have a dedicated concierge and private pool and beach ( assuming other guests respect the signs , since the staff is not there to check ) generally , we found the nightly entertainment to be lame the shows were mostly corny lipsynching of american pop songs the beaches were beautiful - - groomed daily and it was fun and generally safe to go waist deep and enjoy the waves if you like to scuba , be prepared for a 1 5 hour trip the the west side of the island which has much calmer waters coming from someone who has been to several all - inclusives , the food here was just average really , there was just nothing special about it agave was the best place we went to the drinks were fantastic at all of the bars there is very little opportunity to go outside the resort to learn about dominican culture we did the bike tour and found it very boring ( passed nothing but more resorts we really enjoyed the tennis lessons , ping pong , and spa treatments lastly , my husband got very sick and was up all night with vomit and diarreah and spent 1 5 days in the punta cana central hospital it turned out to be a parasite which we believe he got from the portobello mushrooms at chez isabelle we when got back to the hotel , we realized that he got a hernia from vomiting so much and will likely need surgery in the u i do not think this is neccessarily a problem with the hotel , but just a general risk that you run when going to any country with lower health standards however , it may comfort you to know that the medical staff at the hotel and the hospital were professional and attentive , and they took our u bottom line , if you are into high end travel , with top notch cuisine and really attentive service , this is not the place for you but if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive all inclusive and are not considered delicious by biting insects , then it 's worth a shot 
wonderful time wonderful time beauty and elagance in one wonderful enviorment we stayed for the week of june 8th -15th for our anniversary i had ordered flowers for my wife which were beautiful and the hotel had put a fruit tray and a bottle of champagne in the room , which only added to the ambiance the stay was good , food was plentiful being used to ny portions there was still plenty of food the only drawback was no casual night time dining men make sure you have long pants for dinner you can wear shorts at the grill but no where else mosquitos are plentiful at night and early in the morning , be prepared as bug spary will cost upwards of $10 the casino is very small 12-15 slots black jack and a roulette wheel bring us dollars they do not give face value for travellers checks they were taking 28% off the face value at the time we were there never had this problem any where else we stayed in the islands dont miss the eco walk by the main gate lots of birds fish flamingos and our favorites the macaw parrots the lagoon pool is shallow 3-4' but the cascade pool is beautiful located by the mexican resturant its 5-6' deep very quiet on that side over all we really enjoyed our stay and the people there will go out of there way to make you happy 
loved the excellence punta cana we spent 5 days at the excellence in punta cana for our honeymoon and loved it the resort is beautiful and very well maintained everyone on the staff is always friendly and helpful the most memorable part is the food in all of the restaurants each dinner was more remarkable than the one before even though the resort was busy , there was never a wait for a meal we made a reservation for dinner at chez isabelle and it was great the drive from the airport is long , but once we got to the resort we were very , very pleased we had no problem locating our shuttle from the airport to the hotel and they scheduled our ride back to the airport once our stay was over everyone seemed very organized and everything ran smoothly a great place to stay for your honeymoon we are already looking forward to going back in 5 years 
without doubt highly recommended we have just returned from a fantastic holiday at this hotel in punta cana as with most people there are positives as well as negatives , but i will not start this review with the negatives and the positives certainly outweigh them the arrival at punta cana was a welcome sight after a 9 5 hour flight from the uk the airport is very different than most as the customs area and baggage collection points are open around the sides with thatched roofs , allowing the breeze to run through collection of baggage was swift and we were then transferred to the hotel by vip travel , with only the two of us in the minibus as has been reported before the roads do have lots of potholes , but from previous reports i was expecting worse whatever your view is on the state of the roads it is certainly worth the 1 hr journey once you arrive at the hotel check - in was very quick and we were then shown to our room , which was large , clean and well equipped with all you could want the grounds and buildings are spectacular and a lot of attention to detail has been put into the structure of this hotel , with restaurants overlooking swimming pools , fish ponds or courtyards there are many restaurants to choose from there is the option of buffet breakfast and lunch , or served breakfast at the lobster house , or served lunch at the grill there was one buffet dinner in the italian one night during our stay which was very welcome as we would have liked this option on other evenings , not always wanting a - la - carte some have reported negatively about having to wait for restaurants if you eat between 6 30 there is not always the need to wait if you do not want to eat that early , we found the best way was to wait until they were giving out the pagers and then ask for a table the wait then was about 30-45 minutes we tried all but the lobster and mexican restaurants and our favourites were spice ( asian ) and chez isabelle ( french ) we visited these two on 2/3 occasions the staff are all very friendly and willing to assist maybe tipping does go some way to improved service , but i do not believe it is absolutely necessary , i think that is down to personal opinion we did tip but not every time we were served a drink for example domingo the sax player is fantastic , we never tired of his music the shows that we saw were good , although we did not see every one they do tend to run on a seven day cycle , not 14 as most of the american and canadian guests are only there for one week it is nice to sit in the open air at the plaza area and have a drink , the breeze is always very welcome there is also the martini bar which is near the lobby if you want to get away from the music or show any evening , there is also the option of having a drink at the bar between the french and mexican restaurants , you can also sit in the courtyard here the wildlife around the front of the hotel is nice to see there are different varieties of ducks , flamingos and parrots , all roaming freely you can also feed them bread which is provided and they are actually quite gentle when they take it from you the beach is fantastic is you like to walk beaches as has been reported many times the under - current in the water means most parts are unsuitable for swimming , or anything other than walking along the shoreline on most days you were allowed to go in the water at one end of the resort , although not every day as the water became more rough there was a lifeguard on duty and we did see him go in to rescue one couple who were in trouble with the current everyone was then told to get out of the water around the corners at each end of the beach it is very different , there are reefs which break up the waves and these areas are calm and perfectly ok to swim in as said previously for those who enjoy a good walk on the beach this is certainly one of the better islands to be able to do this now for the negatives , the first of which cannot be blamed on the staff at the hotel the mosquitos are bad ? the first week worse than the second i believe there had been rain before we arrived which may be attributable to the problem we experienced there are vehicles/machines which spray chemicals at around 6 this leaves a horrendous cloud , with an awful smell which cannot be good for you and i believe also encourages the mosquitos to go in search of humans one night it was that bad that the waitresses were going around with repellent on the trays and offering to spray people the pharmacy also ran out of repellent temporarily we gave up counting after i received more than 200 bites i also believe that the hotel has marsh land to the side of it which does not help the problem the only other negative we had was that the maid kept leaving our balcony door unlocked we would go out and lock it and when we returned it was always unlocked we reported this to concierge and they promised to notify housekeeping when we returned the next night it was again unlocked and again the following night we reported it again to concierge and were again promised they would deal with the problem we then had to complain for a third time and again this did not work i did make an official complaint on the evening before we left i am not saying that this happens in every block with every maid i think we were just unlucky with ours having experienced break - ins in other countries i was wary about this , especially as we were the end block and there had been a hole cut through the fence which could have allowed trespassers maybe us being over - cautious but in jamaica a couple on our flight had their safe removed with all its contents and the police said there was no forced entry into their room , they also knew they have locked their balcony door well that is enough of the negative and i cannot speak highly enough about the staff in general , the buildings , the landscape and the big plus is that it was adults only it is also comforting to know that the staff will not tolerate unacceptable behaviour , which also upsets other guests a couple arrived one day under the influence ( badly ) they were very loud , rude to the staff and guests and totally out of order they were promptly taken by security and the police were called their belongings were packed by security and they were taken off the premises i would definitely recommend this hotel , but would personally not return because of the mosquitos ? maybe we were just unlucky 
excellence is excellenti well were shall i start restaurants : all restaurants were amazing , the only one we were unable to eat at is the french restaurant , and there was always a long wait we usually eat supper around 8pm the pizza restaurant for a late night snack was awesome but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for your pizza we usually went there after the show , which was around 12am many people would head there for a snack , which caused a little backlog but when you are on vacation the service in all restaurants was amazing every detail has been taken care of what we loved most is there are no reservations required at all restaurants it makes things more relaxed rooms : the rooms were spacious and nice , the hotels claims they have wifi in every room the signal is extremely poor we were originally in building 11 which is quite far from the lobby we requested a room change , something closer to the lobby they moved us to building 2 the wifi signal was still poor the best signal is in the lobby , so i would take my laptop to the bar in the morning , have a great cappuccino and connect to the net what a life ha - hathe only negative about our room 2208 was the air conditioning was not working well we complained a few times , they sent people to play with the thermostat the problem were never resolved and i did not feel like changing rooms again in the room was ok for sleeping pools : beautiful beaches : beautiful , the ocean is rough , but we knew that when we booked there entertainment : the evening shows were ok at least they try and succeed to entertain us bars : bars are all awesome , all drinks are freshly made bar staff are awesome check - ineverything was smooth , no problems the bus ride from the airport is 1 hour and 15 minutes 
loved it , loved it it was an absolute perfect honeymoon place we had a blast the whole place was beautiful , food was wonderful , staff was super nice 
sure , the ride form the airport is long and bumpy , but just ask your driver to stop on the way for some cold beers and he will be happy to oblige i would recommend the upgrade to the excellence package the stay was excellent food was good drinks were great the mamajuana was awesome i will be going back soon i was most impressed with the staff the nightly entertainment is wonderful we caught the michael jackson show , a solo performer and the circus show the only drawback , and this is minor , the ocean was a little rough , but i just got in to cool off anyway a must go for couples you 'll love it 
a very nice vacation experience my wife and i just returned from excellence punta cana after a 6 night stay in mid - may 2008 our goal was to relax , hang by the pool , a little romance , a couple of novels , and a week away from most of the normal stuff ( like children and work ) our expectations were met on every front and exceeded on most the very short version is that the weather was fabulous , the room accommodations were fine , the food ranged from very good to really outstanding , the staff was very hard working and helpful , and we would suggest that you seriously consider excellence for an upscale , yet affordable vacation experience now the details and the very long version my wife and i ( early 50s , both educators ) had been talking about a resort vacation for more than a year we have cruised the caribbean a couple of times and enjoyed those experiences , have gone to atlantis a couple of times ( splurge , anniversary i have read reviews that made excellence look like a great possibility , and a good deal as well my wife joined spirit air 's 9$ club , as spirit hubs out of ft lauderdale , thus is quite convenient we booked the air for what we considered a bargain basement price then i went to work on the land portion i priced the resort portion at 15 different places i ended up booking with an online travel service called skoosh their price was more than $400 below the average price from other providers i was concerned as i had no skoosh experience , but everything went just the way that it should have i was very happy with the price , and happy with everything else our flight from ft lauderdale to punta cana was non - stop and non - eventful we processed thru customs and just as the resort said , there was a driver holding a sign with our name on it we arranged transport via taxi through excellence via email and it worked out great the price was $60 and worth it the trip was not the harrowing , take a valium , oh my god trip that others have reported parts of the road are not good , there are some potholes the size of vws , and some speedbumps that are really short walls , but our trip was just a few minutes over 1 hour on the way to the resort and a few minutes short of an hour on the way back to the airport taking the taxi eliminated all of the stopping at other resorts and all of those issues , and i would recommend considering this option our arrival and initial processing at excellence was quick and easy we had asked for a king room , but found a double they offered to move us the next day , as no other king was available we ended up looking at the king room the next day but stayed because of location we found that almost all of the time we spent in the room was either in the jacuzzi bathtub ( bring your own bubble bath very good tip ) or sleeping , so the room was not really an issue it was spacious , kept clean and well stocked , but we did not spend much time there we were in building 9 and found it to be very convenient with respect to the pool , and the restaurants in addition , and very important to us since we are both teaching on - line classes was internet access we had consistent connections in the room ( not so much by the pool ) with good speed we could keep up with our classes and e - mail and deep up with the home front very easily we spoke to others that did not have the same internet success , so if internet is important to you , you might look toward building 9 or that vicinity most of our time was spent by the pool , and what a pool it is every morning , the entire pool deck was mopped , and the whole pool was brushed take a look at some of the pictures in other reviews , and you will realize just what that entails the pool deck is of terra cotta like tiles , and sandals or flip - flops are an absolute necessity as those tiles start getting hot by late morning and by mid afternoon make it a challenge to walk 15 feet without risking blisters there are some people that hoard space , grabbing 2 different sets of lounges ( sun and shade ) as well as a poolside bed these are also the people that apparently cannot dry off without 6 towels , and have to have a pool float by them regardless of whether they will use them or not it is true that to get ??rime? spots , it is necessary to get down early one group of 20 had a 6 am wake up call so one of the group could go down and get space together i was usually down by 7am ( i normally wake early ) and had no problem getting our same ??rime? spot each day hint : take your towel back to your room if you plan on claiming space early the beach towels didn?? always show up early , but they always did show up the rule seems to be that a folded or rolled towel indicates availability and a spread out towel means reserved bars are spread out along the length of the pools , and pool and beach waiters are plentiful most of the pool activities occur toward the north end of the pool a list of the day?? activities is available each morning at the concierge desk my wife enjoyed the aqua gym ( water aerobics ) , and water volley ball appeared quite popular as well lots of other pool - based games occurred throughout the day , but we were usually engaged with novels and did not partake there is an introduction to scuba in the pool that looked like fun , and if you have never experienced scuba , it might be a memorable experience most of our pool time was hanging out , floating , at the pool bar , or just finding a quiet , shady spot to read there were some topless women sunning on the pool deck , but hey , we??e all adults , right there was a bit more toplessness on the beach itself , and at least one couple went several hundred yards south on the beach and established that area as the nude beach all in all , i would say the percentage of topless was in the single digits most swim wear was quite sedate , as was most behavior another activity that we engaged in was the horseback riding we arranged our horse excursion the day we arrived and went out 2 days later at the 10 am flight it was at no cost , and was really outstanding it is supposed to be a half hour ride on the beach , but we were out for an hour and the guys were great if you go on this , bring some cash , as there are not only opportunities to thank them financially for their hard work , but they offer a cd of dominican music with a personalized cd cover with a small bottle of local rum also to get to the horses you pass the shopping area yes , the vendors can be a little pushy if you let them , and the rumor is that the price offered is not the price paid , so negotiating skills might be called into play we attended spanish lessons most days inez was our favorite teacher our spanish skills improved significantly as the week went on i went to the gym most days it is up near the front gate behind the disco , and is new and clean and has excellent equipment for aerobic conditioning ( ellipticals , treadmills , and some slider - type of stairmaster ) as well as all the weight machines and free weights at around 12:30 each day , on the beach , they cook lunch it is outstanding we had beef fajitas , dominican rice , and a seafood and pasta dish that were all big - time good hit the kafe caf? for a drink , and the ice cream machine at kafe caf? for dessert and you have a fresh , local lunch treat there was also a hot dog cart at one of the pool bars , and pizza was available for delivery to your lounge chair , so if you didn?? want to get dry and go to one of restaurants , lunch was not an issue , with several choices available on to the restaurants 
i visited the excellence punta cana resort may 4- may 10, and loved every minute of my trip everything was so organized from the minute we stepped foot into the punta cana airport there was the transport to the hotel , which was easy to locate and very comfortable when we arrived at our resort , it looked amazing and even more amazing was we were presented with wet towels and champagne after getting off of the bus the check in was easy and quick the beach was absolute paradise , with lounge chairs and waiters at your finger tips the beach even had hammocks and beds on it it was truly unbelievable the pool was the same , just perfect there were more then enough lounge chairs and beds , and the pool was large enough that you can have a whole private area just to yourself the entertainment staff was the best they kept you going if you chose from morning until night thank you so much franklin , joel , and julio you guys were the best the staff had many different activities for all people and all interests , but was not pushy in making you do anything thats what i loved best however , they made everything a lot of fun we miss you franklin thank you for not being too busy to talk with us and teach us about your culture , as well as learn about ours we are definitely coming back to see you three and we also told our parents about the entertainment staff and encouraged them to go hope to see you soon the rooms were beautiful a large jacuzzi in the center our room had the swim out pool , which was a nice added feature to get because that pool is very private with no more than ten guests at one time we loved it the rooms and the property was always kept clean : spotless another added benefit to this resort is that it had more than one boutique it actually had several stores connected to the resort so that you did not have to go into town it was really nice not having to leave your resort this resort is definitely much better than i had imagined and is rated a 10 i was surprisingly shocked , because it is an all inclusive and many people assume the food would not be good and the service would not be as great this resort proves that bias untrue i do not visit many places twice , but would definitely go back to this resort several times in the future 
truly excellent wow , what a great resort just for the record , i hate all inclusives the only reason my wife and i went is because we were both burned out and needed to get away for a holiday where no thinking was required i wanted everything done for me with no b i got it at the excellence a very well run resort food was very good ( not excellent , but very good ) but the drinks were first rate avoid the lobster house and the buffett ( the buffett was truly awful ) and you should have no problems with the food bar service was wonderful my new friend benjamin makes a great i do not know entertainment was very good the tennis pro rolando was exceptional , a charming individual , a real pro and a very patient man the gym is fantastic , such equipment the rooms are large and comfortable the bed was a huge four poster canopy affair , i loved it and now i want one of my own everything worked in the room and the room itself was clean the grounds of the resort were likewise well groomed and well maintained with the buildings and furnishings being very tasteful it truly does look like a what a five star resort should look like a very beautiful place the beach is wonderful and secluded but the water right in front of the hotel is a bit rough take a short walk to either side of the hotel for a nice calm coral pool if you want a relaxing swim overall a good relaxing vacation with no issues whatsoever the staff was attentive without being intrusive and provided just what i needed , a luxurious and trouble free vacation where i could just not give a thought to anything all and simply have my needs looked after yes , i would like to go back or perhaps even try out the other excellence resorts 
fun in the sun at excellence i stayed at the excellence resort with my boyfriend from may 5th -15th we have stayed at various all inclusive resorts in turks and caicos , mexico , and the dr over the years i have yet to stay at what i would consider to be a five star resort , and would rate excellence as a four star before i start going off about what i did not like about my stay , let me make this clear : i truly believe that vacation is like life , it 's what you make of it i had an awesome vacation , and fail to see how anyone could have any serious regrets about staying at this resort so many reviews complained about the ride from the hotel i say relax and take in the view the closer you get to the resort , the more fields with beautiful views enjoy the bumpy roads , they are no worse than some of the frost heaves roads we get in nh the service ca not be beat all my complaints and requests were handled with a smile , and professionalism sometimes it took longer than i would have liked to get things fixed ( screen door ) , but again i tried to remember that i was not in the usa , and things move at a different pace go with the flow the wait staff , hostesses , front desk , maintenance , bar keep , chefs and so on were attentive and friendly if you have a chance to meet the su chef waldy at lunch , tell him patty and scott from nh say hello he really wants peoples opinions of the food , which is not an open attitude you would normally see from a chef here 's my review on the much debated issue of food : ( fyi - i ordered more than one meal frequently at one sitting so i could try everything ) in general lunch and breakfast were my favorite meals of the day i like a little of everything so these were the meals for me since they were buffets mexican food is my favorite , so i was in heaven with the non traditional breakfast although they had all the american fair as well pancakes , really good bacon , and so on the pastries were outstanding dinner was either hit or miss , but i think it 's like that with most places you stay not every meal is going to be incredible the best meals i had came from spice ( everything is delicious ) , the mexican restaurant ( try the roast chicken ) , and the mediterranean ( loved the shrimp ) the italian and the french restaurant were disappointing only because my meals were missing key ingredients , such as leeks , mushrooms , and truffles oil i have found this to be the norm at all the resorts i have stayed at the absolute worse meal we had was at the grill i could not imagine that this would have been so bad , but it was it was really bad i 'm not sure if it is the quality of meat , but both of our meals were so though that we could not finish them i was unable to cut through my ribs at all thankfully , room service saved the night we did not eat at pizza place , only because we had pizza at lunch all the time , so we did not see the point in having it for dinner also i 'm not sure who the pastry chef is at the resort , but my hat goes off to him - her i loved all the desserts i had the three milk cake everyday ( along with others ) room service rocked , and had it many times at various times of day i especially enjoyed the chicken taco for a late night snack , as well as the apple pie sometimes i had to wait over an hour for the food to come , but it was never a big deal even though it is an all inclusive resort , we tipped everyday especially the maids , as they make such little money we brought red sox hats to give out , and it went over very well we got a big hug from a young kid who was nearly in tears that was the best part of my vacation we forgot to bring colored pencils and sharpeners for the staff who has kids at home , ( and there are many we have friends who build schools in the dr , and they suggest that colored pencils and sharpeners are rare to come by , and would make a nice gift and of course , anything red sox would be a big hit we stayed in a jr suite with a partial ocean view the view was partial because of a palm tree , but i liked it because it gave us more privacy my only real complaint about the room was that it was seriously musty when the ac was on , and the ac did not work very well anyway this did effect my overall stay to some degree , and that was regrettable since i spent so much more money to have the ocean view i liked the big tub in the room , although i did not use it very much because it was so hot out who takes a bath in the summer the overall set up of the room was nice , the bed was hard but comfortable , the bar was well stocked and so on there was some general wear in the room , but i overlooked it to the best of my ability the real reason i went to this resort was for the beach for me , it was one of the best beaches that i have been to in the dr i had a blast playing in the waves , my boy friend had fun riding the waves on a boogie board a short walk to the right on the beach will bring you to calm waters for a swim if you are afraid to swim with the waves i never went out in the water beyond my waist , and never felt as though i was in any danger if you swim with some common sense , you will have no problem playing in the water you have to get up early to grab a beach bed , but it is worth it we only did it once , because it was so hot when we here there , and sought out the shade of the palm trees in 10 days i only had five minutes of rain everyday was full on sun , and near 90 degrees the weather was way better than i thought it would be as i have never gone in may before it was actually nice to come home to n and not have it be snowing here is the one reason i will not be returning to this resort : the massive spraying of pesticides was the worse i have seen at any of the resorts that i have stayed at i am use to some person going around at night with a back pack of pesticides spraying everything however , this resort also had a huge truck that drove around every night engulfing the resort in a chemical fog , followed by the back pack man most of the time i could taste the chemicals in my mouth , yuck beware people who choose to eat at the grill when this spraying is being done the tough meet pales in comparison it defies reason that there would be any bugs , but i believe that they must have evolved to resist the spray bring bug spray or suffer at night 
out of this world? 5* excellence for 14 nights the excellence hotel appeals to absolutely everyone , i have never been to a place that can be so full of life yet so tranquil on arrival we were greeted with cold towels and a glass of chilled champagne??he perfect start to what was pure 5 * excellence for 14 nights the room was amazing and the 4 poster bed and large jacuzzi bath is standard we had turn down service 12 of the 14 nights and on occasions they filled the jacuzzi and left floating rose petals they also leave you a daily newsletter which is a great way of keeping in touch with what is going on breakfast was incredible , you are greeted by a display of champagne on ice for bucks fizz or smirnoff vodka and tomato juice for a bloody mary we enjoyed smoked salmon bagels with caviar , freshly prepared pancakes and omelettes and the smoothy bar is also incredible the pool was thoroughly cleaned everyday and the pool bar service was amazing the hotel provides some fabulous blue floating mats ( like lilos ) for communal use and asked guests to ??im for guest harmony? leaving the mats in the pool? some guests ignored this during our stay and selfishly kept the mats under their sun beds even when they weren?? using them? once some people did it others followed and therefore not all guests got to enjoy them which was a real shame the red flag flies everyday at the beach and they have small black flags in the sand as the sea is incredibly choppy and the waves are strong so do take care if you do venture into the sea outside the designated area the security staff will blow a whistle and ask you to come out you are on the beach at your own risk but its best to swim only in the designated area if you are a strong swimmer pre - dinner drinks at the martini bar are fantastic as they have the most amazing saxophone player all drinks are named brands and they have there are 8 a la carte restaurants in the evening which made us feel like we were dining at a difference place every night we tried every restaurant and the french came out on top ? it was the best foie gras and chateaubriand steak i have ever tasted one thing i will say is take some strong mosquito spray we took some with us but the mosquito?? were not put off by it so we ended up buying some from the pharmacy and its not cheap the shops in general are very overpriced so take all the toiletries you think you will need this truly is an excellent hotel and well worth the money as we had absolutely no complaints at all 
everything we were wanting in a vacation my husband and i do not travel very often without our children so we really wanted to stay in a place that would meet all our needs i have to say we were blown away from the minute we arrived it felt like we were in paradise we have stayed in many all inclusive places including sandals , and by far this was the best it is the most relaxing atmosphere , so romantic , staff is so friendly and the food delicious if your looking for loud and party people , there is an area they seem to gather if your looking for peace and quiet , there is an area for you or , if you would like a little activity but still stay low key , there is an area for that too the place is so big , you can get lost , or be involved the pools are immaculate and enormous the beach is gorgeous the waiter service by the pool and beach is excellent for the late night hunger the boxed pizza really hits the spot do not let the ride to the resort stop you from choosing this place if you book your transport to the resort before you leave , ( from a reputable company ) the ride really is not bad at all i found it very interesting my husband and i do not want to stay anywhere else now that we have experienced the excellence hotel 
romantic hotel we loved this hotel so much we did not want to leave everything was so well laid out , the shows were fantastic , the guy playing the sax was amazing , what a romantic place to spend a week the food was good and you can always find something you like the rooms are great but the only problem was the musty smell in the room and in our clothes which is extremely hard to get out when you get home it was nice to have a casino at the hotel but do not get excited cause you wo not win but it was fun anyway we will try the excellence in riviera maya sometime soon , hope it is as good as this one 
excellence is excellente this was our 8th visit the resort continues to improve facilities and service one of the few adutl - only resorts in punta cana extremely friendly staff recommend booking an excellence club accommodation , since it provides special room amenities and access to the excellence club lounge with complimentarty food , beverages and pc 's food is average but there are many choices of restaurants beach is exquisite - palm trees , palapas and a long beach for walking recommend having resort arrange for private transportation to and from the airport it is an hour ride from airport , and is worth the convenience at $120 round trip avoid the tour operator bus twhich meanders from resort to resort dropping off guests 
loved the excellence resort we loved our 2 week stay , we did upgrade upon arrival to club it was a few dollars more , but we loved the extras and that side of the resort , it was worth it the property is absolutely beautiful the food was excellent the staff was exceptional , they called our room a number of times to ask if we needed anything and if we were enjoying our stay our room always had fresh fruit and fully stocked mini bar , cleaning service two times a day plus nightly turn down the room had bath robes , slippers and a beach bag for use during our stay as club members we had use of the lounge which had a huge flat screen tv , movies and books to bring back to your room , food and drinks , coffee , desserts , internet access and conceirge personel we enjoyed massages , facials and the wellness pools at the spa there is a gym we enjoyed too the shops were convenient with great things to purchase they keep the resort exceptionally clean the waiter service poolside and at the beach was great there are great pool  beach side double beds if you want to take a break from the traditional lounge chairs they have we are from long island , ny in our early 40's and loved this resort it is secluded and a wonderful place to relax and be pampered 
not the greatest my sister and i just returned from 1 week at the excellence we purchased the excellence club which gives you private check in , and a few perks we booked through an agent , who requested double beds and on the 1st floor as my sister has a very bad foot problem , on arrival we were taken to our room with a king size bed - we told them it was not suitable and they said they did not have anything available , i was quick to comment that they then should not have taken our reservation eventually 5 hours later and $600 00 more dollars we had a room with 2 beds on the 2nd floor needless to say our first day was horrible next day got up and went for some breakfast , got out to the pool and no chairs - most of them were not being used but had towels on them and were being saved down to the beach , water was rough , we never got in the ocean the next day and every day after i got up at 6 and went down to save our chairs the weather was not great , rain and cloudy every afternoon the power and water went out for at least 1 hour if not more a day the wait for the restaurants was generally 1 hour to 1-1/2 hours , they need a dinner buffet we never got into the french restaurant the wait was 2 hours , we could not evern get a beeper overall the food was not great - we lived on watermelon and cheese from the buffet and the excellence club i will definately never go back , i 've not travelled much but this is my 4th all inclusive , all have been 4-5 star and this by far was the worst , i would not recommend this hotel 
why is this rated number 1 just returned was scheduled for a week , but cut it short due to the following : the beach had black flags every single day due to dangerous conditions this is the highest danger rating that exists for this resort , at least this apparently is their normal beach condition having stayed at the majestic a few months earlier , that beach was not only amazing , but you could spend the entire day in the water without feeling threatened the food was mediocre at best , with the exception of their french restaurant once again , the majestic had far better food the upgrade to the excellence club , which we had done , was rather pointless fyi , the vip transport bus returning us to the airport was a disaster because they were 'nt filled to capacity , they waited for passengers , and then even made an additional stop , despite the fact that they cost us an hour of check - in time have already rebooked the majestic , and look forward to it immensely once again , the people of the dominican republic are absolutely wonderful and do everything to please 
worst place ever as the gran bahia hotel was overbooked , they suggested to pay us to go on a three - day trip to the excellence h?tel , supposingly to be the best hotel in punta cana how disappointed we were all start with the rooms : toilets that did not flush , yellow water in the bath , hair left on the comb ( disgusting ) , problems with tv ( not working ) , etc the worst is dinner  breakfast no reservations are required very good , but they did not tell us that you have to wait between 20-30 minutes to breakfast , and about 2 hours for dinner imagine your stress everyday three days were an agony for us food was not too bad , but compare to the gran bahia , you have no choice of food , no originality at the gran bahia , there is a theme everyday adding to the traditional egg - bacon breakfast after three days of the same food , you 're happy to have a change you are on vacation , right you deserve the best you pay for it on top of all your problem : the staff some speak english ( or about ) no smile , no laugh cold , freezing atmosphere 
this was our first visit to punta cana and we will not be returning we had heard about the great service and wonderful resort and found none of it to be true the rooms were dirty , the food , with one exception , was below par and the service was , again with a few exceptions , horrible i??e seen nicer beaches at the jersey shore if you plan to take any tours expect to spend lots of money there were very few activities included the staff was ok unless there was a problem then they were indifferent or just did not understand english the dining rooms had dead flies on the window sills the a/c was so ineffective we had to demand a new room it took three calls and a very long wait (2 hours ) to get any service to the first room vis - a - vis the a/c when we went to the front - desk to complain , the clerks at the desk would pass the problem people off to each other and then refuse to talk to you they called a manager who was not a manager and would not/could not help us we availed ourselves of room - service twice the first time it took 45 minutes for a bottle of champagne to appear and it was warm the second time they told us we would have to go to the bar if we wanted any drinks sent to the room the spa service was excellent , and reasonable - - comparable in cost and quality to a state - side spa the french restaurant ( chez isabella ) was very good the wait was typically over an hour , but worth it a few members of the staff did excel , these folks are what we expected , but they were few and far between we would recommend you stay very far away 
great stay , great honeymoon just returned from our honeymoon and it was glorious having meticulous read reviews here weekly the last six months i??l touch on some of the popular topics : the infamous drive : maybe it?? because this was our first trip to the caribbean but we loved the hour drive we knew we?? be vegging on the resort the entire time so we wanted to see as much countryside and dominican ??owns? it could have been longer and we wouldn?? have minded once we got there , aka the grounds/service/beach/etc : the resort was absolutely gorgeous as i??e read , when you ( if you ) drive to other resorts to drop off/pick up others on your shuttle ride you will see that in comparison to the others this is one of the best the service throughout the resort is some of the best i??e encountered it is evident on the drive to the resort why the workers on the resort work so hard to please and appreciate tips so much ( $100 in ones was perfect for a week ) everyone acts cheery , attentive and kind the beach was also great the best part being the constant breeze that keeps you cool when lounging , and the resulting waves from the wind that provide both a perfect soundtrack and something fun to play in we live in the tampa/clearwater area which ??llegedly? is supposed to have three of the top ten beaches in the world ( according to dr beach ) and would take this beach over anything around here any day night time entertainment : we loved it is it cheesy abso - freakin - lutely that?? what made it so entertaining to us don?? get me wrong , they are indeed quality performers??ut when you have an entire show dedicated to michael jackson , i mean , really now we hit almost every show and loved every one what is not cheesy however , or who isn?? i should say , is the nightly sax guy some real quality there no matter where in the world he would be playing check him out in the martini bar before every show we also loved making absolute fools of ourselves in the disco almost every night my apologizes to anyone who had to watch us ??ance???? day full of boat drinks and presidentes will lead to some interesting moves : o ) but we had a blast every night we went speaking of boat drinks? br/>drinks : free flowing and tasty i mainly stuck to the presidente , but we hit a lot of the other stuff as well the sammy sosa was our favorite ( it?? just the strawberry daq mix with the pina colada mix topped with blue cauroco ) all the top shelf liquor you can handle , and just request your drink strong if you want to taste your liquor and they are happy to oblige we pretty much stayed tipsy from morning to night the entire time??is a beautiful thing entertainment team : ??ake - y wake - y? applause please , applause we thought we?? be avoiding them like the plague , us not being into silly group activities or the like but their enthusiasm was so infectious that we couldn?? help but join in and have a great time they really do but a smile on your face so go ahead and play one or two of their games or events great , great people food : saving the best for last oh how i wish that were the case the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars is that most of the food was mediocre at best for our ( not too discriminating ) tastes but that said , others both on this site and that we met there very much enjoyed it so i won?? go into too much detail bashing the food i??l just leave it as we personally didn?? care for it but even at that , i can honestly say it didn?? blemish our trip one bit ( maybe one tiny bit ) as everything else was great enough to overlook our thoughts on the food i will say that the honeymoon breakfast in bed and the french resteraunt were the highlights i don?? see how one could have a bad time at this resort we did encounter a few people who were moaning and groaning , but they seemed to be folks who would be miserable most anywhere o ) my only reservation would be if you are not a drinker and are going simply for the fine dining this is probably not the place for you a few tips : bring your sodas to the outside stores , they are as good as currency they have $40/70 minute massages at the first store on the left ( a female?? name that escapes me ) ??f you have a bit adventure sense it sure beats the resort prices do the horseback ride even though the horses look rather sad have fun , it?? hard not too and stephen/kim or will/lindsay??f you read this , big love to you cats good luck in love and life 
4 stars i rate excellence - punta cana as 4 stars for the most part it was great , but there were a few things that prevent me from giving a 5 star rating the good :1 grounds - the grounds are beautiful everything is well taken care of and very clean we took a walk one afternoon and stumbled upon the really cool nature trail they have a good collection of birds and it 's well worth it to take the walk room - since it was our honeymoon , we splurged for a honeymoon suite in the excellence club the suite was outstanding we had a separate living space and bedroom space we also had a large shower room with 6 water jets - i spent about 30 minutes in the shower the first day we also had 2 jacuzzis , 1 in the room and 1 on the balcony if you want to use the jacuzzi , make sure you start running the water well in advance it takes about 45 minutes to fill the tub food - out of about 20 meals i had , i would say about 17 of them were pretty good i had 2-3 fair meals , but out of 20 that 's pretty good the room service food is nothing special and we had to wait 1 5 hours for dinner when we ordered it 's definitely worth it to go to the restaurants chez isabelle has the best service the best meal i had was the ribeye at barcelona the breakfast/lunch buffets at toscana are pretty good , but if you want a really nice breakfast go to the lobster house and for a nice lunch go to the grill beach - i thought the beach was great we never had a problem getting chairs and an umbrella to swim we had to walk down to the right sie of the beach where the red flags are the flags were black on the left side of the beach , which means no swimming the bad :1 pool - the pool looked nice , but i did not get to spend much time there because it was so hard to get good seats since we are both fair skinned , if we are going to sit outside all day we need shade the problem is that people go out early in the morning and reserve pool chairs for the whole day one morning i went out at 7:45am and all the shady pool chairs were already reserved i 'm not sure how early you had to go out to reserve pool chairs , but it was earlier than i was willing to wake up waiting for restaurants - if you like to eat dinner later , expect to wait if you go eat between 6 - 6:30, you will not have to wait if you go between 6:30 - 8:00, you will wait about 30 minutes if you want to eat after 8:00, expect to wait about an hour or more they will give you a little beeper , so you can go anywhere to kill time , but you should check back in the hostess every 30 minutes or so a few times when we went back the hostess magically had a table ready for us even though our beeper never beeped if you want to eat at chez isabelle , you have to get there by 7:30 the 1st time we tried to go there , we got there at 8 and the hostess told us it was full for the night the 2nd time we got there at 6:30 and had to wait until 7:45 to get seated i asked the hostess about it and she said they fill up every night by 7:30 if you get there at 7:30, expect to wait until 9 to eat in general , epc is a great place , but a bit overcrowded if you are an early bird type , you wo not notice but if you are like me and you like to sleep in and eat dinner late , you will notice how crowded it is two piece of advice for honeymooners :1 the $600 honeymoon package is a rip off bottle of champage in your room on arrival - this is pretty worthless since they hand everyone a glass of champagne when you check in flowers/fruit in your room on arrive - the flowers were a tiny bouquet and the fruit was 3 apples breakfast in bed - it 's just a room service meal and it 's not really in bed they place it on the table in your room , d 50 minute spa package - this was very nice and cost $200 at the spa beachfront dinner - this was also very nice , but anyone can do this for $150 all in all , you can replicate the $600 package by paying $350 and calling room service one morning think twice before paying extra for the excellence club when i priced the room , it was about $600 more for the ec i thought that was a good deal because the honeymoon package ( which is free if you are in the ec ) cost $600 but i never really figured out what perks the ec provied the private beach is nice because there were always plenty of chairs/umbrellas but nobody checks who is going to the ec beach , so there was no need to pay for the ec to use the private beach the ec club was nothing special it 's basically a building with the same food/drinks as the rest of the resort if i was going on a honeymoon again , i would not pay for the excellence club or the $600 honeymoon package 
wonderful vacation we just returned from excellence last night this is a wonderful place to take a vacation we were there for 5 nights and stayed in the excellence club the rooms were nice the food was good the staff were always excellente and the drinks were cold the pool was an amazing place to meet people we camped out at the water in the same spot and became friends with many nice folks some of them we met here on trip advisor first we both said the first day that we would return to the resort the pace that you set is your own you can be very lazy or stay active it is totally your choice if you are on the fence about this resort just do it as you will not be sorry 
if you 're looking for peace and quiet and fabulous service , go go go we had 4 wonderful days there the no kids factor was huge love my kids to death but my husband and i needed to get away and being around children that are not your own is simply a ) annoying or b ) guilt ridden this was my first time at a place that was kidfree and i highly recommend it we upgraded to the excellence club for about $100 a day it was well worth it the use of the club was nice just to grab a quick bite after being at the pool or beach ( in lieu of going to one of the restaurants ) i had the impression that we may have had better housekeeping service as well and priority when it came to things like spa appointments and room service the evening entertainment was a bit lacking the michael jackson show was the best but some of the other evenings entertainment was a bit weak if the facility is looking for a way to improve , i would suggest they kick things up a notch in that area 
the excellence punta cana is wonderful excellent staff ( including julio , carlos , pablo , franklin , innis , and joel ) to dance , to practice spanish , to play , to exercise , to party , to listen and to smile and to make you smile ) ate at all the restaurants if you have an uneasy stomach then make sure you bring a big bottle of pepto bismol i lived on it and made it through even lost weight on this trip weather was very nice sunny , warm , windy and then rain and clouds the last day great waves at the sandy beach some days were not safe but amazing to sit and stop and stare staff always cleaning we had a problem with our room key cards a few times but was taken care of mini bar was fine lots of huts , and chairs , hammocks and beds to take advantage of for relaxing by the pool or the ocean we had a wonderful welcoming committe by another couple who had arrived just hours earlier everyone was friendly and always said hello activities were good staff were good at encouraging and making our stay enjoyable i braved the stage at karoke night and became known as sylvia by my friend julio we had opted to have extended checkout 4 hours later and cost $40 no big deal nice to have the option casino was ok loved the disco there are a few shops available on the property which was handy also , beautiful workout gym , brand new equipment and nice view , music and tv available while you excercise an hour drive from the airport on bumpy roads large grounds to walk around and explore the beach area met some very interesting people from around the world i would love to back some day soon i did not want to leave the airport i was the last one on the plane see you again excellence punta cana 
paradise found my girlfriend and i booked a week at the excellence to coincide with my mum 's wedding which she had arranged to have at the resort a soon as we were let into our room we knew we were somewhere very special , from the elegant 4 poster bed to the giant 2 person jaccuzi spa in the room we were on an all - inclusive trip and were delighted to find that the resort had a choice of 8 restraunts all with varying cuisines from french to mexican to pan - asian , and were more delighted to find that the quality of the food was even more impressive than the choice the breakfast buffet was the stuff of dreams : smoked salmon , caviar and creme cheese bagels washed down with champane was one of my firm favourites ( and remember this was all - inclusive with 7 or so bars and a huge selection of national and international alcohol , as well as a huge variety of cocktails , the drinks continued where the food left off facilities were also top rate , with one of the best - equipped gyms i have ever seen , multiple tennis courts , a spa ( which is not included ) and special mention has to go to lucas and julio cesa at the sports bar , we certainly enjoyed playing pool , ping pong and fuzball whilst being well watered by our favourite the resort had a great entertainment team that organised daily activities from water polo in one of the 3 swimming pools or beach volley ball on the resorts half mile private ( and utterly spectacular ) beach there was also a gigantic stage/theatre area with high quality nightly entertainment and a casino ( where we managed to double our spending money ) back to the beach the water was rough , and on a number of days there was no swimming due to an atlantic storm , however , the gorgeous sands , swaying palms , along with the resorts variety of hammocks , sun loungers , double beds and even 4 poster beds with curtains , easily made up for this we had a number of lovely walks along the beach , as well as a horse ride , my mum 's wedding ceremony and a private dinner where i proposed to my girlfriend under the stars , so i have verybfond memores of the place the staff are fantastic and friendly , and the attention to detail , such as making your towels into animals and putting rose petals aound the sink , is first class they clean your room twice a day , making your bed in the morning and turning it down in the evening , and really make you feel like a king this is certainly top of my list of places to go back to , and i strongly recomend it to anyone else looking for a highly pampered and relaxing holiday in the sunny carribean 
do not listen to negative reviews my fiancee and i , age 27  28, got back from excellence just over a week ago , and i have to say that this resort is amazing anyone who finds fault with it is either weird or someone who goes on vacation looking for something to complain about here 's a quick breakdown : beach : very nice and big not the white sand , but beautiful nontheless the water is pretty rough , and i was worried about that from reading other reviews , but i have to say that swimming in the ocean was more fun with the waves than in the calmer waters in mexico the red flag was flying everyday , but there were always people swimming and always a lifeguard on duty pools : amazing long and winding , with a nice swim - up bar and other bars always close by the more secluded cascade pool was really nice too like the beach , it was always pretty easy to find a place to lie down food : the last couple of reviewers said the food was horrible these people must be used to 5 star restaurants in paris , and even then i do not see how they could say that the food was bad we ate breakfast and lunch almost everyday at the toscana , although they always had something to eat by the pools and down at the beach at 12:30 the breakfast buffet was great my fiancee liked the omelette station , and the buffet food was above average lunch at the toscana was great again the buffet food was good , and the pasta station was amazing - choose your own ingredients and sauces for supper , we did not go to the agave , the spice , or the mediterranean restaurant chez isabelle ( french ) and the toscana ( italian ) were our favourites they were amazing and i do not understand how people complain because everyone there during our stay seemed to agree with us try the chateaubriand at chez isabelle the grill restaurant was also good the only disappointment was the lobster house i love lobster and had heard that it was not as good in the dominican , but i still held out hope well , it was not as good , and the other food was below the standard set by the other restaurants overall , the food was great service : everyone there was amazing the service was great everywhere on the resort such friendly people we had some repeated problems with our toilet , which probably could have ruined other people 's trips , but to us it was absolutely no big deal again , the staff went out of their way to make sure things were resolved activities : lots to do we played tennis , pool , volleyball , ping pong , and went horseback riding the nature park , the gym , the spa were also very good the activities staff is great , although sometimes it is hard to get the people motivated to get involved , and they were never pushy the nightly entertainment was good , not great this resort is not really tailored to young singles the nightlife is not very wild overall , this resort is amazing for a romantic getaway i would recommend it to anybody 
we adored the excellence beautiful grounds , impeccable service , outstanding and caring staff we stayed on the excellence club level our room faced the pool and ocean the concierge staff were gracious , helpful and extremely professional anna , ricardo and carlos rosario were most accomodating during our visit there are activities throughout the day to satisfy any need this resort is well planned and executed this was my first visit to an adult only ' resort and i loved it it was peaceful , quiet , the guests , well mannered and respectful of one another the two areas of concern , were the beds and dinner the mattresses were hard and we struggled to find entrees we liked in the varied restaurants often , they were mediocre at best we did however , find breakfast , lunch and two evening themed buffet dinners to be delicious the resort is approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport i would love to return and experience the beautiful and gracious hospitality of excellence , punta cana 
as advertised just returned from excellence ( feb 18-25) and it comes pretty much as advertised we read many of the reviews and they were very helpful beautiful resort , service is spectacular as noted by most everyone , rooms very nice , beach great , very breezy but without the breeze it would be really hot had read that the wait times for the restaurants could be lengthy , we did not find that we ate early ( no later than 7pm ) and never had to wait for a table some of the spots fill up a little later , but if you go early you will not have a problem food is quite good for the most part , some of the meat is a little chewey breakfast and lunch buffets very good we did as some others had recommended and took a pile of small bills for tipping and it was much appreciated ride from airport is as advertised , about an hour and lots of potholes on the road , but really not that bad there were no bugs when we were there a great resort for sitting by the pool or on the beach and just relaxing/reading can walk forever on the beach , either direction , and calmer waters to be found not to far from the resort , pretty rough out front of the resort if you are not one to sit and relax , probably not the best place for you not too many excersions offered , the city trip to santa dimingo is a 3 hour ride each way , for obvious reasons we did not go did do one excersion , the snorkel trip , think it was called mariniama its the recommended one where you swim with sharks and stingwrays i have snorkeled many places , this one is not that good you are in a fenced in area , picture about 30 people splashing around on the surface and the sharks and stingwrays below scrambling to stay away from all the noise on the plus side , the ride along the coast is beautiful and the drinks just keep on coming my comment on the availability of lounge chairs around the pool and beach , providing you stake out your spot by 8am , certainly not later than 9am , you should be fine beach towels are put out about 8am , and they go fast , as do the best spots we spent most of our time on the beach under one of the huts for shade , over near the vendor village fun to watch the vendors reaching out to anyone that comes anywhere near their stores , they go down to the waters edge to meet up with every passerby , and deliver the big sales pitch we ventured into their stores on our last day for a few souveniors one word of advise , get to know the value of things , shop around , they will try to fleece you they do not like to give you a price on any single item , they encourage you to collect everything you want and then give you a package deal , and the starting price will be absurd negotiate , negotiate , if you start to walk away , the price comes down real fast in summary , a very nice relaxing vacation , but i think my next holiday will have to include more off site opportunities there really is not much to see off the resort , but i think that pretty much applies to punta cana in general 
an excellent bump my wife and i were able to spend 10 wonderful days at the excellence from january 24 to feb 3 this year due to overbooking at the sirenis tropical this overbooking seemed to be quite frequent at a number of resorts in punta cana this year however , i am not complaining since our stay at the excellence far exceeded any previous all - inclusive we have ev er been on we met a number of people who had been bumped from other resorts to the excellence this was our first trip to the dominican since 2001 ( we have travelled to cuba the past 6 years ) , and we very impressed , not only with the resort but more so the staff the service was , as they say excellente the staff really know how to make your stay enjoyable they work very hard every day and always with a smile and hola juan , the little man at the pool bar was a real gentleman who always had a smile and always made sure your glass was full people who complain about the service should maybe wake up and smell the roses the staff work extremely hard to make everyones vacation enjoyable so what if you had to wait at some of the ala carte restaurants you 're on vacation so chill out , for heavens sake i forget how many people i heard complaining about the bad service because they could not be seated right away it was not bad service , it was just the pleasant young hostess trying to do her job and keep everyone happy my wife had occasion to visit the resort medical clinic due to a severe reaction to a little spider bite the doctor did an excellent job in getting her looked after again thank you for the great service rather than go into great detail regarding the features of the resort , i will try to summarize very briefly some of the highlights : the beach - 10 straight days of red flag the beach is gorgeous but very rough every day the pool - excellent very clean and quiet no problem getting a chair as mentioned , juan took good care of us to make sure we had a cold one at all times restaurants - excellent no where did we have a bad meal the service was great and the food good the buffet for breakfast had lots of choice , omelettes of choice , fresh fruit , breads , etc the grill , the french restaurant and the chinese restaurant were our favourites grounds - the grounds are immaculate , well manicured lots of chickens and turkeys running around beautiful flamingos in the pond at the front of the resort spa - very beautiful we did not use the services , but people we talked to said their services were excellent entertainment - hit and miss the staff work v ery hard to make their shows enjoyable for everyone the michael jackson show was well done as well as the circus show and the magic show however , they started a little late (10:00 p ) the sax player near the lobby bar was great checkin and checkout - painless when we checked in after being bumped at 2:00 a in the morning the gentleman who looked after us was great , and fully understood our inconvenience no hassle checkout when we departed in closing nolitours , who we booked through in canada came through big time we were able to stay at the excellence for our whole vacation , without the hassle of moving from one resort to the other which was nice there was also compensation for our inconvenience of being bumped so this was a nice gesture from them and was appreciated this is a great adults only resort , and we would recommend it to anyone who wants a romantic getaway you will not be disappointed 
amazing after reading reviews on this website i was quite concerned that hotel would not be up to the standard we were expecting but it was absolutely amazing , the hotel is fabulous , set in beautiful grounds and the people are so helpful and friendly , especially franklin and rosemary who both work in the entertainment team the food is great and with seven resturaunts to chose from you do not get bored horse riding is a must , a free half an hour is provided as part of your stay but we chose to pay for an hour and it was well worth it , we were taken to a lovely river great for photos i would also like to mention that bugs are not a problem , you may get bitten in the sports bar of an evening as its open plan but the hotel ground are fumigated on a daily basis we didnt have any problems i have stayed in several five star hotels and feel this hotel deserves its rating i would definately recommend it 
excellent without a doubt we arrived at night and were concerned with check in as we got off the bus we were greeted with a glass of champagne the front desk was very prompt to get us to our rooms and hector ) as we arrived in our suites they were spotless our luggage arrived 5 minutes later we travelled in a group of 11 our son 's room was at the opposite end of the resort but in the morning he was able to change to the floor below us we were starving and were able to get pizza at the restaurant until 2:00am room service was available 24/7 and was very quick the restaurants were very good if you liked to eat around 6:30 the longest wait was 10 minutes if you ate at 8:00pm the wait was longer every morning the breakfast buffet was in the toscana restaurant with everything from omelets to pancakes , fresh fruit , beef , chicken , smoothies and champagne service was quite good lunch was also a buffet in the toscana , the grill or lobster house the latter two were outdoor restaurants next to the pool lunch was again a wide variety and also they had takeout pizza breakfast and lunch was casual dress there was no buffet for dinner but you had the choice of 7 fine restaurants no reservations required the grill and lobster house were casual dress including shorts for the guys the grill was a steak grill and choices were from filet to rib eye , new york strips and a mixture platter with a little everything the lobster house was ok the appetizers and soup were great but the lobster was a bit soggy the other restaurants were dressier with long pants being required the best was the french chez isabelle food and service was excellent toscana and spice were also very good with a wide variety to choose from we never got to the agave or barcelona there were bars everywhere and service was top shelf polite staff and quick service premium liquor and beer showtime at night was very entertaining with dance troups , magicians , impersonaters , singers and folklore very professionally done the pool was probably the highlight it did not seem busy as it was more of a winding river you had to get out early for prime spots but there were plenty of chairs , beds and towels the swimup bar had excellent service with good seats the entertainment staff of whom i 'll mention ( carlos , joel , enisjuan carlos , julio , alexandra , rosemary , muriel , franklin ) were the friendliest and most accomodating always helping making your stay an event to remember oscar night and the outdoor dinner on the beach was first class we had homemade soup , pork a roasted hip of beef over fire , salds , desserts , drinks and great weather if there was anything to knock it would be the beach as every day the water was very rough great for boogie boarding the side trips biking , atv 's , snorkelling and scuba diving were very good and not expensive we found out that a little tip here and there went a long way the employee 's work hard and put in alot of hours so do not be afarid to tip them this vacation was a great time for our families and i would return tomorrow 
our punta cana excellence resort stay was wonderful the people , food , sun , surf , and pool were great the entertainment was excellent too juan carlos , altagracia , and lizette went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed to make our vacation extra special they are warm , helpful and very dedicated professionals as we strolled the resort at night we heard the most wonderful music coming from the santo domingo plaza domingo and rafael played the sax and keyboard with the full moon shining on the ocean and the stars twinkling above we danced to the most romantic sax we had ever heard the man is a genius playing his horns each night we made a point to see domingo and listen to the best music in the caribbean when we were departing from the resort domingo took the time to see us off for rick and cheryl , ricardo and carlotta , this very special friend touched our hearts and made returning to the punta cana excellence a must i encourage anyone who wants to spend some time in paradise to visit the punta cana excellence you wo not be disappointed 
this was not one of my favourite holidays my partner and i went in july to august for 14 days the holiday didnt start well as thomson , didnt give us our star class premium seats ( which we paid for 7 months prior ) , yet , they were upgrading people on the day then the cabin staff were very rude the room was very basic , and we were at the end of the resort we had to call maintance a few times due to things hanging off the walls also , what they dont tell you there are building works that were going on in the rooms a few doors away and they would not move us to another room be prepared to loose weight , the food is not much cop the only good thing was the desserts the bar staff benjammin was fab made you very welcome , he was the highlight take strong mosquitoe spray because of the ponds they have around the resort , and all of them are stagnant , the place was infested , they had to get rentakil out ( or who ever they use ) to try a rid the hotel of them i had over 30 bites and was that bad that i had to see the on site doctor ( very good by the way ) this meant i could not drink , could not sit in the sun , and unable to go on the beach , so spent my time in the room , but with the building works going on , i was not a happy bunny oh , what they dont mention in the brochures is that every other night they have locals come in trying to sell you their goods , this is straight through the centre of the hotel and if you want to get something to eat without going near them due to their rudeness and arrigance then i sugest room service the trip to swim with the dolphines and sharks was fab , but be prepared for a long drive back to the airport and about an hour flight to get to the sea life place and the plain has no aircon it was an amazing experience through i have to say that the best part of the holiday was booking a helicopter ride back to the airport on departure day you need to book this at the start of your holiday but well worth it , the view is amazing , and it is quicker only thing is , a taxi takes your suitcases and drops them off at the airport and then leave them unattended , so when you go looking for them , the thomson rep knows nothing about them and when you do find them , there are the local police standing round 
beautiful hotel my boyfriend , sister  her boyfriend stayed at the excellence from february 10-17 ( sunday - sunday ) brace yourself for a long ( and mostly positive ) review the ride : not too bad it took us about an hour to get there from the airport - we booked private transportation with dominican airport transfers i would do so again so that we could get there quickly in a private car there was one stretch of road that was really bad , but for the most part it was okay i like the drives - you get to see more of the country you are staying in outside of the resort check - in : great we got rooms quickly ( arrived around 3:30pm ) but chose to go grab some lunch at toscana first since we had not eaten since early that morning we got a nice cool towel plus a flute of champagne on arrival the guy at the desk said welcome home which i thought was a cute touch the room : i thought the room was pretty great we were in building 3 on the 2nd floor overlooking the garden in the back jacuzzi was really nice ( they filled it up with flowers one night ) and towel art on the bed several days as well two minor complaints though - the bed was the most uncomfortable thing i have ever slept on in my life my hipbones hurt me the entire week i was there since i 'm a side - sleeper the other minor issue we had was that there were no pillowcases on the pillows and they were strewn about the bed when we arrived i 'm sure it was just because they had not been cleaned yet ( they must do lots of laundry ) but it looked a bit unkempt when we walked in the room for the first time this was only an issue because i was a little worried that the room had not been cleaned before we arrived from the previous guests after that one instance , the room always looked spotless pool  beach : the pools were all just amazing we spent most of our time at the main pool , near the far end where it was quieter we spent a couple of days near the activities section as well , but it was more crowded and hard to get chairs there the beach was breathtaking by far , the softest sand i have ever walked on the water was a bit rough , but there were people swimming i saw a jet ski ( i 'm assuming for rescue after the tragic accident a few weeks ago ) and a lifeguard lots of palapas and hammocks restaurants : we went to several of the restaurants during our stay toscana ( breakfast and lunch ) : typical all - inclusive buffet food it was average , and i could always find something to eat only drawback was the number of flies i expected it since it 's the tropics , but they were not there at night , so i 'm not sure why they were so prevalent during the day we did not get to dinner here because of the 1 5 hour wait the grill ( lunch and dinner ) : lunch and dinner were great nice atmosphere overlooking the pools ricky was an outstanding waiter and made sure we got takeaway food when one of the people in our party got sick ( more on this later ) the filet mignon was pretty good , imo barcelona ( dinner ) : located in the same room as toscana on the far side i really enjoyed it ( try the shrimp and the steak ) chez isabelle ( dinner ) : went here our first night try the sea bass agave ( dinner ) : by far , our favorite restaurant great atmosphere , especially if you get a seat in the open air courtyard mariachi band , fantastic fajitas and margaritas all in all , the food was better than other all - inclusives i 've been to it 's not the best food i have ever eaten , but it was definitely good the only issue i have here was the wait times - the no reservations policy is nice in theory , but i question how it works when the resort is close to capacity imo - waiting for 1 5-2 hours just is not acceptable even when the drinks are already paid for we went restaurant hopping a few nights just to find a place that could seat us ( whether it was 2 or 4 of us ) if you went to dinner before 6:45 or after 9 you had better luck perhaps the resort needs to hire more wait staff during peak season so they can use more tables one more thing on the food - they need to get a snack bar type place so that you do not have to go in and have a sit - down lunch most days i would 've preferred grabbing a burger or sandwich , eating it quickly outside and then getting back in the sun or pool they had a couple of days where they made paella on the beach - we preferred that bars : loved cafe kafe and the sports bar julio cesar at the sports bar is just about the nicest guy ever the coco locos and miami vices were great during the day there is pool service and beach service available staff : hands - down great service all the bartenders and wait staff we encountered were phenomenal it definitely helps and it is appreciated if you speak spanish ( which i  my sister do ) it 's not necessary to know the language , though plenty of english speakers to be found it was kind of like karaoke with dancing for a few of them the michael jackson show is hyped way more than it should be imo we liked the circus and magic show better miscellaneous : we did the zipline excursion and it was awesome it 's not too far from the resort ( about 30 min drive , plus another 20 to get up the mountain ) i would 100% do that again i really liked the newsletter that housekeeping put in our room every evening at turn - down it helped you figure out what you wanted to do the next day we played tennis several days - you need to make reservations decent courts and racquets are available 
the best all - inclusive we 've found my wife and i just returned from 10 days at excellence punta cana and want to share our opinion bottom line , this is the best all - inclusive we have ever visited ( we 've been to six not a lot , but this place is something special ) very romantic and luxurious you can get the details about the property off the web site , but we want to give you our overall pluses and minuses first , the positives :1) the facility ( buildings , pools , architecture , layout , landscaping , etc ) is stunning an enormous lobby and adjoining areas with vaulted roofs and polished marble spacious and luxurious rooms ( we were in garden view and were very pleased ) a large theater for nightly entertainment , beautiful gardens and fountains , plenty of beachfront and poolside chairs , hammocks , beds and shades the beach is endless and wonderful to walk the nearest resorts are quite a distance away 2) the staff is immpeccably trained , very friendly and accommodating , and seems sincerely interested in your having a great time on occasion there are language barriers ( like trying to special - order something in one of the restaurants ) but many staff have a great command of english even the groundskeepers and construction workers smile and greet you every time you pass by i ca not remember all the names , but several waiters were extremely friendly and delightful to talk with and our thanks to madeline at the concierge desk she helped make our valentine 's day very special the variety of restaurants provides something for every taste we especially liked chez isabelle ( french ) , spice ( asian ) and the grill ( steakhouse ) and ate twice at each toscana ( italian ) was very good barcelona and the lobster house were disappointing and we never ate at agave , the mexican restaurant the food is well above average do not expect the french laundry or daniel this is the caribbean after all but my wife and i were very happy with the quality of the food offered the diversity of guests americans , canadians , brits , germans , russians , dutch , french and these are just the folks we met we like the international feel of the resort we are gin drinkers , and had bombay saphire ( our poison of choice ) , beefeater , tanqueray , and gordon 's to choose from chivas regal scotch , grand marnier , frangelico , bailey 's and the tropical drinks are tasty and cold waiters take your order on the beach and around the pool what could be sweeter we love our grandkids , but getting away from screaming rugrats is important too now some negatives :1) while the beach is beautiful and well - appointed , the surf at the resort is rough and the current is strong while we were there you were not allowed out past your waist the lifeguards are very vigilant the body surfers and boogie - borders loved it , but just standing in waist - deep water was a workout luckily there is a quiet and beautiful sheltered swimming area about 500 yards down the beach south of the resort ( but no lifeguards ) and the pools are fantastico no brewed decaf coffee only instant decaf so we drank high test for a week lots of smokers at home i 've gotten used to public areas being smoke - free but between the europeans , the american smokers , and the lure of dominican cigars we often had to move around to avoid tobacco smoke luckily much of the resort is open air and the smoke quickly cleared we are tennis players , and the tennis courts are shaky right now they have open two clay courts ( actually compressed shale with sand on top ) and one hard court under renovation , but the pro says they are converting to two hard courts and one clay court the pro , rolando , is a very amiable guy , a good teacher , and does a very good job with a very limited facility court time is free , lessons are cheap , and rolando will set you up with other guests with whom to play i sure hope we do not sound too negative these minuses in no way diminish the extremely positive regard we have for excellence punta cana in a second would we recommend it to friends and family if you want a romantic , isolated , adults - only tropical experience with much better - than - average food and drink this is a place to consider 
a vacation to remember we stayed in room 14106 wich is a suite that they upgraded us to for no cost the view from this room was breathtaking , on the left we had all the local vendors , to the right we had the pool and behind the pool were the giant blue waves of the ocean you could say we had the best of both worlds the interior of the room was like nothing i had stayed in before absolutely spoiled rotten king size bed , jacuzzi tub , all the extras you could want we had a few issues with some stuff but nothing to complain about room sevice was great the food always a little diferent but always good they usually had it there between 25 and 60 minutes minni bar was usually full had to call once to have it refilled the pool and the beach is the reason we came to the resort known as excellence it was the best i had seen by far we sat by the pool for hours on end sipping bora boras and sammy sosas prepared for us by juan and carlos m ( sammy sammy sammy ) they were the best bartenders by far they can be found at sol right next to beach and pool we never had to wait for drinks they made them before we even asked for them , now thats what i call service the restraunts were nice the food was always good we had room service most of the time for dinner so we did not go to all of them the lunch at the grill was great they even had mgd for you american beer lovers breakfast was good but a little crowded unless you ate at the lobster house the only bad part about the lobster house was in the morning it smelled like fish if the wind blew in the right direction the servings are small so order extra , they will bring all the food you want room service for breakfast was very good to i 'm a very picky eater and enjoyed there food very much we had one incident when we left that we were not to fond of but the resort is taking care of it for us , at least they said they would we will see all in all it was the best vacation i had ever been on 8 days of sun and drinks with just the wife and i it was kind of like a honeymoon in paradise but it was not our honeymoon we left the dr it was 85 degrees we got home and it was -20 degrees we wanted to come back ( sorry if my spelling is a little off they never invited me to the spelling bee when i was in school if you know what i mean lol ) 
i would go back tomorrow if i could this vacation was the most amazing vacation i have ever been on i went with a group of 10 people with ages ranging from 20 years old to 55 years old we all had a wonderful time and had tons of fun the service was out of this world and the people were so friendly the rooms were beautiful and very clean the food was very good and breakfast was my personal favorite the entertainment was excellent i loved going to the spanish classes with franklin he was an excellent teacher others that i enjoyed included inus , mariel , juan carlos and andres we had a lot of fun with them playing volleyball and other games they kept us always having a good time being a 20 year old , i still had a good time at the excellence resort it is not just a couples resort because i am a single girl and still had an excellent time i would recommend the resort to anyone i plan on going back in less than a year 
excellence lived up to its name our thrid trip to the dr , this time after a 5 year absence the staff at excellence was really up to the task , from the first impression antonio at the bell stand got us going right away , and checked up on us throughout our stay i never had the bell stand follow up after getting bags to the room roberto , the excellence club , sara in the lobby bar area ,  carlos in 'animacion ' were other employees who really made efforts to insure fun and no worries the grounds are well kept with a large , pristine beach , very large pool , and 8 restaurants to choose from rooms were very nice as well , clean additionally , they just opened a new fitness center with all new equipment it is really a big improvement , plan on working out on vacation they also have nightly shows that are well worth staying up for , unlike other resorts that we have stayed at one thing lacking , no food at the pool you have to cover up and go to a restaurant for this as for the food , it is very good diverse menus and themes 
highly recommended overall a fantastic resort the food was incredible - especially the french and asian cuisine yes , you have to wait sometimes but they give you a pager of sorts which notifies you when your table is ready the staff is very attentive and friendly the rooms and grounds are clean and well kept - twice daily housekeeping service someone is always waiting on you hand and foot to bring drinks and there is a pizza delivery guy who brings pizza to the pool and beach the only downsides were that my ipod was stolen ( my own fault as i left it out while we were swimming ) and a two minute long distance call to canada cost us $42 us this was not obvious at the time of calling use the internet service instead - much cheaper 
beautiful hotel we had a wondedrful , happy champagne and hot towels reception the entrance to the hotel is very spectacular our suite was overlooking the waterfall pool and it was lovely to walk through the scented and colourful gardens every day , after a small 10 dollars tip , our maid scattered flowers in the bathroom and made swans out of the towels , a delight to return to after a day in the sun we did have a real problem getting in to the lobster and french restaurants , but after complaining to the hotel manager , service improved we had absolutely no problems with pool or beach towels the beach is stunning , but the waters are dangerous even for strong swimmers a short 5 minute stroll takes you tgo the calm blue carribean sea and we swam safely in paradise overall , a good hotel , my only criticism is that chocolate bars and alcohol other than beer should be included in the mini bars we took mosquito spray and had no problems with being bitten the swimming pool is alongside the beach and is so pretty 
a mixed blessing just returned from excellence punta cana with my husband and a good friend i would have liked to give this resort an excellent review , but honestly ca not because of the poor wait service in the dining rooms even though the hotel says it has 10 restaurants , several of them ( chez isabella , agave ) are extremely small and very understaffed and the staff that is there has obviously not been trained we met one guest who was fuming after waiting 1 1/2 hours to be seated and then another 2 hours to get his food other problems included a constant shortage of pool towels , rooms that were not made up until 5:00 pm , several power outages ( one lasting over 10 hours ) if you try to communicate with the staff at reception , or practically any other place the standard answer is  wait ten minutes on the plus side , when you do get your food , it is almost consistently very good , the beach is superb , the grounds are very well maintained , the security staff is alert , the rooms are spacious and the spa is great and easy to book 
good but too expensive for what you have first , it is a 4 stars hotel the first employees of the week are great but the second employees and the reception are very cold few employes had a smile at our arrival the food is excellente and the room are very clean the room service is good but do not expect any ' 'goodies ' ' like special towel animals of things like that every day in your room they change the bed , towel , clean the room and filled the bar the concierge has a great service for all your demand but all others employees do not follow her instruction precisely and she have to confirm if the job is done right the real problem is the dinner part they do not have buffet only 7 restaurants and they do not take reservations 2 times in the week , they have closed 3 restaurants so all the people are going to the others and imagine there is always lines outside all restaurants except if you are only 2 persons you wait few minites all the time you have to expect a late dinner the food is also great but do not take the lobsters restaurant no choice in the menu the show at night are ok 5 shows for dancers , one singer and one little circus do not expect a great show no fantasies but it is entertaining we had few cuts of electricity and missed water 2 times in our room the beach is great for my conclusion : it is a good 4 stars hotel not 5 stars and way too expensive for what you have today 
indifferent my wife and i stayed from dec 29th to jan 5th we have been to the dominican republic before but at a 3 star resort this touted itself as a 5 star first off the disclaimer i 'm a brit who lives in the us i have traveled all over so feel i have a somewhat objective view however , i have come to realize that 5 star hotels differ and one should go into each stay with an open mind that said , i would not consider this resort 5 star compared to us 5 star hotels arrival : easy , but be prepared for the drive the locals are embarrassed by the roads so do not make a big deal of it i have noticed many more people taking helicopters and i understand why i 'm sure the roads are a political issue and that tourism will drive road improvements make sure you know who your travel agency is once you clear immigration because it can get a little bit hectic and confusing once you clear immigration departure - an absolute mess maybe it was because we left on a saturday but it 's poorly sign posted and slow i would not recommend you pay the guys to walk your bags to the ticket gate as the distance is less than 50 yards if you go to the business class line and you are not traveling business class , you will be turned around only after you get to the desk or luggage check do not worry when you hear on the pa system that your plane is boarding it took us an hour to get through check out , and 5 minutes to get through customs and immigration our plane started boarding 30 minutes before we cleared the ticket counter yet took off an hour or so later i think it 's a common experience at the airport so do not panic , they wo not leave without you at least 20 people , if not more came onboard after us hotel : nice grounds , okay shops , okay food they do not take reservations and there are no buffet style restaurants even at breakfast you have to wait to be seated i do not think this worked well and we had to wait 20-40 minutes to be seated for lunch we often ate at the excellence club same for breakfast i was not expecting outstanding food but i was expecting a little bit better than i got at the 3 star i stayed at last time , the food was okay and i expected it to be okay this time the food was better but i expected it to be significantly better not gourmet , but consistantly better spice was solid , the gril also the italian was really disappointing we were there for new year 's eve where they served a fixed menu unfortunately , the menu was 80% sea food , neither of which my wife and i eat thus we got room service this was a tad disappointing for us what really surprised me was the inability to get a snack at lunch , unless at the excellence club some cafe in the middle of the grounds , near the pool where you could grab a sandwich to take back to your lounge chair or a burger drinks excellent as was the entertainment rooms were okay i do not expect too much from a resort in the dr where the threat of hurricanes means design and cost are kept to a minimun we did upgrade although the bathroom and shower were really small expected a little bit more from the patio i certainly would notr say it was pleasant to sit out on the patio at night to enjoy the view , sititng on plastic chairs on a tiny deck i noticed very few people chose to use their patios on the garden facing side tv is predominantly us channels : tbs , ae , tnt , cnn , fox etc a few european channels thrown in and then there 's the hard core porn channel this really surprised me channel 21, everyone on the resort knew channel 21 right in between regualr channels was the hard core porn and trust me , it 's hard core the resort does not cater to children at all if you have young kids , stay at the serenis resort down the road your kids will be bored at excellence if you do take young adults , be prepared to block the porn channel you have adult coontrols , i think on the menu screen before you settle into your room , make sure everything works this includes the safe , tv etc if not , it might be easier to switch rooms than get a replacement , especially in high season maid service , solid but time wise they were sporadic i would not complain if they came between 9-12 each day , but sometimes they came at 9 sometimes 5pm that 's just not good enough we tipped from the beginning but it did not seem to have an impact on the timeframe you really do not want to come back to a room at the end of the day to find it 's not cleaned , because then you have to wait on them they were also inconsistant with the cleaning some days they would leave wash cloths , other they did not we used them everyday and requested them everyday , so could not understand why they did not just leave them in the room same goes for beach towels some days they would leave 1 sometimes none again not a huge complaint and nothing that would ruin a holiday or even dent one 's spirits , but if you want to be a 5 star hotel , service has to be consistant i think my wife and i used that word more than any other to criticise the place pool area is excellent beach beautiful and you can walk for hours without being distrubed the ocean is as dangerous as everyone mentions you will feel it as soon as you walk in i could feel my ankles being pulled 
very dangerous visitors to the dominican republic must know that this resort as well as the dominican republic government have no safety standards or procedures in place for emergencies i was at this resort in december ( which is supposed to be 4 or 5 star but really was more like 3 at best ) and there was a an american man who drowned in the waters because there were no lifeguards on duty and the waters were very dangerous the undertow and currents were very strong the only warning system they had were these red flags but you would not notice them unless you looked for them , and even then if you did not know what a red flag meant you would not think to stay out of the water there were lots of others in the water too a canadian man tried to rescue the american because there was no help from staff but he himself was swept away by the ocean currents it has been a terrible experience and i for one will never return to the dominican republic until i know that it would be safer for me and my family my heart goes out to the families of the american man and the canadian hero who tried to save him 
amazing and tranquil my boyfriend and i are very well travelled and have experienced everything from camping in remote jungles to the ritz in new york we stayed at the excellence punta cana and loved it to address some of the previous and recent reviews , the week prior to us staying there , there were some fatalities in the waters in the area as such , there were at least two lifeguards on duty at all times - sometimes three any time someone was venturing out a little too far from the shore for their liking , they would blow their whistles and have them come back in an excellent and prudent action on the part of the hotel the meals were amazing not once did we have to wait to be seated in any of the restaurants that were all dinner menu based the lobster house is very romantic - with the ocean breezes blowing tthough as you at by candlelight the grill had excellent choices and cuts of meat to choose from the barcelona had tasty seafood and mediterranean styled dishes to choose from the asian restaurtant ( ca not recall the name ) had wonderful chinese , japanese and thai foods the mexican restaurant ( agave ) was in a cozy cantina setting the french restaurant was closed most of the time we were there , so we did not get to try it the only buffet style meals were in the morning and lunch in one of the restaurants even then , the buffet was excellent the staff was very friendly and attentive contrary to what others have posted , if there was ever a problem ( which we had with our fridge and a dripping tap in our room ) it was quickly fixed the fridge was making a bit of a shrieking sound we called the front desk and someone was at our door within 5 minutes they checked it out , and came back while we went for dinner and when we returned , the problem was fixed the tap was also fixed when we were at the beach very few hotels we have stayed at have been so responsive to issues such as that the beach is outstanding i can understand that if someone paid extra for the club excellence , they were be saddened by the fact that anyone could use the club excellence reserved beach area - which we did but , there is plenty of room to share and not be annoyed by other guests in your space the beach is magnificant another thing noticeable was the absence of vendors pestering you on the beach they would stay outside the designated beach area assigned to the resort on each end of the resort beach , there were small stores open to buy souveniers , if you so desired it was ultimately relaxing the rooms were clean and the maid/turn down service was always timely and well done 24 hour room service was taken advantage of several times and it never failed to deliver in very short order we even ordered ( quite by accident ) from the club excellence menu and it was delivered to our room without question it was only after the fact that we noticed there was a separate menu for that particular upgrade we would stay at the excellence again and would recommend it to anyone the only thing we would recommend against is paying more for the club excellence - the standard accomodation is more than adequate and enough to keep you pampered we loved it and ca not wait to go back 
absolutley amazing my husband and i travel a great deal - and this two week vacation was truly amazing we were blown away be the hotel , the room , pools , staff etc when we arrived we were escorted to the excellence check in ( an extra charge but worth every penny roberto checked us in - and was the most efficient , courteous and friendly person during check in , the staff grabbed us some ice cold beer so we start our vacation right away - again - during the check in roberto remembered our names and would address us at any location in the hotel - nice touch the food was really good - and enjoyed the champagne and oj every morning - nice treat loved the french restaruant 99% of the staff were absolutely great - and provided excellent service it was very easy to be served beverages ( we 've been to lots of places where it 's been quite the struggle - definately not here ) the one must do thing you have to do is the lobster dinner on the beach with surprises included we would definately go back to this hotel - ( provided we can leave our daughter at home ) : - ) 
nothing spectacular my boyfriend and i visited the excellence from december 26th to january 2nd , 2008 we had the excellence club junior swim - up suite i typed a thorough review that i hope all those looking to visit the resort will read we went as a very objective pair and this is simply what we found trip to and from the airportwe booked a private taxi to take from the airport the roads really are as bad as the reviews all say , and i 've traveled on some pretty bad roads in the west indies both boyfriend and i were quite nauseous by the time we pulled up to the excellence if you can afford it , i suspect that helicopter travel is the way to go we considered doing that on the way back but learned too late that bags must be transferred by taxi and did not have enough time to send them along the roads are very potholed and bumpy and , of course , the driving is crazy - but if you 've been anywhere in the caribbean , you already know that and are used to it : ) ride back was about the same expect the trip to take between an hour and an hour and a half arrivalarrival was impressive , actually the lobby area and is expansive and airy and quite beautiful as we were in the excellence club , we checked in through them it was expedient and courteous we received cool , mint - scented towels and champagne upon arrival , which we enjoyed we were given a quasi - tour of the excellence club and shown to our room rather quickly no orientation though no big deal , we were super tired at that point anyway us air managed to lose all of our baggage on the way down , which was slightly impressive ( and certainly not the resort 's fault ) , and the excellence was actually quite helpful in helping us track it down roomthe room was a disappointment the room had one wall painted hot pink and the pillars and trim were the same color the jacuzzi in - room was cool the room was quite small for a suite and not grandeur in the slightest our jacuzzi drain turned out to be broken and leaked at an impressive rate it did not stop me from taking a bath , but i had to keep my foot on the drain in order to push it in far enough the patio door was broken and did not lock , nor did it close properly and caused the a/c to be very spotty however , when the a/c worked , it worked our room remained quite cool even through all that the bathroom was very small and the shower was exceptionally wee the showerhead was nice , though our toilet refused to flush unless you held the handle down for the entire flush the bvlgari toiletries were a welcome surprise but we had troubles getting them restocked during our weeklong stay face cloths are very hard to come by someone could make a fortune by starting a shop that only offered face cloths there : ) minibar is kind of a travesty , they 've got some nuts and crackers but lots of drinks since we were in the excellence club we had premium alcohol but never ended up drinking in our room tv was medium sized and satellite was terrible not that you go there to watch tv , necessarily , but i like to watch a bit before i go to bed and speaking of the bed it 's like sleeping on a cement block wait - a cement block would be more comfortable both boyfriend and i woke up our first morning there all kinds of sore and in pain we wound up ordering 10 pillows from housekeeping to put over the mattress and sleep on it worked out okay - bit lumpy though : ) housekeeping was highly amused at this bed curtains were half on , half hanging off no canopy on the bed which i thought looked strange floors got very very very slippery if you tracked any water in whatsoever - even be super careful just getting out of the shower we nearly wiped it quite a few times also be careful when you take a warm jacuzzi the humidity causes the floor to dew up a bit and therefore it gets extremely slippery again speaking of dewy floors , the linens tended to be damp , i expect because of the humidity in the region still very disconcerting when you climb into a damp bed : p housekeeping was pretty good and did a decent job we kept strange hours ( we like to sleep late ) and they worked around it pretty well i ca not say we ever once got turndown service , though that was disappointing i was looking forward to those towel animals : ) and we tipped generously we had ultra - finicky wifi that also chose not to work 90% of the time in - room it was okay - ish when you stepped outside , though not the absolute worst ever , but not great we spent new years eve there and i do have to say that the meal they served for that was very good however , we did not have that experience anywhere else i do not advocate ordering steak boyfriend and i ate at toscana twice and both times ended up becoming ill - i was sick enough to throw up all night boyfriend managed to keep it down somehow spice was quite good though , as well as barcelona we ate at the grill for lunch quite often and food is not bad there be warned that every version of chicken tastes exactly the same , whether you order it jerk , plain , or otherwise one of their favorite things to say here is that reservations are not necessary i beg to differ every time we went to lunch we had an hour+ wait time once we stood in line at the grill for a half hour before the hostess even deigned to walk over and take down our information so we could go sit down at the bar to wait dinner was also an hour+ it did not really matter what time you went to eat they say the 'busy ' times are from 7:30 to 8:30 but if we went previous to this or after it we had a long wait either way service is so - so but do not expect anything grand 
very enjoyable my wife and i just returned from a stay at excellence punta cana and we had a great time rooms : we stayed in a garden view room the view was of a small garden area and the back of the main building it was not a great view , but quite frankly , i was not there to look out the window the room had a slight mold/musty smell however , it was not enough to bother us much the bed was hard but comfortable the shower had great water pressure and warm/hot water was plentiful the in - room jacuzzi was great and relaxing food : the food was generally good breakfast and lunch at the tuscan were buffet style these were good , but not great breakfast at the lobster house was sit down and was better they had a few egg dishes that were very tasty lunch at the grille was also sit down and was better than the tuscan i had a shrimp dish that was particularly good as well as a steak kebob dinner was generally a step up in quality the tuscan was probably the weakest restaurant of all spice had good asian food the lobster house was also good - however , if you do not like lobster - you 're going to be very hungry we liked barcelona the best and ate their two times we ordered room service one morning and it was ok we ordered the food the night before and it was delivered right on time the following morning the french toast was not amazing , but not awful either bottom line , you wo not go hungry the husband of the couple we travelled with was a vegetarian and he was able to find acceptable meals as well service at all of the restaurants was a bit slow expect a meal to take an hour to and hour and a half the resort : the resort is very pretty the beach is beautiful the ocean is definitely not tranquil the first couple of days we were there , the weather was a bit stormy and the wind was very strong as a result , the waves were considerable we did a little body boarding even once the weather turned nice , the waves were still large and frequent in front of the lobby , there is a small lagoon with flamingoes , ducks , turkeys , and two parrots beware the parrots they will climb on you and they will eat the buttons off of your clothes there are turtles in the small pond inside the lobby the grounds and pool are well maintained and they seem to be doing constant updates the staff is very friendly and helpful it was my wife 's birthday and i ordered a cake for her the cake was promptly delivered to us at the restaurant in addition , they decorated our room with ballons many of the guests smoke , so if this is a problem for you , you will have problems at some of the activities/events it is very important to note that the resort is an hour away from the airport it is also an hour away from some of the excursions do not go to this resort if you are looking to be in the middle of the action activities : do not take the bike tour it is a waste of time and not very pretty the horse excursion is excellent - they take you on a 1/2 hour to 1 hour trip we took the streching and aerobics class every morning and they were generally good and fun we also made good use of the volleyball court on the beach , the clay tennis courts , the ping pong ball and pool tables the night club is pleasant , but do not expect to hear anything from earlier than 2000 they play a mix of latin , hip hop and carribean music we went on the snorkeling excursion and had a great time the coral reef we went to was filled with fish and very scenic we also snorkeled with some nurse sharks and stingrays in an enclosed area that was interesting as well we did not do the atv trip however , we talked to some people who did and they said the trip was fantastic so long as you were willing to get covered in mud my wife used the spa twice and said it was excellent i used the exercise room a couple of times the equipment is good , but unfortunately they do not have any tvs in the room in addition , the exercise room is upstairs and not air - conditioned as a result it is very hot expect to loose some serious weight entertainmentthe entertainment is acceptable i was not expecting much and so i was not dissapointed the magic act was polished , however , he did not do any original trics we spent most of the time figuring out the secret 's beind the tricks the dance shows were high energy and reasonably entertaining the singer chris blizzard was ok , but do not expect him to sing anything other than ballads and easy listening the piano bar was also not that great one of the gentlemen we met was actually a professional piano bar player in texas he played a few songs and was much better than the person the resort hired i would not go to one of these resorts if you are looking for great entertainment we knew what we were in for , we set our expectations low and were pleasantly surprised overallwe had a fantastic time the resort met all of our expectations 
i am only telling you what i wish i had known my boyfriend and i just returned from excellence punta cana we vacationed there from december 7th to december 16th there were some quirkiness about the place that made the resort less than perfect but i definitely think it was worth the money if you are younger than 45, you wo not have many people your age to socialize with my boyfriend is in his forties and was overwhelmed by the number of old people slowly strolling around the resort we really need to young this place up the beds are hard this is the hardest bed i 've ever slept on in my life it rains everyday most times it only rains for 10 minutes or so , but if you love to sun - bathe , you will notice that rain comes out of nowhere it does not get cold , yet i was afraid to fall asleep by the pool or on the beach out of 9 days it rained 8 out of those eight days , it rained all day on one day i love the rain and find it romantic but when your room has not been cleaned yet and you are participating in elementary school rainy day activities , it can be annoying i was glad it only rained hard one day lunch is terrible the pizza is tolerable do not miss toscana for breakfast or you are screwed until 6pm when dinner starts room service is not good either i only liked the penne and after a while i hated that too also , room service are the only rude people on the entire staff , ignore them everyone else has the best customer service i have ever experienced make friends with matias at the front desk ext 6032 he is the only person you need to know in customer service make friends with the party girls and guys at allegro , the disco if you are under 45, or feel under 45, go there for fun if you are jealous - hearted , this is not the place for you the girls and guys are very attractive and very sweet and they are all flirts by nature have fun with them housecleaning gets a little lazy , if you are tipping them , call them on it do not let them overlook things , they move very fast due to the amount of rain , ants will come i 'd suggest making sure the housecleaning staff sprays for ants read tripadvisor 's what to pack forum it will make your stay better tea tree oil saved my bf who always gets bitten by mosquitos he was only bitten the day he did not use off or bathe with tea tree oil a couple of drops of the oil in the bath tub and a thick lotion like bath and body works body butter does wonders also , bring a few collar shirts and long pants for your man if he is a casual dresser you do not want him wearing the same thing every night you go out to eat also , if you go dancing later , you do not want him dirtying up all of the clothes he needs to wear for the dress code at the restaurants also , pack lots of sun dresses and coverups bring sandals that are comfortable to dance in but also dress up your outfit when you go dancing learn to say a few things in spanish the staff appreciates it and it will get you special favors a smile does not hurt either things break in the room , and the cable goes out often for the things that break , like the a/c and the jacuzzi tub , there is 24 hour maintenance and they will fix it before you 've finished your drink in the lobby everything else not mentioned was wonderful , from the staff to the drinks , spa , workout room , grounds i read every review on excellence before i left listen to them all of those people are telling the truth figure out which things are flukes and which things are consistent among all of the travelers do not sweat the small stuff , you are in a third world country 
great vacation my girlfriend and i stayed at excellence from nov 30th till dec 6th we are 25 years old we took an 8 am flight and landed early from nj we got our bags and cleared customs very quickly we got in a bus with about 12 other people headed to various resorts a bus ride that would normally take 1 hour took us 1 hour 45 minutes due to traffic and the fact that our bus got a flat tire the bus driver had to pull over on the side of the road and change the tire while we were all in the bus it was some experience when we arrived at excellence around 3pm we were welcomed with a glass of champagne and a cold towel check in was very quick we stayed in building 10 our room was very nice - king size bed and a large jacuzzi , fully stocked mini bar turn on channel 21 for a treat it is a 24 hour free porn channel the hotel lobby is very nice with all sorts of animals - turtles , parrots , flamingos there are 2 pools 1 huge pool that winds through the resort with a pool bar and a separate cascade waterfall pool the cascade pool was kind of boring as there were not a lot of people there the main pool was very nice get there early to reserve a good seat the beach was beautiful with plenty of chairs and shade only disappointing thing was that the water was to rough all week to allow for any water activities the entertainment staff was awesome mariel , ines , rey , andres , and especially anny - mrs mamma juamama ( some kind of punta cana rum drink ) they were all so friendly and always wanted you to play games they were so much fun there were a bunch of activities to do during the day pool volleyball , horseback riding , different pool games the restaurants were all very good our favorite was chez isbella the french restaurant but they were all good the only restaurant we didnt try was the lobster house the shows at night were very good we really liked the magic show , circus show , and michael jackson show we didnt really care for the international show or dominican show the resort has a small casino which is hit or miss depending on what time you go the resort lost power twice during our stay so that was a minor inconvience the night club is fun and the entertainment staff gets everybody up and dancing overall it was a great vacation and a great resort we recommend this place 
great time at excellence we just got back from the excellence in punta cana and had a magnificent time this place was almost perfect ( the food could be improved ) all of the suites had a two person jacuzzi tub the pool was the width of the resort we spent our days floating in the pool ( without the sound of children ) drinking coco locos you must try the coco locos i think we might have drained their supply of young coconuts we napped in the huge beds on the beach and by the pool we had a bottle or two of champagne every meal it was wonderful there is a dress code at the resort and people were dressed well food comments : the food could use improvement the best restaurant for breakfast and lunch is toscana - - do not just go to the salad bar , there is a grilling station and a pasta station the best restaurant was chez isabelle the bouillabaise , chateau briand , rack of lamb were delicious do not try their crawfish entree it smelled weird and take a pass on the beef tartar the lobster house was okay - - could have been better - - just take it with garlic and butter do not order it with chili butter no chili unless you like your lobster smothered with tabasco all in all we had a wonderful time 
excellence was excellente we spent 3 nights at the excellence resort with 4 other couples the resort is absolutely beautiful our rooms were all amazing and very clean the food was great in some restaurants , and not so great in others spice and tuscana were 2 of the best you have plenty of time to relax , and there are also lots of activities for those who are interested we played beach volleyball everyday one of the best things about this resort are the staff they were all so friendly and enthusiastic i would like to mention julio , ray , mariel , andre , jesus , and franklin in particular we all had the best time with them they are extremely hard workers from morning to night we had a great time with them at the disco every night they are a main part of the reason this resort is so wonderful if we could change one thing about our visit , it would have been that we could have stayed longer we all plan on going back next year for longer than 3 nights this is the best and most beautiful resort that we have been to you wo not be disappointed 
not as advertised with such great reviews , i did not think we could go wrong that was my first mistake upon our arrival , we were told that the hotel had overbooked and our room was unavailable ( we traveled the week before thanksgiving ) while this can happen i did not expect to hear that because of this situation our room would be downgraded i had reserved my room over 8 months earlier and was obviously upset that we were not notified earlier of the situation we were offered $130 credit per night that could be used at the resort does anyone else think it 's funny that money i paid for a room i was not going to be put in should stay at the resort when i said i would only accept a cash refund or credit back on my card a room miraculously opened up for our second night to the end of our vacation they then informed me that i was lucky because that meant some other couple would not be staying in the room they reserved kept thinking i do not feel lucky for getting what i paid for in the end , we stayed one night in a downgraded room , and then were moved to the room i had booked as if our arrival was not fun enough , our bag was delivered to the wrong room i had to argue with the bell staff that the bag they were trying to give me was not mine they were insistent that it was over an hour later , and a few rum punches to make it seem funnier than it was , our bag was found in someone else 's room and brought to us our first night we dined at the lobster hut while it is not maine lobster , it was good however , upon ordering a glass of house red wine we were amazed to be told they were out mind you , we have paid for an all inclusive vacation and there are 5 other restaurants within a 2 minute walk that all had the wine we were shown the wine list and asked if we wanted to purchase a bottle of red wine are these people nuts i really could go on and on about the poor service however i am done a vacation is what you make of it and my husband and i did come home relaxed we learned to laugh the stuff off and await the next one the alcohol helps it all seem better do take bug spray and lots of sun screen it rained every day on us , but running out of sunscreen will cost you a minimum of $18 a bottle disposable cameras will set you back $30 the spa is worth a treatment and the daily specials are a good deal another thing to note is there are a lot of smokers if you are used to non - smoking environment this might get to you the closed air restaurants are smoke free , but the open air ones are not the lobby is also smoking and when it is raining , they lower screens that keeps the air from moving it really tends to build up if you are already going , i hope you have a great time 5-3 star place trying to disguise as a 5 star 
all inclusive resort my husband and i have just come back from an excellente trip to the dominican republic at the excellence punta cana we had the best service that one could ever be provided with ( even though there were a few snags along the way when we arrived we were meet by friendly and curtious staff , a cool face cloth to fresh - in - up with and impecable water gardens both outside and in at the front desk we were disappointed to find out the room we requested was not available but we were offered ( by edwin ) a better one starting the next day the front desk clerk , edwin , accommodated us with the least amount of inconvience for us : ) in our room our 4 post king size bed was not to hard nor to soft , with a two person jucuzzi tub , beautiful marble tile floors , shower and counter top and national art work painted on our vaulted ceiling the food was very good at all in - house ( included ) restaurants and our favorite was the french restaurant and ( believe - it - or - not ) the buffet all restaurant and bar staff seemed authentic when they say it was my pleasure to serve you or if you asked them how there day is they sincerely would say excellente the only other service problem we had was when i was trying to get a laundry service bagand a room service menu ( that was missing ) many front desk clerks and the concierge tried to help but there was miss communication between them and the maid service , finally i went and explained the situation to edwin at the front desk and he personally gave me the room service menu and called the maid service to insure reciept of a laundry service bag then to insure that it went well edwin called to make sure i had recieved it and was happy he definitely made our stay at the excellence punta cana much more relaxed and enjoyable ( i hope he does the training for all the front desk staff so the next time it is even better and that is the only area of improvment needed ( which is not much ) ) the weather when we were there is between 27 - 32 degrees with a warm wind and perfect water temp the beach was cleaned up every morning from all wood and debris that floated in at night the only excursion we went on was the marinarium which was the shark and sting - ray swim it was very exciting the only thing we did not enjoy was the coco - loco rum party on the boat after we did the swim just not our bag i give the excellence punta cana a two - thumbs - up review 
great staff , great  we came with lots of sandals experience in various countries we had never been to the dominican before but we 're definately coming back the staff here is well trained and have more energy than many caribbean countries if you treat them with respect , they return the favour with a smile and lots of attention the beach is a churning , angry sea and since we live on the atlantic coast , this was more than okay like combining a sunny southern holiday with a major storm from a wave perspective we loved it and spent each day watching the huge waves crash on the very sandy shoreline it 's a beatuiful beach long and uncrowded the restaurants offer a wide variety and the food was good to very good even though i did not like everything on the menu ( so i did not order those things ) , there was always something very good to pick from we ate at the french restaurant twice for the foie gras alone the food may not be up to a top restaurant but we found no problems if you 're fussy , then lower your expectations before you come , tip a bit , and the staff will do everything to make your meal very enjoyable overall , we 're already planning our next visit and we have not even left yet ignore the fussy [ - - ] bargain hunter cruiseship inspired reviews come for the beach , the booze , the staff and sit back and enjoy 
had a great time but somethings could of been better my husband and i just got back from our vacation at excellence punta cana we had a great time the weather was perfect and the room were very nice they had a good entertainment show every night we enjoyed the pool very much they have two different pools and both were very big the beach was beautiful the food was ok not great and we 've been to many resorts in dr our favorite restaurant was the asian the waiter ( victor ) at that restaurant was on point and extremely nice it was delicious the lobster house not good at all the drinks were good not great but they did have a mojito that was reallllyyy goood we had a really nice time and would probably do it again the mosquitos do not play there we took repelent from ny woods repelent and we still got stung so beware of those mosquitos 
not quite 5 star , but great value just came back from our 5 days at the excellence resort punta cana over all very nice trip , but lets take you there airport in punta cana , you are greeted by having your picture taken , then give $10 for a temp visa , which you then walk 100 ft , and hand to another person , quite odd the trip to the hotel is well over an hour , not 30 min and the streets are full of potholes , and the scenery is dismal ( bodegas , shandy houses ) hotel grounds are very nice , some construction going on , but quite nice orlando at the front desk was very helpful in accomodating us with a nice pool view room , our first room had minor issue , no iron or board , some lights not working , tv remote not working and the view was of just a bunch of trees in the back of other units the service and staff were the most friendly  helpful that i had ever experienced i was quite surprised to see that all of the bars had top shelf liquor ( sapphire , chivas , j black , etc ) bartenders very attentive and friendly ( coco loco drink ) the staff got you to loosen up and get involved in everything from drinking games , karioke , volleyball , etc , but more important they remembered your name , gave a shout out to you everyday , introduced you to others in particular rey was great , he and francisco , isabelle and marine really stand out the restaurants were all very good , better than any other all inclusive nice atmosphere and service ( spice  chez were my favorite , barcelona lacked atmosphere ( no music , too quiet ) the weather in punta cana is odd , sun fro 7:00 - 11:00, then mostly cloudy , and showers daily the beach was nice , the waves were bordering dangerous the shows at night were quite amateurish , and the dance club , we went every night , but was really nothing special the rooms wer spacious and clean , but the tile work and mini repairs were shabby housekeeping did not get to our room till almost 5:00 daily , no wash cloths , only 2 bath towels , just seemed a little skimpy over all the resort was beautiful , great pools , food , drink , and for the price it ca not be beat , but if your looking for a 5 star resort , i think the attention to details is lacking i do not think there is really anything they can do to upgrade it , but for the price it ca not be beat and again they service was the best 
a wonderful honeymoon at excellence my wife and i stayed at excellence for our honeymoon aug 25 ? the resort certainly met our expectations for a fantastic honeymoon but there were some minor things that kept me from giving it a 5- rating this was our 3rd trip to an all - inclusive caribbean resort in the past 14 months and 2nd to the d my comparisons were based on those experiences versus our recent trip the other resort we stayed at last year was melia caribe tropical in bavaro , d first of all , none of the following factored into the rating but travelers deciding to come here should know them ahead of time the bus ride stinks if you have to pick up a lot of people it?? quick if it?? just the two of you that?? what you get in a resort setting and you pick a resort at the far end of the line have the driver stop and get some presidente and it will be ok or if a 1-2 hour bus ride is going to ruin your entire trip , pick something in bavaro there are some mosquitoes and i get bit more than anyone i know we sucked it up because we were having a great time outside , having dinner , listening to music , sitting on the porch use bug spray if it really bothers you the water is rough because it?? so far north ( on the atlantic ocean ) instead of the calm waters on the other side of the eastern tip this part was kind of disappointing , because we loved taking the hobie cats out on our last trip however , we had fun in the waves because it reminded us of home they have boogie boards that you can use if you need to scratch that aquatic itch the layout and roomthe resort itself has a beautiful layout and is small enough to comfortably walk from one end to the other without tiring out all restaurants are centrally located and easy to find , except of course for our confusion between the mexican and mediterranean restaurants switching back and forth every night our room was spectacular , we got the top floor of building 8 so there were high ceilings , we looked over the pool and could see the ocean just a short distance away the four post bed was comfortable but nothing special our room was always kept up after we got back from the pool/beach , the bar completely re - stocked with rum , beefeater gin and jim beam if you want a cold beer , fill up the ice container and put in two presidentes an hour or two before you want them there was even bud and bud light for the non - adventurous , red bull , gatorade and some juices to mix it doesn?? get that cold in the mini - fridge though our room had a jetted tub that was only behind a half - wall which made for a relaxing and romantic bath the shower was just a small stand - up , just barely big enough for an average male and petite female it probably could have been bigger one side note , we got the excellence club package i came on trip advisor and saw a lot of people bashing it and thought i had been taken the private check in is great , you can go to them to arrange your reservations for horseback , spa , romantic dinner , etc if you want more rum , more gatorade , more mints on your pillow , it?? a phone call away they had food out from 7 am until 11pm it was buffet food , but there was never anyone up there , so if you wanted a quick snack ( or the largest selection of booze ) you could stop in and watch the flat screen while you ate they had internet access , which was slow but what do you expect it?? good for travelers who have some business they want to check on but don?? want to pay for it i thought it was definitely worth it if you get the ec package and after your private check - in expect $500 worth of amenities to smack you in the face , then don?? get it pool/beachboth the main pool and cascade pool were amazing the main pool is home to the swim - up bar , and is usually some good fun in the later afternoons after a few too many mamajuana it wound through half the resort , big enough that i actually never saw them doing the daily activities in the pool the cascade pool is more serene , at least it was the day we spent there not too many lounging options around the edge , where it was easy to find some at the main pool the beach was pretty typical for a caribbean resort , but we didn?? have any problems finding chairs towels are out in the mornings , but i would suggest asking for beach towels to be delivered to your room so you don?? have to worry about it foodi have to say that out of the three resorts we??e been to in the past year , this one was probably the most disappointing the best meal i had all week was at the pan - asian restaurant the lobster house was good i thought , and chez isabelle left a little to be desired i got my favorite cut of meat at the steakhouse ( ribeye ) and it was overcooked because it was so thin i thought that the buffets had a limited selection , but what was there was delicious the smoothie bar was a very nice addition there were a lot of choices and we only doubled up because we didn?? know what was going to be closed ahead of time activitieswe didn?? partake in a lot of the instructor led events , but did do a few things that made the trip we got the couples romance massage at the spa , which was extremely relaxing and definitely needed we used the free horseback riding excursion , and it was actually pretty fun , and we did get our $15 bottle of rum as a nice keepsake we took the day - trip to saona , which was another long bus trip but it was just a chance to catch up on my sleep the boat trip/island stay/catamaran return was amazing , with a stop at the natural pool to find starfish (200 yards off - shore in waist deep water ) we also checked out the free cooking lesson on the beach almost every day , and the food was really good , especially the barbecue day the shows were interesting , michael jackson was entertaining but we were disappointed he didn?? actually sing chris blizzard was probably the best act , and the magician could have been skipped we went to the casino a couple of nights and i never felt like anything shady was going on but i was usually paying attention bring pj?? , they have a pajama party at the disco one night that we didn?? come prepared for we didn?? spend a lot of time at the sports bar but i did watch my alma mater play their season opener there i really had a good time overall the extras put this resort ahead of the other two , hands down i think my wife would say the same we recommend taking advantage of all that you can while you are there we would return , but will probably try another resort for our next vacation since we like new things 
terrible customer service the resort was beautiful , the food was good , but we had a big problem when we checked out , the clerk and bell boy was instructed to get our luggage from our room , but instead , picked someone elses up , thinking it was ours well , they made us believe that it must have went to the airport without us they finally figured out that it was still in the room , after we had left i should have went back to the room to check for myself , but they totally made us believe that it was put out front now our stuff is still sitting at this resort , and we have to pay for thier mistake , which is $480 00 to have it shipped from d they refused , and said that it was our fault , that we told them , that another set of luggage , that was in the hall , ( not the room , like i told them ) was ours i would never tell someone that some luggage was mine , if it were not they were not willing to take any responsiblity for any of the disaster even to come to an agreement to pay for half of the shipping costs they 're employee 's we 're responsible , and in my business , and any other good business , if your employee makes a mistake , then the company should make it right beware , if you go here they have really done us wrong we will never go back , nor refer anyone to go here 
great honeymoon this hotel was very nice we stayed here on our honeymoon in may of 2004 for 6 nights , when we checked in they gave us the wrong room type , we didnt even know b/c the room was gorgeous ( we were supposed to have a private pool ) the room we were in had a romantic feel , open jacuzzi tub , pretty vanity/bathroom area , beautiful bed we were on the ground floor and our terrace opened right to the pool - - literally four steps to the pool which was amazing , clean and pretty we had our own hammock outside , and we could just get out of bed , and swim up to the pool bar all inclusive is the way to go for punta cana , and this resort is away fromthe hustle and bustle of the city the food was okay , but we are really picky when it comes to food , some may say it was great if they arent into going out to nice resturants either way we had a blast , great honeymoon - - - and we have the excellence club package so we had access to the private little club room upstairs for coffee and snacks all day long , really nice touch 
a very relaxing resort stayed at the excellence from the 4th of august until the 14th overall a very nice and relaxing resort the staff really are amazing and will go out of their way to help you out being that my wife and i usually stay at 5 star resorts , we were not too impressed with the food though the filet mignon at the grill was awesome if your looking for a party place this is not the resort for you if your looking for a beautiful relaxing holiday , with no spring breakers to jump cannon balls in your face all day this place is perfect i like to jump the odd cannon ball here and there so this was a small letdown : - ) while here , we shopped a little at the huts on the beach look for  daniel boon he has some great deals tell him mike from canada sent you and he will know that you ca not be ripped off daniel asked me to send him some leather flip flops so if anyone is going i am sure he would so appreciate this ( size 10) he is a very hard working nice young man overall a great place to travel though 10 days of relaxation started to wear me out i prefer the option of partying off the resort once in a while so mexico it will be next time christina and rob for nj - enjoyed our time with both of you send pics soon and rob - watch out for that brugal eh 
what a wonderful honeymoon my husband and i were married in april and had to wait four months to go on our honeymoon so we were pretty excited and ready to go i have to say that the resort is absolutely beautiful i have read a lot of these reviews and looked at many pictures but it still took my breath away we did not have to wait for check in and the staff were very friendly we paid for the excellence club and i have read that a few people thought it was a rip off not in my opinion because we never had to wait in line for a concierge someone was always available and the air conditioned room we could go to was welcomed when we wanted to get out of our room and and out of the heat there were a few issues we had bugs in our room realizing we were in the tropics i was not too bothered until the second night after they had sprayed and it was still a problem they upgraded our room for free and it was not even an issue the staff were very accomodating our travel agent did not book us the right package and we had been looking forward to the beach dinner but unfortunately was not booked for us we explained to the concierge the problem and without even questioning we were able to have the beautiful , delicious dinner by the ocean i ca not say enough for the staff the shows at night were entertaining a little cheesy but you could tell how hard they worked we never had to wait for drinks you must try the banana mama and the pina coladas were fantastic the horseback riding was fun but could 've done without due to the horses all bunched together and it was really hot the shops on the edge of the beach are ridiculous do not pay what they ask they wanted $80 for a picture frame that cost 20 in the store on the resort if you do not want to barter and do not want to be hassled just keep walking if you venture out they are pushy we tipped every so often , it is not expected but you kinda feel you should just cause the service is so good the food was wonderful we ate everywhere except the grill for dinner but i had beef elsewhere and loved everything i loved my honeymoon and even though a day was rainy due to the hurricane i could not have asked for anything better i would love to go and experience it all over again ( there are plenty of photos on here i am not adding any ) 
scammed at the excellence we were scammed at the excellence resorts in punta cana at their casino the first night of our 6th year anniversary vacation , we were given 2 $5 chips as we entered the casino to initially play some blackjack these chips were only to be used for super keno so we figured , hey , why not this was the beginning of our nightmare and the worst vacation of our entire life we made it up to 98 points that first night tim from arkansas smooth talked us , just like bill clinton i am a teacher and he told me how his sister is a teacher , too he told us nobody ever makes it to 98 points like this ( little did we know that his was a lie the same stories are told by others who got scammed on superkenoscam our jackpot was $52,000 anyhow , our game got closed that first night because our bank card was apparently not swiping jack led me into the casino office to call my bank and shut the game down for approximately 1 hour although i was on the phone with my bank and they told me i had sufficient funds for a cash advance , the casino claimed the card would not swipe but , because the casino was so nice , they would hold the game for us another night so , the next night we went back to the casino the same issue was occurring i pulled out one ball oh , and what do you know it was a double oh great $100,000 jackpot , but or bet doubled as well but then my card was not swiping ( so they claimed ) tim even told us how he told his mother about us , the nice couple from ct about to win a big jackpot again , i was led into the casino?? office same issue , my bank told me the funds are there , but the casino?? visane t machine kept stating , call bank they told us to go to the bank o popular tomorrow and they would comp the taxi ride and they?? hold the game yet another night so , on the third day of our vacation we take a taxi to the bank and take out a little less than $10,000 thinking if we hit a double again we would be able to cover the bet i mean we only had to hit that 2 point ball if we hit 98 points in one night , why couldn?? we hit one of the many point balls well , we now know it was all a scam well , we go back the third night with cash in hand of course , we hit another double now we??e up $200,000 tim was telling us how he never had a jackpot so large so we bet again we hit a $10 00, and then a $5 we hit another double now our jackpot was up to just under $500,000 we were forced to walk away because yet again our bank card was stating call bank when the swiped it however , i was on the phone with people?? bank and they told me that their computers were not showing that the casino was swiping it this happened for approximately 1 hour we were forced to walk away after we had invested our savings , approximately $20,000 i am so embarrassed to say it my husband and i do not gamble we just figured if we got 98 points that quickly we were sure to get the 2 points needed to win the jack pot we have been saving to build our dream home and actually have not been on a vacation since our honeymoon 6 years ago we now realize this entire game was a scam from day one this is the scam tim would cover one of the numbers on the ball as he retrieved it he?? read off the number , while jack was distracting us we did not even see the number on the ball the numbers aren?? printed large on the balls , like bingo we trusted the american dealers they manipulated the game by losing your bet on repeat numbers or when they wanted to keep you invested they?? let you win a little amount of money there is a scam with double balls there is scam with them turning off the machine and allowing all the balls to drop there is a scam with them splitting up the husband and wife to call the bank hopefully a video may prove their guilt on the covering up the numbers on the ball when they take it out we complained to the excellence hotel management , who we think is in on this scam , and told them about what happened they ( rafael and jose maria ) kicked us out of their office they told us that they needed evidence they told us they have video surveillance of us signing for the money we tried to explain that is not the point so we printed out some of the stories that were written on the superkenoscam website regarding the scam at their hotel , even one that was recently posted on monday , july 23rd , 2007 they did not even want to see it or talk about this matter further we have never been so cruelly treated by a hotel they are not supporting us , nor would advise us what to do they claim the casino is not part of the hotel , yet excellence employees gave us the chips and told us to play the super keno game we can?? even get a straight answer out of anybody we were even having difficulty finding out the names and numbers of the managers we spoke with the us embassy and i wrote a letter to the secretary of finance/office of casinos in the dominican republic however , when i asked the concierge to translate the letter , her boss said she couldn?? because something would get lost in translation so , i did my best at translating the letter myself we also wrote 3 letters/e - mails to the excellence hotel managers and general managers of course , there has been no response the excellence hotel will not even warn its guests about the super keno scam being run inside their hotel 
domingo made it special excellent accomodations wonderful entertainment highlighted by the saxophone playing of domingo made out six day excursion well worth the trip the only drawback was the time of the year - - mid july is not the opportune time to visit punta cana if you have difficulty with heat and humidity most days were excessively uncomfortable - - let 's just say darn hot when a guest feels as though he is suffering a coronary due to an inability to breathe because the air is so heavy - - that poses a problem back to domingo the man is an incredible entertainer who makes a stranger feel like a life long friend i still hear domingo 's magic performed on his alto and tenor sax domingo was the highlight of our trip 
set your expectations overall our experience at excellence was wonderful there were a few dissappointments i wo not belabor the negatives but will highlight them upon checking in , the front desk employee tried to sell us an upgrade we declined and decided to stay with our original reservation the first night there we learned our buildings elevator was not working and the ice machine was non - existant the next day we mentioned that to the same person at the front desk who checked us in the prior day she offered to move us to another building or deliver ice a free upgrade for the inconvenience was out of the question we decided to stay with our original room , which was a beautiful room , rather than disrupt our stay by moving and repacking the food was tasty but not as described in the menus the presentation was always different than described we decided to enjoy the positive , the service was very good , the food was tasty and we were on vacation our motto was not what i expected but very good anyway the pool and beach were immaculate and the massage staff were very professional i would love to see guests leave the pool floats in the pool rather than keep them all day by their chairs there are plenty for everyone to use while they are in the pool the entire resort was very clean even though the hotel is beginning to show it 's age i would definitely recommend excellence and would like to stay longer next time 
be warned flew with thompson , upgraded to premium , best premium in the world , worth every penny of ?150fantastic resort , clean pool , room , beach , facilities took helicopter too resort worth every penny ( did seem strange no one to meet us ) as we booked with hotel , got to reception everyone ultra friendly , got talked into upgrade $100 per night for 1 bowl fruit that rotted and 1 bowl flowers that wilted free internet and an annoying concierge that rang every time you were about to siesta , it?? a rip off , most of the other rooms are the same the room was kept immaculate , flowers on towels etc drink , all you can and top premium brands , 5 star wine with meals ok but a bit slow breakfast ok , buffet , lack of fruits got board after 4 days , 4 star lunch ok , buffet was best , lack of salads 3 5 stardinner poor , french poor , italian poor , mediterranean poor , mexican ok , lobster ( stank ) did not try spice did not fancy in all took , 1 hour between courses , this is the only reason that stops me ringing thompson and booking for next year the quality of the food overall rating 4 stars , if you have booked , enjoy , you will be made welcome , the location and the resort is good , but the dinner is poor 
close to excellent after months of reading about dr and excellence pc , we finally made the trip june 10 to 15ththe resort is as dramatic as as anything i 've seen throughout the carib the beach is clean and very pleasant the property is very nice , we had room 14006, a ground floor , ocean view suite at the end of the property this worked out great for my wife and i so great in fact , that i elected to stay in this room instead of taking the excellence club room that i had reserved and paid for - lol only down side of this trip was getting to dr usair has such a small operation at dfw airport , that asset management is weak at best long story short - if it were up to usair , i 'd still be in the rebook line at the airport an unplanned aspect of the trip was flying into santo domingo opposed to delaying 24 hours to fly from dfw to puj i elected to fly into santo domingo to save a day of our trip the cab ride from santo domingo to pc was about 3 5 hours and a couple of fender benders - but never the less an experience consider going to the don lucas cigar company - a small cigar rolling operation this is not a structured excursion , but ask johnathon at the excursion desk to arrange a private visit all considerations - the trip was great and if i need another downtime excursion , excellence pc will be considered last , but not least , i have tons of photos , but none are unique to all of the the other great photos already posted - 
loved the staff i visited your resort with girlfriends to celebrate my 50th birthday and was impressed with the staff franklin and francesco were fun and hard working mario , your bartender was fabuluous he is without a doubt , one of the hardest working guys i 've ever seen he works continually and still manages to remember everyone 's name and their beverage of choice ( wished i had his memory his work ethic is impeccable thanks for a great birthday 
great resort this resort was great the food , the climate  the employees were great the beach was one of the best we 've seen in a long time it was a beautiful  relaxing place to vacation the employees @ this resort were all friendly and courteous ,  made our stay very enjoyable there were some that went above  beyond their duties  i want to let the resort know who these employees are , so i will go to the resort website we would definetly return to this resort 
we had a great time at excellence punta cana arriving - airport is quaint but easily disorganized if more than one flight arrives at a time we suggest you arrange your own ride to the hotel as the drive is long enough without having to stop at other hotels along the way - excellence would certainly be last on the list since it is one of the furthest away we were greeted at the hotel with a cool cloth to refresh us but there was no glass of champagne waiting for us as we had read in many of the reviews here perhaps because a bus full of people had just arrived room - spacious and comfortable though it had a musty smell when we arrived we anticipated the possible smell from some of the reviews we read so we brought a fragrant kitchen candle from williams sonoma which did the trick others we spoke with did not have the same musty smell in their rooms the shower was great , the king size bed was comfortable , the jacuzzi tub was nice to have in the room and our building ( #1) was centrally located we also had a small patio which we did not use property - lovely , large and spread out lengthwise along the beach so every room seems to be close to the sand and surf there were very nice gardens , wildlife i peacocks , pink flamingos , geese , ducks , parrots , chickens with their chics , turtles and of course , plenty of geckos around the lobby had a very tropical feel to it with a center area that was open to the sky with lush plantings at night there were lanterns which illuminated the walking paths the grounds were well maintained though the pesticide spraying ( typically done around 7pm while we were on the tennis court ) should be done overnight while the guests are asleep breathing this in was very unpleasant and one of the only complaints we have about this hotel there were three tennis courts , a basketball court , a very basic gym ( we used this several times ) with spa ( additional cost if you want a treatment ) , recreational area with pool table , ping pong , board games , etc there are two pools which are both beautiful the very long , winding pool was on the other side of the property from our room so we did not use it we typically used the beach but one day we did use the pool near our room it had a lovely waterfall from one level down to the next and was a nice place to hang out for a day there is a small casino which we enjoyed for one evening 's entertainment we were not interested in attending any of the shows that were provided in the evenings beach - one of the most beautiful beaches it really was gorgeous and not just a sliver of beach like many hotels have this was on it 's own cove which was perhaps 3/4 of a mile long the sand was soft and clean the water had just enough waves for body surfing ( boogie boards provided ) but was not really rough as some people have noted the snorkeling was okay , not great it was right off the beach which was a plus and the equipment is very accessible on the beach too we stayed down one end of the beach ( to the right as you 're facing the water ) to avoid the loudspeaker of the activities folks - we were mostly interested in relaxing , reading a book or magazine , soaking up the sun and drinking the various frozen drinks they offered us we loved the tiki umbrellas which helped us escape the sun when we got too hot there were daily bar - b - ques on the beach which were nice we played beach volleyball once ( some people took this waaaaay to seriously , it is vacation after all ) and also took a beach aerobics class which was fun splashing in the surf i did a four mile run on the beach one day which was very scenic and quite hot quite a difference from my usual runs back home in nyc restaurants/bars - there were seven restaurants and many bars ( approximately ten or so ) for dinner , the best restaurant here was chez isabelle we also enjoyed spice ( thai/japanese/chinese ) restaurant the grill , lobster house and barcelona were okay we did not like the mexican restaurant , agave we did not eat dinner at toscana though the breakfast and lunch there was terrific with so many options we particularly liked the smoothies we had every morning sometimes , we found that the descriptions on the dinner menus were not exactly what you got on your plate though we 're flexible and went with the flow the bars are located all around the property so you can always get a drink when you want one including top shelf liquor if you request it staff - the staff are generally friendly and do their best to accomodate you we particularly enjoyed two of the staff : antonia with her big , beautiful smile and charming service at toscana and kelvin ( the smaller kelvin ) , also with a nice smile and gracious service at chez isabelle as well as at toscana they really made us feel welcome and offered us their warm hospitality they were both muy excellente overall - we would recommend this hotel to friends and family we were happy to read one review from another gay couple prior to coming which made us feel confident that we would be comfortable here though we may have been the only gay couple here during our stay , we never felt uncomfortable and were treated well by all the staff overall , we had a wonderful , relaxing vacation and would come back again 
very good resort my wife and i stayed at the excellence ( club ) from apr 18th - 25th we are in our mid 40's and travel regularly overall , we recommend this resort and would consider staying here again beach  pools : the terrific beach ( there is surf ) and pools are the primary reasons to stay here rooms : the rooms are nicely furnished and in good condition the beds , pillows , and linens are of low quality and not very comfortable food  drink : our expectations were low we ate at all of the restaurants the food is generally ok , but certainly not 4-5 star the liquor is mid - range and the beer selection is limited service : the staff is friendly and helpful a bit of spanish is handy , especially if you have any unusual needs or requests otherwise , they generally understand english sufficiently grounds : the common buildings and grounds are attractive and well maintained tip : consider taking a taxi from the airport ( $60) and ask the driver to stop and get a presidente or two for the 1 hour trip 
great food , beach and weather resort was very well maintained great staff and service clean pool , nice beach food was excellent for a resort experience overall , a very nice week one pet peeve , and this is not specific to this resort , is the lack of courtesy displayed by fellow guests i 'm referring to those who come out at dawn to 'reserve ' a chair in the sun , a cabana in the shade , a chair on the beach , etc and then proceed to use each for less than an hour all day a lot more courtesy would be appreciated 
liked it , but did not love it i 'll start by saying that overall my husband and i enjoyed our time at excellence , but i 'm not certain that i would return to this resort the biggest reason i 've seen many write that the food here is good , but imho , it just was not - - and that was a big negative for me i will admit that i am a picky eater ( no seafood , please ) , but my husband is much easier to please , and he also found the quality lacking many dishes either were terribly oversalted or had no flavor at all marinated chicken breast marinated in what at the buffet breakfast , the sides were often cold ( despite the warming trays ) or just plain unappealling i found myself ordering the little pizza late at night for room service because the dinners were a disappointment not one meal was good enough for me to think , oh , we should try to come back to this restaurant once more not even the famed chez isabelle i found the chateaubriand was just passable and nothing special the pizza was also just fair , but when you 're hungry enough after several cocktails and a not - so - good dinner , it became much more enticing you get the idea in fairness , i did hear others say they enjoyed some of their meals , but i just ca not say that i did it was not awful , but i would never call it good other aspects of the resort were much better we loved the beach , which was huge , and really enjoyed playing in the rough waves , although some days that undertow was no joke we are both good swimmers and never let the red or black flags stop us from going in the water , but if you are not a confident swimmer , or do not pay attention to what you 're doing out there , i can see someone getting into trouble we found it fun , but be careful i do wish that they would hose off the little tables on the beach they were caked with sand , and would benefit from a hose down once in awhile service on the beach is nice - - we always tipped at least a buck or two per round and the servers were very good to us several servers knew our preferred drink orders after a day or two , and often just brought them to us without being asked we spent a few afternoons at the main pool , and really liked it ( not so much the cascade , where the crowd seemed older and the atmosphere a bit lacking ) at the main pool , the swim up bar is pretty large , and has a nice mix of sun and shade it 's also more social at the pool , so if you want to have some good conversations , check it out we met some really nice people and had a good time there the bartenders at cafe kafe where we spent many evenings were all very good benjamin , junior , and ricardo kept our glasses full at all times , and made a good drink the waitstaff that handled the theater was also very attentive and a few of the shows were pretty good ( we thought the michael jackson review and chris blizzard were best ) the rooms were okay , but there was definitely a strong musty smell with overtones of mold not so nice i called room service one night and nearly gagged at the smell coming from the handset a really nasty moldy smell emanated from it that made me hold the phone away from my head to make any future calls the bed was very hard , but oddly enough , we had no trouble sleeping maybe it had something to do with the sun and the drinks , but we did not mind it too much the rest of the room and bathroom was fine , but i would not say luxurious the armoire had drawers that just did not want to work , and the remote did not work with the tv in our room not a big deal , but not great either we did really enjoy our week at the resort , but both agree that we would return to an all - inclusive in playa del carmen in mexico before we returned here mexico just seems to have an edge over dr in terms of food , cleanliness , and the details , but i 'm sure in time the dr will get there do not worry , though if you are going to excellence , you will almost certainly have a good time even with my disappointment over the food , i am glad we went it was a fun , relaxing week on a gorgeous beach with unlimited drinks and really , is not that what counts most 
first and last time at excellence we stayed here from march 24th to the 28th , 2007 the excellence was good in many ways the location on the beach is fantastic the drive to and from the airport is a real treat the food at this resort was very good along with top shelf booze , most people will enjoy that part most all the restaurants were good if you remember when you arrive they will tell you a 30 minute wait ( hoping you 'll leave ) and once you do not leave to go to a different restaurant you 'll get seated within 5 minutes the only exception is the lobster house which served mushy whole body carribean lobster that i did not care for ( small ) the french restaurant was superb other than the exposed kitchen door with the black light bug zapper in plain sight near the door kinda killed the ambiance the room service was adequate especially if you liked turkey or club sandwiches the physicial property is very nice the pools were excellent and the beach was fantastic the water was a little rough so just play in the shallow big waves the waitress bring drinks to you at the pool or beach and will also get you nachos or other snacks a buck here or there made them remember you 're there they also had a beach cookout for the dominica theatre show and i fiqured i 'd give the lobster one more try i asked the cook who was cooking about 30 of them on an open grill ( they looked more than cooked almost burnt ) if i could have one and he told me come back in twenty minutes there was no one else around and you got your food from the grills i think they were in cohoots with the other restaurant servers lol that was disapointing i saw the dealer hit a guy with an 18, who seemed ineberated , who then busted in blackjack they 'll do anything for your chips you are warned the room , this was the biggest disapointment since we were on our anniversary trip the quality of the towels were terrible you hope for big fluffy towels they were more like what i 'd use to wash my car with , no washcloths the first two days , only two bath towels everyday , you could call for more the air conditioning struggeled to keep the room lower than about 74 and our last night i awoke at about 3 am sweating because the ac stopped working , i believe they have motion sensors in the rooms when they detect no motion , it shuts off the ac thanks , i do not want ac at night these building are about 15 years old and are showing signs of the wear , rusty screws all over in the shower holding up the grab bars , rusty toilet paper holders etc do not get room 3014 we payed good money for a five star resort and got , at best 2-3 star accomadations i even had a pillow case that was worn thru , in several places , to the actual pillow when you picked up the phone you got a terrible smell of musty breath residue it seems like secrets resort who sold this resort to build a new one had the right idea it seems like the key would be to find a resort built after the hurricane hit five years ago the bed was like sleeping on the floor , rock hard , i actually had sore ribs one day we 're not that picky , but cleanliness , comfort etc is very important to us when we pay these prices we have been to no less than 20, 4 and 5 star all - inclusive resorts and were disapointed with the excellence most of the people were nice with the exceptions we would probally not go back to this resort and prefer the top end mexician resorts overall much better do yourself a favor 
not so excellent just got back today my girlfriend and i wanted to see the carribean in january and were told that the dominican republic was beautiful at the time we could go , so we heard great things about excellence punta cana and decided to book six days there we arrived monday jan 8 and were welcomed with glasses of champagne and an amazingly landscaped resort our room was not ready yet , so we had lunch at the grill while we waited , and so began the service problems food takes incredibly long at the grill and if you are at the pool all day , or the beach , make sure you bring a shirt and girls , a shirt and skit , or shorts , otherwise they will not let you in the rooms was beautiful and had a very nice garden view air conditioning worked well and the bed was nice and big the bath water is real hot too the pools are beautiful and the beach is as well the ocean is extremely rough and the rip tide is fierce my girlfriend and i almost drowned , literally , while boogie boarding the current is strong , one minute you are in waist deep , the next second , you cant touch there are no lifeguards , so if you get carried out , you are s o l the food , hmm , let me tell you about the food i am a chef in a very fine restaurant , ( no names mentioned ) , and i was really disappointed room service has the the best food and the most punctual service first meal was at barcelona a mediterranean restaurant and the food was great once it got to the table it took forever to get our food next meal was at toscana ( italian ) and that was decent the cheese is god awful though , anything containing cheese , except the pizza , is terrible next meal was at agave ( mexican ) which was completly awful avoid at all costs , not only does it suck , but the next morning , we felt awful the best dinner was at chez izzabelle ( french brasserie ) the only steak i had that was actually cooked how i asked chateubriand is a reccomended choice here do not eat the chicken anywhere in the resort , it 's terribly dry and doesnt taste right the last two nights , we had room service cuz we just could not stand it breakfast buffet is ok , but the eggs are lethal and made me very ill the service overall is sub par the bartenders take extremely long just to make one drink and if you watch them , they 'll douse your drinks with alcohol rendering them undrinkable , if not watched , there is no alcohol in your drink at all , just fruit juices sometimes you may be completely ignored waiting gor a drink until you give up and leave everyone here is tip hungry they dont want to do anything unless you tip them even though you have already paid for all gratutities in you inclusive package i tipped when i felt it right , but they think you are just going to run the halls tossing out bills and expect you to the first day we left our maid money and came back to a turned down bed and towel sculptures the next day we didnt leave a tip and we came back to a room with no towels , no towel sculptures , bed just tucked up and made and nothing special the rest of the trip was like that , cuz we refused to tip just to get the service we paid for every tour you go on , they stick their hands out for tips , always wanting more it really pissed me off we did the atv tour right on the resort and it was a lot of fun dont take the dune buggy , it broke down on us and they had to call for another quad for us it was fun and you got to see the countryside and towns , cave , schools , local streams , a very pleasant trip an amazing tour out to the carribean side to a small island white sand beaches , water as clear as anything , and beautiful calm the weather was beautiful and the island is hotter than the resort area on the way back you stop at a sand bar to see starfish the carribean festival is a sham dont do it , waste of a day and your money it supposed to be a snorkeling tour , you snorkel for 40 minutes and then screw around on a stupid boat overall , we had an ok time , some good , some bad things were way better in mexico at the spa palace i was not happy in the dr and will not be returning 
so call me an all - inclusive snob i 've been to a few of them and this has got to be the worst resort ever i went through the hotel to book a helicopter transfer from the airport to the hotel spoke with concierge on several occassions about this and we waited for it and it never showed because the hotel never actually booked it there was always a wait for dinner not just 5 minutes but more like 1 hour yes , we went at a high volume time but they close one restaurant every night there 's no pattern to which restaurant is closed , either there was always something *missing* from the menu every single day , we would ask for something on the menu , and they just say - no , we do not have it order something else - exploding ketchup bottles yes , one popped like opening a champagne bottle and exploded on me and about a 3 feet radius around me instead of being sympathetic , the staff looked at me like i did something wrong they were more concerned about the mess it made around me then when it happened to someone else sitting next to me - they just took all the ketchup bottles away smart move but maybe some suggestions on getting my nice clothes dry - cleaned would have been more helpful i went to concierge and told them about it they took my clothes and cleaned it but they charged me the full price plus an additional 50% for express service i understand tropical bushy areas get creatures i 've never seen the rats in ny but i saw the biggest rat ever in the mexican restaurant flying through the dining area it was going so fast , it slid and went under the cabinet in the far corner when i told the server about it - he was not surprised and just asked if i wanted to finish my dinner again - a little more sympathy would have been nice but his nonchalant behaviour led me to believe this was not a rare occassion when i told the bartender about it outside , he just chuckled and said he saw 3 earlier that day and asked me what i thought the pork chops are made out of yeah , very nice i 'm not so sure he was joking with me 
gave us a great honeymoon my wife and i stayed here for our honeymoon over thanksgiving week and had a great time although the trip was not perfect , our positives far outweighed the negatives i 'll give you the pro 's , con 's and suggestions if you are going to be traveling there soon weather was great although it rains almost everyday ( due to their location on the leeward side of the mountains ) , the rains are brief and refreshing my wife and i played in the pool and ocean during the rains , or we would nap under the huts , which were 99% waterproof the service was very friendly many of the workers speak little english , but they tried their hardest to please you at all times every morning , i was served drinks in the pool and on the beach without request or tipping every request was met with a smile the nightly shows were pretty good having travelled to many places in the caribbean , including mexico , we thought these shows were the best we saw all but one show and i can tell you most of them were excellent the michael jackson show was very entertaining , as well as the circus ( more of a strongman show ) skip the magic show ( good if it was a kids resort ) , but definitely attend perfect couple night you could win a free vacation and there are definite laughs to be had on this night the native show was also cool breakfast and dinner were very good like most all inclusives , your breakfast and lunch are buffet ( you can order 24 hour room service or have a meal served to you at lunch if you eat outdoors ) breakfast offers great omelettes and other egg items , as well as fresh native fruits ( pineapple , mango , watermelon , banana , plantains ) my wife loved their oatmeal , and the pastries were pretty good as well at lunch , the hot sandwiches and fresh pastas were good , but i never ate any of the deli meats and cheeses they had many different individual pizzas as well , some were good , some were not the cheese they used was very sharp like chedday or a heavy mozzerella dinners were very good except for at the seafood place ( oceana was the name ) my wife and i live in chicago and eat out quite a bit , and she is very particular about her food we were never disappointed the chinese restaraunt has most of the staple foods ( eggs rolls , sweet and sour chicken ) and some other items that were very good as well the sushi on the first night was good , but the second time we ate there it was just okay the steak place that sits in the center of the pool had fantastic meat cuts and veggies , but the appetizers and salad were okay we did not eat at the french restaraunt because we dont like french food and it was the only restaraunt that had a wait (10-15 minutes ) also , the dress code was only enforced if you were still wearing your bathing suit i went to dinner with shorts and a polo almost every night and never had a problem the mexican restaraunt is by far the best of all the places the every part of the meal was gorgeously prepared and tasted great many people we spoke to did not like the food , but their reasons were very bizarre ( an older man was very angry that his alfredo sauce was missing parsley , and another couple said they drank all day every day so the only food they could eat was noodles with butter ) the outback safari excursion although there were several companies that hosted this excursion , this company was clearly the best all of the tour guides were hilarious and informative you get to learn alot about the island , see most of that area ( including a trip into the mountains ) , drink quesquextal beer ( better than presidente ) , eat the flag , and go boogie boarding it is an adventure i will never forget if you are in the market for great rum , mamahuana , or cigars , this is the place to go however , do not buy anything from anyone in the hotel walk onto the beach and go left keep walking until you see the local 8 shops , which are right by the horses there are 8 shops full of local stuff there , but you only want to go to nancy in shop number 6 she does not haggle or pester you , and her prices were the best if you buy from anyone else , do not pay anything more than 1/3 of the price they start at the shopping here is very high pressure , but they will come down very quickly , especially if you play good cop bad cop with them ( let your wife be the bad cop , it is funny remember go to nancy in shop #6 towards the end , she is amazing there were wild animals everywhere that made for comical times flamingos , rabbits , peacocks , turkeys , parrots , you name it alright , time for the negatives :1 bugs - it is buggy , but when you are in a hot and humid environment , what do you expect bring some mosquito wipes and dont eat at an outdoor restaraunt after it rains and you should be fine the shopping - everyone is very high pressure , especially on market nights ( sun , tues , and thur ) just go to nancy in shop 6 and she has everything you want for cheap the fishing excursion even if you are experienced , the waves are an average 8-10 feet everyone on our boat got sick and we had to turn around halfway through speaking spanish everywhere brush up on basic phrases otherwise your ability to communicate with the hotel employees will be severely limited the entertainment during the day there is little to nothing planned for you to do during the day , so if you bore easily , bring a book or something else to do especially if the weather is bad , there will be nothing for you to do during the day except check out board games the spa - the prices are comparable to the states and the services arent nearly as good also , my wife and i received totally unexpected naked rubdowns in a cell - like room it was very uncomfortable , but made for a great story suggestions for future travelers :1 bring bug wipes for the evenings see all the shows but the magic show ( circus is also optional )3 bring something to do for a rainy day bring any medical supplies you might need ( feminine products , headaches , stomachaches , etc ) they are expensive here visit nancy in shop #66 above all , just relax , your on vacation so many people were so uptight about the stupidest things when any problem you had could be instantly fixed by ordering another meal or getting another drink 
wished they had kept it secret travelled in january hated this hotel service levels were so poor almost impossible to get a tea bag ( despite a personal request to hotel manager ) it appeared that they used up everything over xmas queues for restaurants were unacceptable and food was terrible when you finally did get served in the seafood restaurant my husband was served raw mussels food was generally poor hotel trips required you to sign a disclaimer relinquising any right to claim even if you were injured as a result of their negligence we have stayed in 5 star hotels everywhere take my advice try one of the iberostar hotels 
way over priced i must first admit that the resort was beautiful but , the entertainment was lousy , the food was okay , the waiters in one restaurant were rude and there were very few activities after dinner the staff ate all the food at the afternoon luncheon ( hot dogs  burgers - nothing else ) on the beach and the guests were left with nothing , the evening dinner on the beach was quaint , but very unorganized i had some personal items stolen , ( i know it 's my own fault ) they advertised bed turn down and chocolates on our pillows , we had it one night they did not refill our coffee and water in the refrigerator , we did not always have clean towels i did not think this place was a bargain at any price 
great time at secrets just returned october 19, 2006 from a great time at secrets excellence in punta cana we were a group of 4 couples celebrating 40th anniversary would highly recommend the excellence club , we were met at the front desk and taken to the club room for a private check - in esperenza brought us a bottle of champagne and as we enjoyed our drink she took care of getting our rooms and all 4 rooms were close to each other ( all ocean view jr suites ) within a few minutes we had our room keys and she gave us the option of going upstairs to have some more drinks ( all top shelf ) and snacks ( fruits , cheeses , hot hor d ourves etc ) she told to relax and just let her know when we were ready to go to our rooms , we were escorted to our rooms by someone from excellence club rooms were very nice , toward end of stay did notice some very tiny ants , but this a tropical island and it had just rained , bring bug spray , sunscreen , and antifog if you wear eyeglasses , humidity is high the ride from the airport is long , but it gives an idea of what the island is like very poor since the hotel is no longer going to be a secrets property in january , we did notice that some things needed repair the pool is great , beach beautiful , ocean rough entertainment ok , but we were not broadway food good , not great many people complain that there are no top shelf liquors we had no problem if you ask , and pool drinks are not real stropn , but if you asked the bartender added more liquor , ( we all like the sammy sosa 's ) but the drink of the day was good every day of our stay we are looking forward to trying the new secrets in punta cana , which is closer to the airport 
what a great place why 's it 's taken this long to write a review , i 'll never know secrets in a word was heaven outstanding staff , food , beach , grounds , rooms the pool does get a bit crowded on windy days , just bring an ipod to drown out the loud talkers sitting next to you the highlight of the trip was the helicopter transfer from the airport to the resort , well worth the extra $$$ we thought about going back this year but like to try differant places so hey mon , jamaica here we come 
not a chance we 'd go back as honeymooners my husband as i stayed at secrets from june 25- july 2 we stayed in an ocean view room near the cascade pool - the smaller pool the weather was so hot and humid almost unbearable to lay out in the sun without getting sweat drenched , we should have known booking something in july i am not one to lay out in the sun or lounge all day i need action and activities we did participate in some of the daily entertainment but i got tired of volunteering and participating so we took the outback safari excursion one day , it was a time filler i would have liked to be able to shop or tour around but this was not the place if you are looking for no shopping , complete seclusion , then this is the place for you the food was okay i did not starve by any means my husband and i did not care for the mexican restaurant , our hometown place was much better we ate at the french restaurant twice , not that impressed , the food was saltly and just okay we enjoyed the japanese restaurant and ate there three times , the sushi bar was great we also enjoyed the seafood place and ate their twice we did not go to the italian place or the dominican place , just did not appeal to us my husband and i both got sick for a few days during the trip we did not drink the water so we are not sure what caused it all in all the place was very nice , we enjoyed the evening entertainment , the staff was very nice , but i would not go back 
what a rip off my self and my husband just returned from our honeymoon this evening and could not wait to let everyone know what a terrible place secrets excellence was when we first arrived we noticed there were cockroaches surrounding our minibar so called our rep at the excellence club and they were going to send someone to spray , next night there are still cockroaches in our room , third night we have had it because 1 was sitting on my husband 's toothbrush we called and they were sending someone up immediately - 45 minutes later he has to go tell people off just to have anyone pay attention to our problem we then switched our room and ended up in a room with double beds ( how i love lucy ) we were also sick for the majority of our trip going to the bano every few minutes to make matters worse the toliet did not flush - more waiting on people to fix it what a waste of over 5 thousand dollars the vip excellence club is crap because the food they serve you has been sitting out all day and god knows waht has been crawling on it the only good thing about secrets was we met really nice people 
good , but not great dont expect a lot so me and my family stayed at the bavaro from the 20th to the 28th of december ( just got back ) there were six of us in total , all above 18, so you know where this review is coming from i??l start out easy , this resort is good , it?? not great or excellent , it?? just good if you 're expecting the most amazing vacation ever , this probably isn?? your resort i?? going to break it down for you the hotel/grounds : the people here are very nice , i never once met a staff member who was angry or had mal - contempt for any of the travelers the grounds are very well kept people are always walking around trimming hedges , picking flowers , cutting grass etc the grounds are also very pretty the walkway from the lobby to the beach is very very pretty , the hedges with the flowers are amazing the rooms are big , much bigger than the rooms i had in both mexico and cuba they are well decorated and have decent amenities the bar fridge was always full and we never had a problem with the cleaning staff at all if you 're a diamond star member you can get bath robes and slippers for no cost if you ask the front desk the bathrooms were always clean , however the bath 's do not have a shower curtain or anything covering them , so if you??e having a shower , only one person can use the bathroom , annoying for anyone not travelling with a spouse one major issue i had with the room is that the ac was pretty awful , even with it turned on full with the temp as low as possible it barely felt like the ac was on , my brother?? room on the other hand was always cold , so it could have just been our room another annoying feature is the roads that run between every building , if you??e a light sleeper like i am , you will be woken up b the loud annoying trucks and trains that run by every couple minutes having said that this hotel is very very very clean the beach was clean , the rooms were clean , the lobby was clean etc overall i give the hotel/grounds a 4 the disco/entertainment : i??l start off with saying this , the disco has the worst hours i??e ever seen , whoever decided that the disco should open at midnight instead of say 10:30 or 11:00 was very very stupid if you 're like me and like getting up at 8:00 to actually enjoy your week or 2 of vacation then by the time 12:00 rolls around your going to be bagged because of this i found myself partying almost not at all both mexico and cuba had much better planned night life than dominican however , having said this , when the disco is open its usually pretty packed with decent music , the bartenders suck though , for an all inclusive resort they sure act like they try to curb drinking too much , one time i had to specifically wait for about 15 minutes because one of the bartenders would not get me 10 shots of tequila for my group of friends now for the shows , and i??l preface this by saying that they suck , most people will say how the michael jackson show is the best , but it isn?? not unless you like watching a bunch of guys lip - synch and dance around on stage all the shows except the circus one sucked , i was literally sitting in my chair with my hands in my lap because they were so bad if you want to relax , go to your room and watch t for an hour and actually be impressed , or hangout in the lobby and just talk now the circus act is pretty good and involves fire - breathers and a bunch f cool aerobics stuff , very circ - de - soliel bars : the bars were ok , most cocktails are mixed consistently , but the only bars that will serve the more exotic drinks like mojitos and banana daiquiri 's are the lobby bar and the theater bar i also found the alcohol to be very very very watered down i could drink 5-6 margaritas and not even feel anything , whereas if i made those drinks , i would be insanely hammered another stupid thing was bars running out of certain types of alcohol , like most of the bars ran out of tequila every day i would assume a resort with over 1000 rooms that they would have adequate drinks for all the bars food : pretty awful , most food is cold and tastes like it came from a 3 star resort the beach buffet serves the exact same food every day pizza , hot dogs , pasta and some chicken i seriously recommend eating every meal at the main buffet because they at least attempt to change the food every day ( even then it doesn?? change much ) most of the meat is tough and over - cooked and doesn?? taste very good , most food is pretty bland and i found myself walking around the buffet seeing only 1 or 2 things i wanted to eat mexico and even cuba had much much much better food the ala - cartes also suck , the waiters confuse the bills all the time and out of the 4 we went to , 3 of them missed meals and left at least one person in our party without a main course also most of the ala - cartes are glorified buffets basically it?? a buffet for the appetizers and the deserts and you get your choice of 5 main courses even then the food is pretty bad once again not even close to mexico or cuba also if you like seafood or are expecting lobster or crab at any of the restaurants , don?? bother going to this resort none of the restaurants have lobster or crab except the french restaurant which did a small portion of lobster as a main dish ( which was also band and cold ) the only saving grace for the restaurants was miko , the asian restaurant , the food there is prepared right in front of you , the decor is very nice and the food if i could i would just book all my dinners there the beach : the beach is very nice , it is very well kept and tidy , no seaweed of garbage is on the beach the water is nice , but rough don?? plan on snorkeling if you go , there isn?? anywhere to do it ( even though the site says it has snorkeling on site , you can?? ) the shipwreck is pretty cool , rent a catamaran or a kayak and go out there to see what it?? all about , its pretty good most of the days we went there was scattered showers so the beach had plenty of places to sit even past noon , but if there is a clear sunny day , you better get out there at 9 otherwise you??e going to be out of luck for a spot not much to really say about the beach , it?? clean and the sand is very fine and soft they do need another beach volleyball net because i played almost every day and there was always at least 5 teams playing at any one time one crappy thing about the beach is the people who constantly walk up and down the beach trying to sell you things the scuba caribe guys were so annoying , asking you to buy excursions every 10 minutes activities : has the normal stuff , they are pretty over - zealous with red - flagging the resort for high winds , 4 out of the 7 days i was there the boats weren?? allowed on the water which sucks once again , not much to say , they could use more boats for a resort this size but it?? nothing to complain about also , there is no snorkeling on site good resort for kite - boarding if you??e into it conclude this review by saying that the bavaro is a good resort , it?? not amazing , it didn?? have a special feel to it , i probably would not go back given the choice i imagine some of the other resorts are better the resort is big and long so be prepared to walk a decent amount the diamond club is pretty much useless , a private pool and private lunch/breakfast buffet is a lame incentive to buy into the club would i go back to the dominican back to the bavaro 
beautiful resort , however , lacking quite a few things we just returned from our stay at grand bahia principe punta cana we had a wonderful time , since the weather was absolutely perfect the hotel 's grounds are kept very well as well as the rooms , however , here are the cons to this resort : - the food is terrible we did not even have one good meal in any of the restaurants or buffet since most of our time was spent by the beach and pool area the only option for lunch was the snack bar the snack bar consisted of stale pizza , some salads , and leftover chicken i would not recommend eating in the snack bar you are better off taking the trolley back to the lobby and eating in the main buffet area or just skipping lunch totally we skipped quite a few meals gym was a joke i happen to exercise daily and i woke up the first morning to walk to a gym that was severally undersized for a resort of this size they had 2 treadmills and 1 was broken they had a total of approx 10 pieces of equipment there were 2 trainers present whom were using the equipment opposed to allowing the clients to use them they actually put there towels on the machines to show they were in use i decided to just exercise around the resort - the safety deposit box needs to be paid upfront in order to use it we went back to the lobby and paid the 18 dollars us we went back to our room and the safe still did not work , we had to have a technician visit our room 3 times in order to fix the broken safe that never wound up fixed - if you want a good seat by the pool make sure you are up at 6am in the morning to claim your territory these people are up real early with their towels and belongings already on the chairs way before breakfast i find this to be ridicolous they should put a policy in place that you can not claim your space before you even open the pool area japanese restaurant was a joke the chef did not say a word to us at the hibachi table he just cooked the food and threw it on our plate they need some training if they want to act like a japanese restaurant **dont bother eating here** or going out of your way to make reservations in any of their specialty restaurants they are all the same most of them are also buffets - all the liquor in the resort is well liquor the kind that gives you a headache in about a minute i did not drink more than 1 drink the entire week pros : - very pretty grounds and kept very clean service is very frequent to take you around the resort excursions around punta cana we took advantage of the atv tour and snorkeling and enjoyed both - pools are kept very clean and they are spacious enough to enjoy a nice swim they are very refeshing and cool enjoyed the spa services the spa is very pretty and the after sun treatment was excellent i hope this helps 
pool was great we were at the gran bahia nov 17 to 21 and i must say it was a bit like fawlty towers the only thing that was missing was basil asking for a wake up call was a joke , since we either got one at 7:15am regardless of the time we asked for or none at all the maid service was okay , not the greatest the food was okay , but the meat tended to be undercooked , which is not a good thing the pool was great , loved it the bar service was great the mexican restaurant was unbelievable , so yummy the shows at night were fun i probably wo not go back to this resort i found it to be too big 
great vacation with the kids i am back from a relaxing vacation ( yes with the kids - 4 yrs and 8 mos ) at gran bahia principe i finally settled on the bahia after much online research it was highly rated on trip advisor and we wanted to stay in a resort chain with a good reputation so we would have a worry free vacation i will give my review and a few tips we found helpful for travelling with our children we stayed on the bavaro side of the hotel and requested a room closest to the buffet this is a huge resort and it was so handy staying close to the lobby , buffet and entertainment areas the beach is furthest away with all the rooms situated between the lobby and the beach we stayed in building 38 which was very handy to the lobby flightthe skyservice flight to punta cana was excellent , left on time , staff were great and a breakfast sandwich was offered the return flight smooth with a sandwich offered for lunch the staff were very helpful take some special treats and a couple new toys and i found cheerios were a gret diversion for a baby there is a changetable located in the bathrooms the punta cana airport has a number of little shops for browsing and snacks upon arrival they take your photo which you then pick up on your return to the airport there are some sections which are air conditioned and some are not wear your shorts and pack your pants to change into on the plane or at home because the airport is so hot in some sections and waiting in line to check in can be very frustrating especially with children check inyou are transported by a large coach to the hotel i was worried aboout taking car seats vs not and found that it was not really necessary and the ride was smooth and the road was not busy so i found it to be quite safe you are given an envelope with your room number while on the bus which was convenient we had our wrist bands and were ready to enjoy the resort as soon as we got there also in your envelope is a pass port guide to the hotel and towel cards check in is at 3pm but we found that when we asked if our room might be ready early as we wanted the put our daughter down for a nap that we could get in the room by 2pm also at check - in ask for your safe to be set up if you will require it ( the cost is $4 a day ) it gave us peace of mind leaving any valuables in the room roomsthe rooms are set up in 3 level buildings if you have kids , request a ground level room it 's so much easier the rooms are apparently king bed or 2 doubles i requested a king but got two doubles - oh well , it ended up being fine there is also a large wide sofa in the room which would work well for a child 's bed rooms are equipped with a tv with a fair number of channels ( mostly spanish but a few english as well ) including nickelodeon there is a minibar fridge which we used to store bottles of baby food it is stocked daily so you never run out of pop , beer or water the bottled water is excellent for making bottles or taking to the beach as you should not be drinking the tap water in dr we were given a playpen , although over the phone i was told it would be a crib and not a playpen when i asked specifically nonetheless is was in good condition and suited our needs a la carte restaurantsas has been mentioned , on a week 's vacation , you can book 3 a la carte dinners i would do so early ( possibly even as soon as you arrive and are waiting for your room ) as we found most were fully booked until at least 5 days into our trip there are 6 options and 1 additional new bbq restaurant a la cartes we had the japenese ( excellent and our son watched his dvd player at the table while we ate ) , gourmet ( we found the service to be not so great with the expection of julianna who was lovely , they have a kids menu ) las olas was the new bbq restaurant we were offered because the others were full we found out is is really the beach buffet so we were not too excited about that as it was not a true a la carte i have heard the garden grill ( steakhouse ) is excellent and there is also an italian , seafood and mexican restaurants on the bavaro side the bavaro guests are able to dine in the a la cartes on the bavaro side and not on the punta cana side and vice versa they also have seperate buffets buffetthe buffet was very good here you can eat at the main buffet restaurant , the seafood or mexican restaurant ( also buffets open at breakfast and lunch ) there is so much variety and most is very tasty it is open a little late for dinner when you have kids (7-10pm ) but we found that we all just adjusted our schedules slightly and they were fine we would often feed my daughter (8 mos ) a jar of food in the room beforehand and then give her some cheerios to snack on while we ate for breakfast , the is breads , bagels , cereals , eggs , pancakes , french toast , fresh fruits , juices , smoothies , omelets and eggs to order , pastries , jams and a variety of other dishes for lunch , there are salads , breads for sandwiches , hot dogs , burgers , pizza , pasta , soups , and various dishes of the day the dinners are in a different theme each night ( spanish , american , italian , mexican , dominican , asian and a gala dinner on saturday ) we loved the mexican and dominican nights - delicious the details are amazing including towers of desserts , ice sculptures , carved melons , and sugar and bread sculptures which decorate the buffet area there was always 4-5 selections each night specifically for kids often , it was fried foods but it was nice that they thought of this my son loved the pizza , pasta , fresh fruits , eggs , juices and we would often make him sandwiches for lunch the staff were sometimes friendly , sometimes cool but were always at your service and plates and dishes were always cleared right away it might be helpful to learn a few key phrases in spanish - the staff really appreciated it and your kids will learn some works in a new language beachwe did not spend alot of time here with the kids my son was leary of the ocean waves and it was often rough and babies and sand are not the best mix if you do go , take along a few towels to make a beach blanket there is plenty of shade and tons of beach chairs there is a trolley that runs from the lobby to the beach every few minutes you never have to wait long there is a ship wreck right in front of the resort in the ocean apparently a wreck from the 70s we were told interesting to see poolsgorgeous and warm there are 2 pools - one located at the beach ( the large main pool ) and a smaller central pool located halfway along the little road that runs the length of the resort there is a 3rd diamond club pool but unless you 've upgraded you cannot swim here both pools have seperate kiddie areas , gradual entries and pool bars the pool bars had a variety of refreshments for kids like juices and slushy drinks we spent almost all day every day at the pool there are shady areas in the pool and my we always dressed my son in his suit , a t - shirt and hat to keep him out of the sun as much as we could because he was in the pool most of the day there are lots of chairs ( provided you arrive before 10ish ) and shade covers i found i did not need a playpen at the pool , because my daughter either was in the pool or sat with us on the beach chair sleeping or playing 
dont worry - great vacation hello , very helpful website - i used it alot before we travelled , so i thought i 'd return the favour i travelled with my wife , and 2 kids , ages 4 and 10 months my wife and i have been to a few places in cuba and mexico before so i have enough to compare to this hotel is in my top 2 we might be slightly biased because we speak spanish , so it was alot easier for us weather was incredible poured one nite ( we were sleeping anyway ) , and rained one day for about 20 minutes , and the sun came right out again arrival and flight november 2008sunwing airlines from toronto airportflight times were brutal , depart : 7am to 11am , return : 10pm to 2am we were worried that the kids might suffer , but they did not maybe just luck , but they just slept the whole time all things considered , flight was not bad rooms rooms were great i booked only days before we left and right away sent an email to the hotel requesting ground floor , near the pool and a playpen for an infant when we arrived , they gave us 2 out of 3, and sent us the playpen asap when i called front desk rooms were always cleaned well ac worked fine restaurants buffet restaurant : great better than most other resorts always plenty to choose from , we are all picky ( ok not me ) , and we all found plenty to eat , even my 10 month old daughter a la cartes : even better we went to japanese ( fun and food was fine ) , mexican ( we loved the buffet appetizers , main was ok ) and steakhouse ( pretty good ) bars service was usually good , not always the quickest , but c 'mon , you 're on vacation lighten up and just enjoy , no one should be on a schedule or in a rush when on vacation tips do help of course , but in general , tip or no tip , service was fine drinks did vary in strength , but again , who cares not enough booze too much booze beach and pools beach is amazing beautiful , beautiful did not spend too much time at the beach because the kids didnt like it too much , but when there , it 's paradise pools are great , kids loved it brought my 4 year old his own life jacket , he had a blast my little girl totally loved it never thought it was too dirty or over - crowded when we wanted quiet , we 'd go to one section , when we wanted music and noise we moved to that section trolley services were quick and convenient , but the wife always wanted to walk lots of walking , but for the amount of food you eat , its probably a good thing always people cleaning , watering , painting , fixing pics do not lie , just take a look at some of the ones posted activities and entertainment did not do any 'partying ' - it was a family vacation we saw 1 show , the lion king , not great , but not bad the boy loved it didnt get to see the club , casino or late shows tours stayed at the resort the whole time , again because we had the kids , otherwise we would have ventured off for sure conclusion overall we had a wonderful time , so relaxing and care - free dominicans are the best people , they all knew my kids ' names by the end of the week , and always said hi , please , thank you and with pleasure again , maybe because we spoke the language we had a bit of an advantage , but when we spoke in english , most of the staff helped adequately yes , some dont speak english , but hey , you 're in a spanish speaking country however , at the front desk , they spoke perfect english , and all you have to do is ask ask and ask pretty easy if you ask me lots of europeans , yes , mainly spaniards no one bugged me too much , except some rude and loud canadians next door yes , you 're on vacation , but be considerate if you want to make noise at 1am , go to the bar , disco , or even your balcony not the front foyer no need to even leave the resort ( we did not ) and the shops are of course overpriced , but not too too bad , considering it is in the hotel negotiate with the vendors i bought stuff from the vendors that cost 2 or 3 times more at the airport and even then i probably got a little ripped off bottom line - if you 're not a snob , then do not worry about this place , you will have an incredible time nothing to really complain about at all , especially for the great price we got would definitely go back ca not understand the bad reviews all i can guess is that something went wrong , by bad luck , and it just ruined the vacation , or they are simply miserable people 
terrible staff and th eplace is very unorganized i travel south every winter , this was by far the worst vacation spot ever the management was terrible , they lied to us , the cockroaches were many the food was not good , the grounds were nice , looked clean but we seen 3 large rats very poor attitude , tips were everything you had to tip big for everything they even asked for tips if you were not a big tip person you did not receive attention , esp drinks the rooms were not cleans unless you called ahead and asked for cleaning , very few towels in the washroom , no facecloths they never replaced towels daily , you had to call and ask there were insects in the rooms , we had to spray every night the door keys kept dying , you had to get them recoded , thus wasting time in the front office , which always had huge line ups drugs , if your looking to buy drugs they sell it on the property in the market the workers in the flee market area outside the casino will ask you if your looking to buy smoke they even asked my 17 year nephew if he wanted to but pot not a nice place to spend your vacation i wrote the hotel management and head office about my concerns and the drugs , they offered me a 3 night stay my entire 7 night stay was a mess , very unhappy with the staff and managment

are we all talking about the same place we recently got back from our stay at the gran bahia ( july 2-16) , and i felt compelled to write a review i am so surprised to see so many negative reviews from others who stayed at the same time while i have some suggestions for the hotel , i would definately have to say that our stay was wonderful if you have booked your trip and are reading these negative reviews , do not worry if you are ready to have a good time you will we spoke to several people over our stay and everyone was generally pleased please forgive the long review , but i want to be as objective and thorough as possible reception desk : we arrived at the hotel around 2:30 and were taken to our room right away there is a fee for the safe if you are planning to do this , do it when you arrive , the desk is often tied up with people coming back to activate the safe , and it can be a real hassle to wait on line our room : the room was clean , beautiful , spacious and comfortable the fridge was not consistently cold , but if you stuck a bevarage in ice for a few minutes it would be ready to drink mini bar has beer , soda and water this was stocked everyday and often a few extra beers were thrown in because we had asked for a couple extra the first night there was also a coffee maker in the room the service to the room was great on one occasion we did not have towels and they brought them over right away they also provided us with a iron and ironing board immediately upon our request we did not have anything taken out of our room hotel grounds : the grounds are large and immpecable everything was clean and well groomed they are big , but i found this to be a plus if you want a small hotel this is not the place for you they do provide a tram service which runs from the lobby to the beach the trams run frequently , but we generally walked security was all along the path in the evening and we always felt very safe be sure to note where your villa is we became a little disoriented the first night and all the villas look the same beach : the beach was clean there were a ton of chairs and palapas , so we never had difficulty finding a spot the water was refreshing and there is a shipwreck directly in front of the hotel towels were readily available with the card exchange system we were alwasy able to get a clean dry towel pools : the pools were large and they all have swim up bars the bartenders were extremely friendly , and yes they might call you friend , but i only see this as a positive they were always friendly and pleasant the service was excellent and we never waited very long for drinks entertainment staff by the pool was excellent as well activities were offered , but not forced on anyone the water aerobics were fun they must have been effective too because i did not gain any weight which brings me to food : the buffet was probably on of the best i 've seen at an all inclusive they did vary the menu daily and there was always something to eat they were constantly restocking everything as far as the a la carte we enjoyed the garden grill ( steakouse ) , the japanese , the gourmet and the dominican the seafood was not our favorite the snack bar by the beach was convenient , but the variety was much better in the main buffet , so we mostly ate there mini - club : we traveled with my 8 year old and she used the mini - club while we were there several times they seemed to have plenty for the kids to do and she enjoyed it , but the hours were 9-12:30 and 2:20-4:45, so sometimes it required more effort to coordinate the times there were also a few days when the hours were shortened and they opened later they leave the club for activities too , so they might not be at the location when you drop off if it 's in the middle of a session they had a mini - disco every night and on most nights a game they game was also called off on a few nights when the mc was unavailable this was not a sign - in service and we would hang out to watch it they also had a lion king show where the kids are able to participate , which was pretty cool staff : they were extremely friendly and were always having a good time i do not know if they are this way with everyone , but if you are friendly to them they are twice as nice back we encountered plenty of rude people during our stay maybe they are the ones getiing the poor service , but we never had any issues entertainment : shows at night were held at 9:45 we enjoyed the circus and lion king , but did not go every night , because we were ready for bed minor suggestions for the hotel :1 include the safe in the rate , so people do not feel nickel and dimed i 'd have rather paid the extra up - front also it creates congestion at the reception desk put shower curtains in the bathrooms we found it difficult to shower without flooding the bathroom3 post or distribute an activity schedule , so people will know what activities are offered and when make sure the activities are consistent or note publicly when they will vary it 's frustrating to go all the way to the mini - club to find out that it is closed for an extra hour at lunch time also hire people to fill in when the regulars are out , so the activities can continue in their absence e mini disco game 
definitely not a 5 star hotel we have travelled quite a few times to the caribbean but this was our first time to punta cana we travelled with a fairy large group - 28 people from june 24 - july 1 ages ranged from 1 to 60 including teenagers i agree with the other reviewers when they say that there are a lot of children at this resort this was good for me as i was travelling with my two young sons so i apologize in advance if it was my stroller you tripped over we flew on sunwing the flight was good , getting our luggage at the airport went smoothly but we had to walk across the parking lot to our bus with all of our luggage , a bit of a pain but not really a big deal for some reason , and i have never seen this before , we did not check in at the hotel but rather on the bus we had to fill out all kinds of paperwork while the bus was driving over some really bumpy roads , not the easiest thing to do this meant that once we arrived at the hotel , we went straight to our room the thing is , we noticed that our room was nowhere near anyone else 's room we did book our trip separately from the rest of the group so we thought it would be easy to switch room , quess again when we asked the rude person at the front desk if we could be moved closer to my family , he flat out said no he said that we requested an oceanview room ( which does not exist ) and that our room was considered an upgrade we did not ask for an oceanview room and we did not require the upgrade they would not fulfill our request they flat out said no , they were filled to capacity the room was very spacious when we got there , the cleaning staff had just started cleaning our room we asked her for four bath towels everyday and 4 bottles of water we gave her $10 she thanked us for the money but we never saw four towels each day we received a different amounts , different sized and forget about the water since my youngest son is only 1, we used the bottled water to make his bottles of milk and clean his bottles and sippy cups i ca not believe how many times we had to call and ask for water on one occasion they even brought us an open bottle our room was clean but for some reason , the maid stopped putting the comforter on our bed i guess she thought that it was too hot to use , whatever the beach was alright i still think cuba has nicer beaches maybe not as much shade but definitely nicer beaches we really enjoyed the pool and pool entertainment on one of the days , my older son got treated to a show with mickey mouse and elmo i felt sorry for the guys in the costumes because it was definitely hot there have been lots of comments about the food there definitely was a good variety but after 3 days , i developed the runs i had to take antibiotics when i returned home the only thing i can think made me sick was the salad out of the 28 people that i travelled with , i got it the worst one person from our flight had to be hospitalzed because of the food ok , the worst part of the trip i understand that we were a large group , but we never asked to be seated together you should have seen the look on the person standing at the lobby buffet whenever we showed up it was like she had to go and construct the tables and chairs herself since i did have a baby , i would ask for a high chair i know they had them but good luck getting one in under 30 minutes i usually sat holding my son for most of the dinner it took forever to get a drink and the a/c was never on we would joke and say that they purposefully would not turn it on so you woud not stay long all in all , the resort was very beautiful the entertainment was good ( night and day ) , although the night entertainment was held in an outside theater that was unbelievably hot the food was not so good and the service was terrible definitely not the 5 star i expected 
good times at bahia principe stayed at bahia principe june 8th - june 15th i 'll start with the punta cana airport cute and quant and not airconditioned seems that they need to work on the schedule of multiple planes arriving at once since it ca not handle large crowds overall , it still moved along pretty fast lines looked overwhelming but moved quickly just like in cancun , baggage handlers try and get your bags for tips walk right past them to your travel rep we booked with apple vacations and had a great experience buses were clearly marked and easier to find than in cancun check in moved quickly and 2 out of our 3 rooms were ready well before check in time of 3:00pm carts take you and luggage directly to your room rooms were clean but nothing spectacular linens were rather stained but were changed daily it was sometimes difficult to get a full set of towels for each person in the room beware of treacherous entry in and out of tub/shower my dad fell on his first trip out of the shower there is only a partial glass wall and the water gets all over it 's a rather steep step out of the tub with no grab bar to hold on to if any traveler has physical limitations , it would be very difficult to manage rooms all come equipped with umbrellas which were really appreciated the day it poured all day and night the rain also brought out the flying insects and our room was loaded with the wings from these critters not the bugs themselves , just the wings everywhere grounds are very well kept the resort is large but easy to learn your way around it 's not really a bad walk however in the heat of the day , it 's miserable never had a bad wait for the trolley and there were 7 of us food was your standard buffet there are different theme nights in the buffet mexican night was our favorite the ala carte restaurants were ok most of these restaurants still have a partial buffet for salads and appetizers too many servers waiting on you that all expect a tip the frozen drinks all tasted the same to me they come out of a machine so do not expect great drinks the lobby bar was by far the best pools were all very nice pool by the beach got very crowded late in the afternoon never had a problem finding beach or pool chairs even in the shade we went down about 8:30am to get our same spot but if you 're not picky about where you want to sit , there were plenty chairs in sun or shade you ca not walk out very far into the ocean which was disappointing it 's a fairly quick drop off we preferred the beaches in the riviera maya we did the banana boats , parasail ( overpriced ) , and sunset cruise i highly recommend the sunset cruise even though you wo not actually see the sunset you 'll have a great time for $35 each , you 'll get a 2 hour ride which includes snorkeling and all the rum and cokes you can drink you 'll also stop at an area off shore that is only chest high and party with all the other boats we all had a great time and the ages ranged from 71 to 18 do not bother taking a taxi to the shopping in punta cana it was $40 each way for 4 people shopping plaza at the hotel has cute little shops the cart vendors are all very annoying and by the 2nd night , i had enough of them to never want to go back they wo not let up until you buy something from them the help at the hotel were all very friendly most speak only spanish but heck , that 's their native language a few phrases of spanish will be helpful my biggest complaint was the rudeness of the other guests smokers everywhere not caring about anyone else people walking down the paths 3 deep and not moving when approached by people from the other direction it 's as if they think they own the sidewalk trolley riders not wanting to move over to share their seats people watching the evening shows and talking loudly over the music to be heard if you want conversation , go to the lobby bar so the rest of us can enjoy the shows the room below me called security on us saying we were too loud we were sound asleep when someone came knocking on my door at midnight and then called the room because i did not answer the door unless i was dead , i could not possibly have been any quieter than sound asleep when i confronted the man on why he called , he was a total jerk i will say the worst part of the entire trip was the complete disregard of other people by the guests overall , we had a great time and dispite some minor inconveniences , i would recommend this hotel to others just do not expect a 5 star hotel the trip is what you make of it 
holiday from hell gran bahi principe bavaromay 27th 2008member thame oxonholiday from helljust got back bavaro never had a holiday like this ever and whish not to go throught this again the buffett food was cold uncooked and tasteless went to the garden grill for a meal 1st time meal came out cold called the waiter which he exchanged for me waited 10 mins for it to re apear yet again cold had a word with the resterant manager no joy didnt understand me , so i went to reception was told no manager about after a few heated words the night manager apeared from nowhere , he then got us in to the italian resturant ordered our meal which was the pork loin cut straight in to check and blood come running out no joy again with the resteraunt manager all intal we did not eat evening meals for 6 night out of the 14 because the food was so bad the reception staff are so ruid and will not let you speak to any managers at all unless you realy get irated there is plenty of building work going on there and we sat in the diamond swimming pool everyday and all you could hear or seeis the builders working which is a 12 hour day we paid extra to upgrade on this holiday and was not told that the diamond was close also due to renovations plenty of building work going on there to the only thing that this hotel as got going for them is the clean room and the hardworking maids as some of you already pointed out the drinks taste watered down and when you ask for premuim drinks they give you local ones i defentley think this hotel is the worst ive ever visited in the dr and will never go back there again and it is not a 5 star hotel more like 3star i will be posting photos of the lovely building sites later 
nice , clean , we were 8 adults with no kids traveling together grounds very well kept , rooms , nice suite with large bath housekeeping they did a great job buffet , ( lobster on friday nights was really good ) food was hot and large selection , but seemed a bit repetiverestarants , not that great would rather have buffet we tried 4if you want some peace and quite good luck trying to find a spot ( maybe in your room if there wer not people trying to cross your balcony , did i mention we were on the 3rd floor not the hotels fault if you want to tip that 's great , but do not tip to get better service chances are you wont see them again ( place is too big ) too many people too many kids tram ( train ) there was 4 going most of the day some where full could not relax i know next time smaller resort i think the amber would 've been a better choice people from bavaro side and the punta cana side are not allow at the amber yes would 've been better 
not a worry free vacation i am a mother of a 7 year old and 13 year old boys my 13 year old is in the international hospital in bavaro with my husband my son has gotten a bacterial infection from the hotel and is on an iv as i type and is receiving treatment i am here at the resort with my 7 year old son waiting for them to come back to the resort , after 2 sleepless nights i had plans to call my husband at 9 o 'clock in the evening to find out how our son is doing and hopped on one of the resorts shuttle buses to make it back to our room i informed the driver that i would like him to stop at villa 26 he responded si even though i sat right behind him he did not stop but proceeded to travel to the end of the long road he went to the end of the road and stopped it was my 7 yr old and i with this driver i asked him why he did not stop and he motioned he would on the way back i assumed he forgot he ducked down , as not to be seen , and ate and drank we were there for what seemed to be an eternity i had missed my window to call about my son i was upset and my 7 yr old looked worried another bus finally arrived and he began to move again i asked him to stop at villa 26 and he replied no comprende i was now very worried i asked him to stop , he replied no comprende he did not stop till he was back at the front of the hotel we are talking about a 15 minute trip i went to talk to the manager on call and he did not seem concerned till i was visually upset and the other vacationers noticed then they became eager to accomodate the bus with driver continued i asked them to call the driver back the angrier i got and the more frustrated i got only then did they begin to listen i waited till his bus came by again and took a picture of him with my digital camera i will be posting it when i return home no upgrade or special treatment will take away a mothers worry for her son she was with and the other one in the hospital i do not recommend this place for anyone traveling with young children for many reasons since this whole ordeal i have also found out that the police will not come to the hotel problems are to be resolved on the hotel i asked 6 different employees for the telephone number and none new the number of the police thank you for listening and this has been a way for me to gather my thoughts and vent while writting my review i have discovered what i will ask this hotel to do i will ask them to drive me to the hospital it 's about 35 minutes away i wonder how accomodating they will be when it does not involve a suite upgrade please feel free to contact me if you would like more details 
good resort but watch your belongings my husband and i just came back from the gran bahia principe this was our 6th time in the caribbean been to cuba 3 times , punta cana twice and the mayan riviera once in a nutshell , good resort beach is far from resort , however , the tram is always available to take you for a 5 star hotel , i was suprised that some of the things like safety deposit box , and the banana boat were not included we had to pay $35 for the box not a big deal deal but at 3 and 4 star hotels we have been to had the box included do not leave your belongings on the beach or by the pool my husband had his sandals taken , his prescription sunglasses taken and i had a beach towel from home taken , on 3 separate occasions the food is excellent , the service was good too the beach is miles of white sand and turquoise water you ca not ask for better pools are nice too kept very clean there are vendors on the beach , about 45 min walk on the beach or you can take a boat taxi for about $5 per person you must barter with them cause they will try and get more form you the vendors are very aggresive so be prepared they also want a lot of money for their goods so you really have to be firm and bring them down to what you are willing to pay a neat experience though there are plenty of vendors right on the hotel property also in the courtyard so you really do not have to leave the resort if you prefer not to the rooms were kept very clean the maids really like little gifts from us things like cosmetics , toothbrushes and paste , and candy overall , a great time aside from having our things taken , we had a good time , ate well , had great beach time 
five star - not returned on april 27, 2008not very impressed this was not a five star hotel the ocean at the beach had lots of seaweed floating around we had cockroaches in our room the entertainment was pretty sad bacon was only available 2 mornings out of the 7 ( what 5 star runs out of bacon there are alot better places than this , and i do not understand why it is rated so high save your money and go to a different hotel 
just bad luck i was on vacation with my wife in bahia principle between november 12 and november 20, 2007 and can say that was one of the worst experiences we had as tourists the beach is spectacular , and food 5 * , but for the rest , without words it all started in the evening when we reached to the room , the employee left the bag in the room and not accepted 1 euro tip , claiming that it had no value ( i only had notes of 100 dollares ) on the same night the first sign appeared , a cockroach in the bathroom , which i killed without saying anything to my wife on the following morning appears a new cockroach on top of one of the bags with about 5 cm that i kill after these events , i talk with reception and tehy informed us that they were spraying the room , but this has not happened the day passed with a spectacular beach and a pool very pleasant when reached the night before our trip to the island saona ( which i have only one word - spectacular ) , new adventure , as were 4 of the morning when my wife went to the bathroom and suddenly appears one more cockroach on the wall with some 7 cm , yjat i tried to kill it but not succeed i drag the closet , when appears another cockroach near of the wardrobe this was limit , i think to myself that i took vacation with my wife and not with a family of cockroaches i call to the reception but no one appears after 1 hour , then i walk throught the reception about 6am and explain the situation to the boy that told me there is nothing he could do because the manager is found just at 8am , i want to leave a comment but he said that they dont have paper and pen that was the limit after one amazing day on isla saona , we arrived to the hotel , and a new adventure , as i go directly to the reception and talks with the manager which was very attentive after i explain the situation he told us that couldn?t do anything because the hotel was full and asked why not ask before man , on this time i was dinamite and i explained that the employee who attended us in the morning says that haven?t paper or pens to wrote a message after this explanation and my wife in panic bagging to change , the manager give us a new room without knowing what would be happening in the following days , when we wnt into the new room there are no towells in the bath and no ropes but as knew that the room was not yet ready its ok the day after we went to one more day at the beach but for our surprise , when we reached by 5pm we had no towels in the bathroom again i talk with the housekeeper and she explained to us that the service in this room was lower ( the other room has golden serv ) as such these rooms were the latest to receive towels i dont believe in that i have heard there are 6pm when we receive only 2 of towels the day after new episode , they had put towels in the bathroom were old and were torn on next day we had left by mistake ou mobile phone on the table of the room and it was stolen i talk with the housekeeper but she swore that she had not seen anything to worse the situation , we went into the room about 5 pm , and there are no towels again was the limit , i went directly to the carrier soltour ( travel agency for which hire the holidays ) , i explain the situation to the lady but shewas very rude , thats reach my nerves , i exploded and i spoke everything that i had to talk , five minutes later i have 6 towels on my room i tried to talk about the stolen mobile but tthe lady ignores me because me and my wife are people with heart , after thinking in the housekeeper dropping tears all over her face when i confrontated her about the stolen phone and telling us that she would be target of a crime process , we decided not presenting any complaint this was not the end of the story lol ( not so funny one those days ) , because the day after during the night we went to gift shop and we were poorly attended by the lady and gave us sacks with holes , lol , unbelieveble in the same night were 10 50 pm and in the lobby bar they refused to serve us a drink saying that the bar was closed when closes only at 11pm it is incredible what happened and the way it happened after this experience , bahia principe has been excluded from my list , for ever 
great getaway if you 're planning a trip to this resort the first thing to keep in mind is that this is not a five star facility five star resorts do not have marble tiled bathrooms with cheap plastic tubs sunk in five star resorts do not introduce you to the maid at check in only to change them daily without notice five star resorts are also never this affordable that being said , this is one of the best 3-31/2 star resorts i 've ever stayed at and the price was fantastic my wife and i and our 4 year old daughter stayed here 4/5-4/12 and had a wonderful vacation most of the negatives we experienced had to do with other guests the place was full of french canadians and russians , many of whom seemed to have a total disregard for simple manners i ca not tell you how many times my daughter was almost trampled by people pushing and cutting into the buffet , tram , lobby , etc oh well , i guess this winter made these people miserable the resort itself is beatiful and clean the staff for the most part was friendly and helpful some advice : like others have said , make restaurant reservations early the club golden upgrade is well worth the extra couple of hundred bucks to be near the pools and beach learn a little spanish bring as many supplies like sunscreen with you as the shops are a complete ripoff the buffets have great food if you look for it be adventurous and try something new remember that life in the caribbean moves at a leisurely pace do not get upset if your coffee does not arrive immediately when you sit down take a deep breath , remind yourself that you are on vacation , and enjoy the fabulous sunshine , soft breezes , immaculate pools and beaches , hilarious bartenders and the smug satisfaction that your friends are back home hating life 
good resort we stayed at the gran bahia principe from 4/1 - 4/8 we booked through bpusa which is the resort 's website i had no problems booking , although i was booking two rooms and requested they be in same villa and they were not this posed no problems however i read reviews on trip advisor and was a bit concerned if you have booked a trip and are worried based on reviews , don?? be this is a huge resort and you are not going to get individualized attention but you should lack for nothing we had to have a ground floor room due to my husband 's recent ankle injury and i was worried about bugs , there were a few but not many and i have been to multiple caribbean resorts and have had many more the rooms are spacious and clean , maids did a nice job but you might want to leave a few dollars every day to get that extra attention you will not go hungry there are two buffets with decent food and quite a few of a la carts restaurants book your a la carts right away , they are the way to go we dined at the mexican , mediterranean , japanese and the steakhouse and all were wonderful the only problem i had with it is the time regulations involved in the restaurants they open and close promptly at the stated times and when you are on vacation it is nice to have flexibility once you understand there are no variations on time you will do fine the entertainment is fine i enjoy participating in all the resorts have to offer and think this resort is a little slow paced for my very active family , albeit there may have been more going on and we were not aware of it due to the size of the resort if you are thinking of booking this resort and have any difficulties with mobility i would suggest you look elsewhere while i thought this resort was great , it is hard for those with any disabilities to move about my husband broke his ankle a few weeks before our trip and thank heavens i rented him a knee scooter to get around , otherwise we would have been in a world of trouble i hope this review is helpful to those who are booking or have already booked it really is a lovely resort to stay 
bahia - boo hoo arrived at the bahia principe march 29, 2008 - the rooms we were originally booked into were facing a construction site my intention was to be at a resort not a construction zone - be aware buildings 36 and 30 have rooms facing this construction that i am sure will continue for the next many months found the registration person - hector to be arrogant and not helpful dining staff in all areas were great - especially the grill house had diamond club access so we were able to eat at the italian restaurant for breakfast and lunch - so avoided the cattle call at the larger dining room buffet there was almost nonexistent service around the diamond pool the number of children roaming the hotel til late into the night was disturbing , especially at the karaokee bar after midnight we were a group of four women - i would definitely not recommend this resort if you are trying to relax next time we will go to an adults only resort 
rummy fun at gran bahia : boats , beaches , bars and just one funny smell we were trying not to panic after booking the edenh real back in january ???? sure it??l be fine??hose people are probably just picky? yeah , that?? it??lass on the beach no problem??istfights over the beach chairs ( panic rising ) ??ure , well??ey who doesn?? love a good brawl br/>so when sears travel called to tell us the resort was overbooked , the call went something like this : sears : the edenh is overbooked we were wondering? br/>us : yesyes a thousand times yes we were mentally prepared for our air canada vacations super - annoying three - flight deal ( london - toronto - montreal - punta cana ) we were not prepared for our london flight to be cancelled due to weather we left the london airport at 8, and hoped that in the weather that barred planes from taking off , we?? be able to get to toronto on time we arrived at 11:10 for our 11:45 flight , and frightfully added a $160 parking fee onto our trip luckily for us , our toronto flight was delayed , and we ended up at the montreal airport at 2 am the punta cana airport is delightful with the thatched roof , the local musicians playing as you enter , the winsome locals costumed for your ( $8) photo opportunity , it?? all very fun air canada gave us a card that covered our $10 entrance fee to the country the last time we were in punta cana , we had a $25 departure tax , so we were prepared for that as we left , but it was never charged air canada must have swung some sweet deal or they saw us coming with our over - sized , thermal ( hello travel mugs and figured us loud , soon - to - be - drunken neanderthals weren?? worth the bother with polite direction from an air canada rep , we made our way to our quickly departing coach bus , where wendel , a tri - lingual ( french , english and spanish ) customer service representative from the resort distributed our bracelets , room keys , and maps on the bus as soon as we arrived at the resort , i made a quick right into the guest services room to book our a la cartes , while my husband was immediately whisked with our bags to our rooms i spoke with jean , and immediately booked the garden grill and mikado , the two we had decided on previously after i expressed some ( charming ) indecision between the dominican and the brazilian , jean offered to seat us for both we also had friends that greased the guest services people with a 20 for an extra dinner , and ones that got an extra one by showing up a little early to one of the a la cartes our room (17105) was on the ground floor of the 3rd building away from the lobby , and one building away from the centre pool?? great location , we decided , for going to dinner in high heels , stumbling home after karaoke , running for more sunblock from the pool , and a nice walk to beach to work off some of the room was cool , and not musty at all we especially loved the marble bathroom with jacuzzi tub ( which i tried , and was very relaxing ) a few ( completely minor ) annoyances : the tv has no channel listing , and no numbers to press on the remote to go to a specific channel there is no clock or iron in the room ( although we borrowed one from guest services that came immediately , and was followed up by 2 phone calls to be sure that we had it and enjoyed it first impression of the main buffet : yum no , sorry that was my second impression my first impression was : why does the lobby smell like a bathroom even the ( very well - appointed ) lobby bathroom doesn?? smell like a bathroom while waiting in the lobby , i heard a little kid ask his mom why the lobby of the buffet smelled so bad mom : that?? just the smell of every food in the buffet blending together because i??e never walked into the kitchen while my husband?? making a stir - fry and thought , ??ooh , garbage water and sewage br/>i enjoyed the buffet : i really liked the stewed meat ( very tender??he average piece of beef in dr is tough??robably because it?? not kept in a tiny pen like in na??ut not if it?? been stewed ) , rice and beans??uthentic dominican food i had a hot dog , which was also perfectly good i thought the service in the main buffet was consistent all servers made an attempt to speak the language of their guests ( whether it been english , french or german ) , and appreciated your massacring of their romantic language i never waited for agua or caf? con leche , which i appreciated we explored the resort , and quickly found a spot under a palapa at the pool ( at 3 pm ) the pool bar service was quick , although we found the bartender fernando a lot friendlier and faster than feliciano while they don?? have strawberry daquiris ( my favourite ) , they had 6 different kinds of slushie mixes : pina colada , lemon , coco loco ( straight coconut ) , a chocolateish one , blue hawaii ( coconut and blue curacao ) and sometimes an orangey one as well the walk to the beach is not bad at all yes , the resort is big , but we often beat the tram walking down to the beach from the lobby , it is about 8-10 minutes at a brisk pace , but there are plenty of stops along the way if you want to jump on a tram part - way the pool right by the beach is very big ( although not as expansive as other resorts i??e seen ) , and seemed to be really busy , especially with kids the other pools were not available to us , and didn?? seem to be busy at all the beach is gorgeous the sand is not hot , and is very light and soft the water is a beautiful green we absolutely loved the waves , and got some ??ody boards? from the sports centre ( located at the right end of the beach if you??e facing the water ) you can borrow them for an hour with a 20 dollar deposit ( each ) we found that you could ??ide the waves? timing a jump right just as well the water has no rocks at all along the shore , but we found when the water was calm , there was more ??tuff? and other natural debris ) swirling around your legs we got up at 7:30 everyday to get a good spot on the beach : under a palapa , with a table and chairs , right in front of the bar our friends got up at 9:30, and had no problem finding chairs in the sun the first night we went to the garden grille the service was wonderful : empty glasses , plates and warm towels were swept away by the many servers immediately after use the caesar salad bar was a bit of a disappointment : iceberg lettuce , and a strange - tasting dressing i actually found that most salad dressings throughout the resort had a bitter taste to me : almost like a sour vinegar my husband had the steak ( cooked medium rare ) and also the shrimp brioche , and i had the beef ribs , both were ??ood? served with crispy onions and a plantain wrap and potato for dessert , i had a pineapple crisp with ice cream that was super , super sweet the pineapple there is so sweet naturally that glazing it makes it almost inedible the restaurant had very nice ambiance and friendly service the dominican restaurant was a little tough to find : it?? in the premiere section , past the lobby ( toward the road ) on the ??avaro side? of the resort ( the left if you??e facing the water ) the restaurant is open air , and they served a nice welcome drink this restaurant also had a small buffet for appetizers , and i enjoyed the dominican soup they serve plaintain and sweet potato chips and shrimp appetizer which was good i had the bass with coconut sauce ( nice ) , and my husband had lobster ( half ) with creole sauce that he said was cooked well the brazilian restaurant is in the open air restaurant on the beach that is the snack bar during the day a buffet is offered for appetizers as usual , then the waiters circulate the restaurant with skewered pieces of meat on 3- foot - long metal stakes 
screwed up from the beginning feb 8,2008 i will start off by saying , i was not going to be one who was going to find things to cry about , as i was going to have a good time we were booked to go in bavaro but ended up in punta cana side well to start things off , this is my story we were a group of eight we had asked to be all together , then we asked that 2 couples have a king bed and 2 other rooms to have 2 beds in each room we asked not to be on the ground floor , we asked to be near the beach did not get what we wanted first off when we arrived , the room that was supposed to have 2 beds in each , only had king size beds we went to complain , and were told to use it for the night and tomorrow they will change it well tomorrow came in the morning , and we were told to come back later we tried to go for breakfast and we were told we did not have the proper bracelet but our friends were in there eating , which we did not know finally back to try and find our rep for signature travel , and at 12:30 she went to try and straighten it out she did move us , but not with our friends and finally at 1:30pm we were on our way to our new room i guess the frustration got to me , when we were leaving the desk that i was not paying attention and fell into this gully on the side of the sidewalk and the street i went down so hard that my arm had a blood clot the size of a tennis ball , this is no lie , my foot was swollen on one side and my knee on the other leg was swollen so off to the doctors they took me i was there 1/2 hour before they looked at me an suggested i go to there hospital about for some anti inflamatory needle no ice was giving and they seemed that they did not want to look after me at the clinic on there grounds may i say that when i was there , there was an lady of 75 years of age who had stitches over her eye and black eye and a cracked rib , she was there for her grandaughters wedding , and fell into one of the gullys also i decided to go back to our room which we had not moved out of yet and ice it and take anti inflamatory pills by the time we did get moved it was 3:30 and we were still not with our friends they were a another building farther away , we also got moved to the end of the resort , where construction was going on we were not told this the construction started at 7 am and went till 6pm daily except saturday , the day we were leaving every 10 minutes a truck would come with sand and every 10 minutes a truck would go out empty we did have a guard near our building as the construction site was only a few feet away by the next day , my arm was black and blue from the rist to the elbow , my foot was swollen , and so was the knee i had to get help getting around from my friends and setting things up for me to manage i had tried numerous times to get ahold of the signature rep , but she was always somewhere and not in her office my friends had noticed that these drain gullys are very dangerous other that this mishap , and not getting what we wanted the resort itself , is the most beautiful place i , ve been to it is so clean and friendly food was quite good , and if you did not like something there was always something else you can always eat we had seafood one night , some friends did not like it but it was not a problem , and asked for a steak instead japenese food was mouth watering we did not like the bbq restaurant it was just blaah upon returning back home , of course we were told that we should of complained louder and stuck to our guns , as to what we were promised as for the arm it has finally come down to the size of a grape and it is seven weeks later and yes i did write to the signature vacation , and have yet to have received a letter showing any wrong doing on there part i believe this accident would not have happened had we got what we were expecting , as i would not have been in that area all in all i would say that this , yes is a 5 star resort and i would go back in a heartbeat 
its 5 star , but caribbean 5 star 2 week stay2 adults + 1 3 year oldwe had a lovely holiday at this resort and i would recommend it to anybody - families , couples ( young and old ) the main point i would like to make in trying to give an impartial review is that this is caribbean 5 star - its an above average hotel for the dominican republic but you wont get the treatment here that you would wish to get at the dorchester , london - if thats what your after then you will need to spend a a couple more thousand dollars the hotel - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the resort is pretty big - about 1500 rooms - for this reason bahia principe have divided the resort into 2 hotels ( punta cana and bavaro ) the main stumbling block this causes is that if you are booked in under punta cana you cannot eat in the bavaro buffet , and vice versa once you have sorted this out your ok - but you dont get much information on arrival and i saw a few people a bit angry/confused being turned away from the wrong buffet i think the reason they have done this is to make the resort seem smaller and more personal - and i think it works as long as you are informed the hotel reception areas are ajoined , are very grand , and are a mirror image of each other this is as far as the segregation goes for most people since the accommodation is spread about the resort in blocks of around 18 rooms there are around 10 a la carte restaurants spread about the resort which you need to book for (3 bookings per room per week - but if you check with guest services each day they generally have cancellations that they will give out as extras ) the general buffet area has a very good range of food however the other thing that may confuse some is that there are several different clubs you can be checked in under ( depending on how much you have paid ) eg premier club ( a bit more expensive but is set in its own area with its own pool ) , amber ( adults only accomodation - has its own area also ) , diamond club ( has its own pool ) these give different entitlements to facilities it seems but the a la carte restaurants are open to all as long as you have a booking there are several swimming pools and the beach is really nice the grounds are the best i have seen in the caribbean and are kept very well we were hoping to be located in a room near the beach but ended up near the reception area this worked out fine however , since we were right beside one of the pools which our little boy loved and the transport runs up and down the resort all day very frequently so getting about is fine watersports - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i went diving a few times and this was pretty good - the wreck has a big barracuda living in it there are katamarans to hire (1 hour per day for each room ) - but there are only 6 available so you need to be down at the watersports center ( on beach ) early to book a day or two in advance otherwise they will all be booked up if you like snorkelling then you will have problems here since the speed boats race up and down just meters away from swimmers - making it pretty dangerous this is a shame since the corel , only 100 yards out , has alot of nice fish on it the only thing you can do is get down there before 9 am - the boats dont generally start up until this time the service - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the staff are generally very good and are very friendly and polite but be aware that this is the caribbean - they are used to taking there time here - if you expect prompt treatment all the time then you may get a bit impatient here saw a few people getting upset since they were not being served when they snapped there fingers - simple solution , dont holiday here for kids - - - - - - - - - - - - there is a kids club which do different things each day ( but they habitually end up in the pool ) its not really a creche though , and generally with just one carer available , you wont want to leave your reluctant 2 year old there the pools are great and are nice and warm , but there arent alot of activites for kids in this resort - no games room , no water slides , no play park if your kids like to swim , or like the kids club then fine , but if they want theme parks , water slides etc then you will be disappointed liked - - - - - - - hotel , accomodation , food , beach , sea ( very warm ) didnt like - - - - - - - - - - - - - - not really being able to swim in the sea for fear of being hit by a spead boatnot much information on arrivalthere is a habit for people to get up early and reserve sunbeds here ( like everywhere else i suppose ) tips - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - have $10 us for each person at the airport - they dont seem to like pesos this will avoid having to wait at the exchange counter for half an hour like i did they drive like the italians but their roads are worse so i wouldnt hire a car here unless you are really adventurous it also takes ages to get anywhere cause the roads are pretty poor taxis are quite expensive learn a little spanish if you can sometimes goes a long way 
do not sweat the small stuff i have been to punta cana six times , each a different resort all of these previous resorts had had mixed reviews but i found each of the places i had stayed just got back , 1st week in march the bahia principe is a great resort , awesome villas , beautiful grounds , great beach area with lots of beach chairs and plenty of shade from the sun ( if you so choose ) the staff was great ( mostly ) i had plenty of reasons to have a negative review , be angry and i could have done a lot of complaining while at the resort but , really it 's all about the attitude i had , unlike all my previous stays in punta cana , problems with checking in , with the restaurants , towels , and with food but i chose to have a good time , and i did the problems are trivial , and if you focus your energy on the negative , then you 'll be miserable just move on and you 'll have great time the best i found was the beach , plenty of shaded resting spots , also the live band and stage were great , the japanese restaurant - - do not miss it nothing really , for the money , i got way more than my money 's worth regardless of the little incidentals though , i would not reccomend it to my friends , only because i found it too big - - it 's like 5 resorts combined in 1 and there are way more people ( depending on timing of course ) than there are facilities but , overall , the resort is a great place to visit 
this resort explained there is a lot to learn about this place before you go , and i would really like to explain this as best i can most important of all to make absolutely clear to anyone looking at a brochure - the gran bahia punta cana  gran bahia bavaro is one and the same hotel , it also now includes the gbp ( gran bahia principe ) premier and the new gbp ambar ( new adults only hotel adjacent ) all in the same complex so if you look for a certain size of hotel from the brochure be very careful as you need to add up the following gbp punta cana 708 junior suites , gbp bavaro 540 junior suites , gbp amber 528 rooms and 188 premier therefore , you need to understand that you are going to a resort with approximately 1,900 guest rooms , the different names are in effect different receptions in the same resort when you arrive , you will be aiming for one of these receptions depending where you have booked - our booking said bavaro you drive into the complex and follow the road to a roundabout - one side is the gbp punta cana , the other , the gbp bavaro the front of the hotel is therefore effectively symmetrical - one reception each side , then one buffet restaurant each side , one japanese restaurant each side and one gourmet restaurant each side - if you can imagine the kitchen would run down the spine between both sides of the restaurants culminating with the theatre that sits between both sides this then leads out into the grounds housing all the villas , pools , restaurants and public areas all the way down to the beach we got dropped off at bavaro and after queuing up , were told that our booking was in punta cana - even though our paperwork said otherwise never mind , we waited for a bell boy to come along in a little bus that took us round to punta cana reception and queued again when i enquired if our room had two double beds instead of one king double ( we were with 2 children ) they realised it did not to their credit they changed us immediately and gave us our key , a green wrist band and a map we got back onto a bus with another bell boy and took us to villa block 28 on the second floor ( each villa has 3 floors only - dominican law states that no building can be built higher than the king palm tree which is good ) our room was more than adequate - clean , roomy , two double beds , table sofa bed , bathroom with whirlpool bath and shower only downside was it smelt of cigarettes , but not bad enough that it was unbearable wristbandscoming from the uk , i believe i am right when i say that none of our tour operators get involved with offering the different levels of clubs at this resort diamond club , premier club and hacienda club even after being to this resort , i am still unclear what each gives you - it certainly was not explained or offered at check in what is clear is that different colour wristbands give differing privileges around the resort with our green one , we could only eat in the punta cana side buffet restaurants and not any of the a la carte at lunchtimes , i but not a problem at all foodyou are only supposed to be allowed to book 3 a l carte restaurants per week with a few dollars , you could book more if you wanted the buffet restaurants are beautiful and immaculate , they really are quite special dining rooms there is a very wide spread of food , good choices and grill chefs to cook to order however , we did find like many other reviewers that by and large the experience was seemingly unnecessarily spoilt by the food being lukewarm sometimes even cold even when they brought out fresh trays they could still be cold - this was really quite mysterious and something they must sort out they have the following a la carte restaurants - brazilian , bbq , steak house , mexican , gourmet , japanese , mediterranean , fish we ate in all of them and had mixed experiences throughout this was either due to poor service one night good the next , cold food one night great cooking the next - this was the overall experience and very frustrating the worst was the japanese the 5 course set meal was sushi , then cold tempura , then miso soup and then prawns , fish , beef  chicken with rice cooked on the hibachi grill followed by dessert at a neighbouring table the grill chef began to cook our main meal as we were eating the sushi when we were ready to eat the main 30 minutes later he had managed to murder all the food as it was waiting on the grill or it was cold on platesit i really do not think i 've ever been so cross in a restaurant ( i did not complain to him as it would not have changed anything ) we witnessed someone ruin perfectly good ingredients in front of our eyes and spoilt what should or could have been a very good meal - benihanas it was not drinks were always very slow in coming at meal times - except water - and the white wine is undrinkable - really we ordered a la carte chilean sauvignon which was about ?8 a bottle and worth the money - you would not drink rubbish wine at home so why when you 're on holiday regardless if its included pools  beachwe stayed by the two middle pools as they were quieter and more relaxing - easily got beds and umbrellas the pool adjacent to the beach was mobbed the beach was beautiful but again , during the day it looked like the d - day landings it was so busy swim up pool bars were great although the resort seemed to be packed with adults from canada who even though they were in their forties or above were so loud and raucous later in the day it was difficult to get near the bar , certainly not with children they all bring their own mugs ( which obviously manage to hold more beer than the plastic cups on offer ) and one even fell asleep on the bar at 4pm for over an hour having been there since about 10 i found myself being embarrassed for them there were so many it should be renamed punta canada ( i used to think americans were loud , but the canadians are right up there - ) entertainmentevening entertainment in the theatre was ok although i got fed up drinking drinks out of plastic cups understandable for around the pool , but why in the evening in the theatre only the reception bar had glasses lots of dance shows primarily but the children liked it all later on in the principe square out front , there is a karaoke bar , small casino , burger joint , disco and outside seating and a band only went once but was ok , great for younger people and night owls tripslots of trips to do we went on the caribbean festival which was fun on a boat and the snorkelling and swimming with sharks  stingrays a truly great trip , and fabulous fun , with dancing and entertainment on the boat a very professionally run trip , on a beautiful new catamaran with top facilities ( did not do anymore as we transferred to cayo levantodo - see below ) overallfacilities were great , public areas were immaculate and staff were very friendly but the service was very erratic and you are just as likely to have a great meal as a poor meal in any restaurant on any night subsequently , you really ca not take anyone?? review as gospel as it could change from table to table , in the same restaurant on the same night just try and be lucky for us , our conclusion was that we loved the dominican republic but this resort is just too big a beautiful place but lacks any feeling of intimacy , seclusion , exclusivity and good consistent service for people with teenagers i am sure they will love it but it?? not for us we have learnt a lot again this holiday , and even though we had a great time , we would choose a smaller resort next time the icing on the cakethe hotel had overbooked apparently , they do this often , especially this time of year they were advertising for volunteers to go to another property for a few nights as my wife wanted to see the humpback whales spawn , ( this happens every feb  march in samana bay ) and it was too far for a day trip with the kids , we decided to take up their offer of 3 nights in this area so after 3 days in punta cana , we packed , took 1 suitcase and left the others with guest services  took a 3 hour coach trip ( which was fascinating going thorugh the country and towns ) and a 30 minute catamaran to their brand new hotel on cayo levantado ( bacardi island ) suffice it to say , this was the best decision we have ever made on any holiday the hotel only has 196 bedrooms , our room over looked the bay and was enormous , the facilities are first glass , service excellent and we got to know everyone beautiful beaches , beautiful pools and restaurants and great staff i could go on for ages about this hotel , but just look it up for yourself we immediately prolonged our stay for another 2 nights they took us whale watching for free and that was fantastic watching them rise out of the water right next to you and the really unbelievable part about all of this they paid us $200 per night as we had moved so , 6 magical days later and $1000 better off , we returned for our final 6 nights back at punta cana if you are ever in gbp punta cana and you see this deal advertised take it without hesitation and you will email me to thank me for the advice ? 
huge does not begin to describe before deciding on this resort , i must have read a hundred reviews on this site a vast majority of the reviews gave this resort the big thumbs up so will mine we have been to punta cana 7 times staying mostly at the barcelo bavaro palace i mention this because of the size difference between the 2 places when people say the bahia principe is big , that 's an understatement this place is a city , maybe a city and suburb all to itself i am not into big places which is why i mentioned the palace no shuttles needed within the resort everything is a max 5 min walk not at the bahia principe the shuttles did run often , but you never really know where you will end up when you take one the only thing that made this resort managable was staying in ambar spend the extra if you have it and upgrade to the gold club that suburb i was talking about , it 's ambar you can walk to the beach , buffet , and a couple of the restaurants pools and bars along with the beach grill are all right there it has it 's own lobby area , where you can book golf , trips , water sports , ect it even has it 's own little shop it is adults only so if you are taking kids , and why would you want too , you ca not stay there food : all in all pretty good the ambar buffet was smaller but seemed to have a better variety of food for all meals at breakfast , you can get a mamosa or bloody mary when you walk in i do admit , the service could have been better , seemed to be understaffed and was hard to get drinks at the table not all the time but often enough we ate at the specialty restaurants finding the japanese and gourmet the best we did not rush to make reservations when we got there and generally did not have a problem changing things around as needed during the week i 'm not a fan of scheduling dinners but i guess alot of places are going that route and men , take the long pants you cannot eat at night , even the buffet , without long pants however , if you forgot them , they did offer room service all day , but the menu was mainly hamburgers and the like drinks : this is where this place blows the doors off the palace lower to mid level liquor available everywhere stoli on the rocks seemed to be the drink of the week for us after a couple of days , the bartenders remember you and have a drink ready to go , as long as there is not a line of people waiting champaign everywhere , mamajuana everywere , good scotch , good gin , forget the local stuff , they have real booze again , table service in the bars was a little slow they offered a drink of the day which was usually some fruity or chocolate thing all the bars closed at 11:00 pm rooms : i do not know anything about the rooms up front , but in ambar , outstanding big rooms , huge bathroom , jacuzzi bath tub and separate shower stall , marble floors , really nice the beds were comfortable and , get this , you can order different pillows depending on what you are used to everything from hard to feather pillows , did not find that out until the end the pillows in the room were a bit hard for me so i guess i should have taken the time to read all the propaganda in the room first thing and do not think you can open the balcony doors and get a nice breeze along with the a/c when you open the sliding doors , the a/c goes off until you close them so do not leave the doors open even a little or the room will be a sauna in no time get to know your housekeeper as well she was great about making sure you had enough supplies ( beer ) in your room the first day we stayed on the beach all day i took a small cooler on the beach for beer i asked my housekeeper if she could get me some presidente for the beach and before i knew it i had 20 cans of beer in my cooler i never had less then a six pack in my room the rest of the trip shuttles : yes they were all over the place but no they did not always take you where you wanted to go if you do not want to walk that much and you are staying in ambar , make sure your shuttle says ambar in the front otherwise you will ride all over the place and not get were you want to be there are two main entrances to the resort the punta cana side and the bavaro side all shuttle end at the bavaro side only the ambar shuttles go to the punta cana side that is where we checked in along with the gold club check in room and the casino is on that side too we did walk alot casino : really really small 6 tables , maybe 40 slots get there early if you want to play anything seats fill up fast drinks are not included there as the casino is separate from the resort beach : just as you would think , it 's huge plenty of places for sun , shade , or to hide away we saw 2 weddings on the beach and they do a great job of decorating for it people do walk around offering you excursions but a simple no thanks sends them on their way if you plan on spending the entire day on the beach and want shade , yes you will have to get up a little early and grab a spot but if you are on and off the beach any other times , you can always find a place to sit your tired bones if you can handle the size of the place then i highly recomend this resort it is a first class facility , with a few bug still needed to be worked out i 'll go back , maybe one more time 
believe what you read - both good and bad just got back from the gran bahia principe ( feb 2- 8) and here is the deal : in general : ? problems : most of the *problems* are a result of the resort being ??verbooked? this is pretty inexcusable and due to either incompetence or greed on the part of the resort we were traveling with two other parties and had made reservations/requests 9 months ago to have our rooms together ( two families with toddlers and their grandmother ) we were able to get in the same building , but on different floors out of 1,700 rooms , we could not get 3 rooms together despite several requests and greasing the front desk clerk $10 in fact , while we were there they were offering people $200 a day and/or free excursions for guests who were willing to relocate to another resort i?? not sure how the other resort ( s ) compare to this one as we did not want to chance moving all three parties the sense that i got was that most of the staff try to be friendly and helpful but they are just so overwhelmed that many/most requests just fall through the cracks whenever we needed something ( cribs for the babies , bell hops for luggage , more water or beer for the room etc ) we generally had to ask 3-4 different people and even then it was 50/50 whether or not you?? get it layout : the place is huge and somewhat confusing due to its ??win? the gran bahia principe has a ??avaro? and a ??unta cana? side which mirror each other and have separate lobbies , restaurants etc in addition , they??e recently added an adults - only section called ??mbar? which further confuses the newly arrived we checked in on the punta cana side but due to overbooking , were placed in a building on the ??avaro? no big deal as far as i can tell , the location was actually very close to the beach ? it just took us a couple of days to figure out the whole layout getting around : the resort is organized with the lobby/main buffet on one end and the beach/main pool on the other end there are trolleys ( mini trucks with passenger trailers in tow ) that operate throughout the day , but you can walk the entire distance in about 10-15 minutes as most people have said , the grounds are extremely well kept and clean to the point that you can?? help but wish that they would spend less on the grounds crew and more on things like guest services staff etc the beach and pool areas are very nice getting chairs/towels is no problem , although if you are traveling with children and want key areas with shade you need to get out there by 8 or so and reserve some chairs the staff , while overwhelmed , is mostly very friendly yes there is a language barrier and you should brush up on your spanish , but generally they are friendly ( especially the buffet staff with children ? they were super nice to our toddlers ) let?? face it ? you??e going there for sun and warmth and that?? what you??e going to get even the couple of days where it rained , it?? usually just a short rain shower ( or several ) and then back to blue skies during our stay it was in the low 80?? during the day and low 70?? at night generally you didn?? have to wait long to get a drink pretty much everywhere there are bars in the lobby , a couple by the pool , at the pool snack bar and in the theatre if there is an event going on there you can also get alcoholic drinks in the main buffet the busiest bar seems to be pool bar , and often it was quicker to duck into the one in the snack bar close by the lobby is huge and a great place to hang out before or after meals or just to have coffee or a drink at night as many have noted , the food is really not that good the main buffet is in the lobby and has pretty much the same thing for breakfast and lunch and a different theme every night for dinner there is a pretty wide selection and you can *generally* find something to fill you up , but you won?? find yourself looking forward to meal times you??l find that breakfast is your favorite meal as it?? hard to screw up an omelet or a bowl of cereal or a pancake etc many people go to the snack bar near the pool/beach for lunch , which is also a buffet and has the same mediocre stuff every day ( chicken , french fries , hot dogs , hamburgers , cold cuts , small pasta bar and some fruit ) i felt guilty for letting so much food go to waste , but you have to get/try about 10 things to find the one or two that are actually edible ala carte restaurants scheduling your 3 meals at the ala carte restaurants is a nightmare from the minute the guest services office is open it is swamped with people trying to make a reservation you??l most likely not get to eat at the time you want or at the restaurants that you want , which is unfortunate as the food in the two restaurants that we were able to get into ( italian and french ) were much better than the buffet certainly not the same as ??ine dining? in the states , but pretty good if you have a toddler that requires a nap , try not to get a room on the ground floor the maids always come in the afternoon and are very noisy ? yelling at each other and perpetually moving furniture around in the rooms above you asking them to try to be quiet or to come back later will not get you very far in addition , you??l hear the trolleys , vans and scooters outside of your room for the better part of the day and night traveling with two other parties it was interesting to see the difference in maid service we left money out ( $2- $5) every day and would occasionally ask for extra water or more beer for the mini bar in the room generally we didn?? find much of a correlation between leaving a tip and getting any special treatment usually we wouldn?? get what we requested and one day we came home to find that the maid had taken all of our old towels ( which we had left hanging which means ??on?? take? and had not left us any new ones after asking 2-3 times for some towels i had to locate a maid cart and ??orrow? my sister and brother in law on the other hand were getting extra beer and water , bubble baths drawn with flower petals , balloons in the room etc in sum , it really comes down to who you get for a maid and how much they want to take care of you helpful hints? bring an insulated mug this tip absolutely saved my vacation otherwise , all your drinks ( alcoholic or otherwise ) come in thimble size plastic cups which you can drink while you??e waiting for your next drink it will also keep your drink cold while you hang on the beach or by the pool ask for the room safe when you check in ( about $25 for the week ) we were not asked if we wanted one when we checked in and had to go back the next day and wait in the considerable check - in line to get one it is simple to use and good peace of mind for your valuables bring $25- $50 in singles for tips for waiters , bartenders and maids they are generally not expected and won?? get you much if any special treatment , but they are appreciated spend time early on to walk the entire complex and figure out the layout this will make the rest of your stay more enjoyable watch out for the airport vultures they will accost you as you??e leaving the airport and insist on carrying your luggage , even though your trip representative ( vip or whoever ) is waiting just a few steps away from them feel free to use them if you have a lot of luggage and need a hand , but mostly they are just trying to extort some coin from you similarly , if you don?? like being hounded watch out for the vendors on the inside of the ??illage square? 
stole my camera this was an awful experience staying at this hotel the first day there and they stole my camera inside my room , seeing that the safe was not ready for 24 hours , they asked us to come back in the morning for the safe in the morning left my camera to go and register the key and wow went back to the room the cleaning lady had already folded all our clothes neatly and room was clean however the camera was gone but the battery was still being recharged it was a canon digital camera made a complain and it took them 7 days to answer me back sayign that it is not their fault if you do not want to get your stuff looked through or stolen do not stay at this resort the service was awful the dinner was never ready the restaurants are always booked in 7 days could not get anything else except chinese 1 night pillows in the room are so skinny asked for more pillows got them the 2nd day because my husband went to pick them up kids club they do the same dance over and over that week , my firend stayed 2 weeks and they repeated the same dance and activity for the kids even the kids thought it was boring the kids club in total words for the price you could get better elsewhere 
love at first sight my boyfriend and i decided it was time to take our first trip together and chose punta cana as the place to go after talking to a friend of our travel agents we settled on the bahia principe she gave it a 10/10 and promised us we would love it for our first time out of canada we booked through air transat so we were in the royal golden section of the resort which is right by the beach we were a 20 ft walk from our large pool which connects to the huge strip of beach that is just gorgeous our transat rep was amazing , she helped us book our a la cartes and our activities outside the resort we wanted to do we booked the shopping tour ( which we loved ) , the marinariam ( which was the most fun ) and a trip to manati park to swim with the dolphins it was this last activity where i got to fulfill a dream of geting up close and personal with a dolphin all of our activities were amazing and went off without a hitch the resort is large , spacious and just a beautiful place to be they have shuttle buses ( which personally i never smelt anything bad as some ppl on here claim ) that take you throughout the resort and we went on all of them many times just to see all the beauty this resort had to offer the food was great , we never had to much problem with temperature of the food , all i know is there was a large variety of foods and the wait staff was very helpful *though we only speak english and clearly were in teh minority* we had four a la cartes and i highly reccommend the seafood and the italian ( though the mexican and the steak house are great choices as well ) we had this guy john serve us at the main lobby bar and the pool bar and let me tell you - this guy made our trip he was always singing and laughing and talking to everyone his english was great , and he made us feel right at home if you ever see him , you will fall in love with him and want to take him home with you our room was on the first floor villa 21 and we had one cockroach once on a night it rained particulary hard , other then that we did not see one bug our entire trip so i am not sure why other ppl on here on the first floor complained of it if you want to know anything else contact me , cause i will boast about this resort forever 
loved the whole experience we stayed at the gran bahia principe punta cana from 1/19 - 2/2/08 and were very impressed with the whole resort the people were wonderful , very helpful the food was very good ( we have stayed at 3 other resorts on punta cana , thought they were good , but this was by far the best ) we loved the choices of specialty restaurants it was difficult getting booked for an evening , unless you planned ahead ( the first day you arrive ) this was not on our list of things to do yet , so we missed out on a few however , since we had 2 weeks it worked out the food and service was excellent the buffets were great - so many choices and such a variety each and every time we were there the staff was so helpful - the grounds are beautiful , and they were being worked on constantly very appreciated and noticed by us the pools were beautiful , and to have them as well as the beach was a great bonus my husband loved the drinks - he would have liked to have a minibar in our room with alcohol ( the punta cana side ) , but he did not lack for thirst quenchers we needed some things in our room a couple of times , and i called the front desk - we were provided with our needs almost immediately , with a follow - up call to make certain we got what we needed our biggest thumbs down was the noise in our complex the rooms apparently were not insulated for noise we were on the 1st floor , and we heard every little move , every step , shower running , etc if the people were having a late night out , it of course disturbed us during our sleep we retire early , cannot fault those who like night life , but it would have been nice not to have been awakened each night by the noise above us our last 2 nights there were especially bad - there were some very unruly young men and they did not go to bed until early morning hours it sounded like they were tearing up the complex you have that any place , we just really noticed that there was no noise barrier i had a terrific massage at poolside this cost extra , but it was worth it overall , we can hardly wait to return for another wonderful vacation bring on the hot sunshine , warm breezes and cool shade - that and the surroundings of a beautiful resort make it a dream to look forward to 
we came back on the 31st jan after a 2 week stay , and we were more than ready to firstly , they were massively overbooked ( how does this happen ) however , this is not an unusual occurence evidently our first night then , was spent in a different hotel altogether they said they would pick us up at 12, to take us to the bahia they arrived at 2 it took over 3 hours to go 20 miles , because the bus was breaking down they said it wasnt , we found out later , the hotel had told the driver to go slow because the rooms werent ready for us that was the start of the lies , it went down hill for the rest of the 2 weeks the restaurants are too full , you cant book there lies we promise to fumigate your room  ( as we had been so badly bitten , the doctor insisted on it ) lies after much complaining and arguing with the horrible man in charge on reception , they brought us a can of fly spray to our room the food in the buffet was constantly cold , and all the meats either underdone , or inedible they were so tough the speciality restaurants were the best , if not fantastic , i would say the gourmet and the meditteranean were the best we asked if we could have a bottle of tonic water , to take to the room ,  no sir , it is not allowed what funny , we watched while 3 lovely looking young canadian girls were given three the beach is lovely away from the hotel it was like an 18/30 holiday every day the main lagoon style pools , were ok but much too busy you were almost laying on top of each other the diamond pool , ( to which we had been upgraded as an apology ) was nothing special just full of loud mouthed swearing drunks , dropping their swimming trunks , regardless of the fact that there were children there too the girl whos job it is , to get rid of the people who shouldnt be there , said nothing at all to these yobs , but we watched whils twice she asked young couples with a baby to leave , even though there were on both occasions , about 30 free beds just because they were wearing the wrong coloured band what a joke the main lobby bar was the only one that anyone over 30 wanted to use , and it was so boring it shuts at 11, and then they hovver round you waiting for you to give them your glass if you dont , they take it from you , and pour it in to aplastic cup , then all the lights are switched off do not pay for an upgrade its the biggest rip off ever the cleaners were lovely ( the poorest paid usually are ) the bar staff were rude , and arrogant , with the exeption of a couple of the girls the waiters were ok but slow to bring your drinks , if you got them at all however they were so quick to take your plates away , that twice they whipped mine from under my nose , and i was still eating the reception staff , and the customer service staff , are among the rudest i have ever come accross anywhere in the world and dont bother asking for anything , because theyll promise , but you wont get it they are a dreadful bunch of people , and i cant think of one of them that i would keep in my employ , if i wanted to give a good impression there is a kids club , but we saw no evidence of anything going on for the kids what ever the meals as i said , were very second rate , breakfast was terrible scrambled eggs that were slimy , and cold no tomatoes , unless you went to the bbq on the beach , toasters that dont work , cold coffee every morning , etc etc the grounds are fantastic beautifully kept , and very pretty the train service ( which you cant manage without ) is brilliant i wouldnt go back to this hotel , if i won it in a prize draw no disrespect whatever to the canadians ( we made friends with quite a few ) but the hotel , is far more friendly towards them , than to us brits all in all , it was a terrible let down i wouldnt recommend it to anyone , and if you are booked to go well , id say change your booking , and go somewhere else , youll be very disappointed if you dont 
24 hours was too long we were booked to stay at the grand bahia principe jan 17-25, 2008 we would like to start off by saying that this is not our first time at an all inclusive and we have been travelling many years from hawaii , mexico , cuba , etc and have not had a bad experience until this year to start off we read the reviews daily on the grand bahia and ignored the negatives , bad mistake we had requested as close to the ocean as possible with our travel agent as well as emailing the resort when we booked in we soon realized that we had been placed into the premier section after informing the front desk attendant we had requested close to the beach , we were told they were overbooked and that was the only room available so after telling him for an hour that i was not taking that section , all of a sudden a room became available so our holiday starts tried to book our a la cartes immediately , to no avail unless you want to eat at 9:00 and not the restaurants we requested as they were full so off to the beach the beach was overcrowded , but it was a beach went to find food , my husband bit into the burger to find it blood red and not even slightly cooked went to go back to the room , room keys are not working now so back we went , all the way back to the front desk to get new keys all the way back to our room and wanted to have a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath nope , no luck the plug does not work and will not hold water frustrated and mad go for supper and all we heard was a young baby crying , kids spilling their drinks and parents yelling at the kids we had to ask three times for a simple diet coke , and still never received it we found staff to be outright rude and demanding in tips not our idea of a holiday all of this in a matter of four hours next morning we accept the bumping and move to the excellence now the holiday started we were nothing but impressed by the excellence they had been told what a horrible start to our holiday and instantly upgraded us to the oceanview suite this resort is nothing but a1 in customer service , food and cleanliness the could teach the staff at grand bahia many things about customer service for more information on the excellence , please see our post on there 
great beach just got back jan 13/08this is our 2nd stay at a bahia property we had such a good time at their mexican resort we thought we would try one in the d food : still very good , a la carte restaurants very goodbeach : as wonderful as everyone said it would be , soft sand , lots of palapas[beach umbrellas] , and very long , not a lot of topless women so no one should really be offended service : not bad , there is a language barrier , when they do finally understand what you want there is no problem resort : diamond club members , when you get off the bus , turn right and go down the hallway to the last room , this is your check in we had trouble finding this and almost missed out on the ala carte restaurants from reading other reviews we thought this resort would be huge not so , from the front desk to the beach was only about an 8 minute walk , nothing to complain about though many did you can always take the tram which comes by every 2 minutes or so rooms : large and cool , beds a little firm , shower water pressure is very strong tipping : always , gets you better service and more smiles , especially at the bars and does not really cost that much more water : refreshing with lots of waves if you go out a little bit not much to see for snorkling 
the walmart of all inclusives stayed at this resort december 20-27, 2007 we are from toronto , family of 3 with a 9 year old boy have mostly stayed at paradisus resorts in cuba and mexico let me start by saying that for the majority of americans and canadians this resort would be fine for our family it was too big and impersonal for our liking we also had a bad start as flight delayed 4 hrs got into the hotel at 2 or 3 in the a preferred paradisus resorts which are closer to 5 star in quality of food and amenities we were in building 37, third floor , about two buildings away from the lobby ate at four restos : french/gourmet , seafood , italian and japanese pros : short ride from airport (30mins ) , fantastic beach ( soft sand  turquoise water , clean good size rooms , good air conditioning and block out drapes , baked goods such as sugared donuts and corn bread , some fish , pizza  hamburgers ok at beach grill , roast turkey at xmas , scrambled eggs if cooked fresh , some desserts , no probs with fridge not being stocked and when i phoned down for more pillows , beer and water it came in about 20 mins ( left small tip for maid most days ) , no prob finding a beach chair at any time but might have to drag one to where you want to becons : resort is so huge you need to take a shuttle do go from one end of the resort to the other , runs frequently but who needs the hassle no coffee at the dinner buffet and no coke at the morning buffet , no hair conditioner , no clock in the room , most food is fried in palm oil , grilled does not mean grilled its fried on a flat grill , have to ask the waiter if you like your coffee hot as their carafes they run around with do not hold the heat , the food is good if you like applebees or kelseys at the best ( which for about 80% of north americans is fine ) , first of all it is a virtual porkfest ( slim pickings if you are jewish ) and gross if you do not like pork e one selection was called pig pizza , the a la cartes are mediocore at best ( like most of the all inclusives they try hard but they could do better ) , lobster is plentiful but the small carribbean ones which are mostly over cooked and dry , the filet was ok for applebees , japanese set up is better at other resorts we 've been to ( miso soup was vegetable soup ) , omelets are all ingredients mixed together and not folded over , lack of flora and fauna ( not so many trees and the odd lizard running around , no coral nearby for snorkeling , no outside jacuzzi 's hot pools , occasional whiff of sewage in the air when standing on balconyto upgrade or not to upgrade we originally were going to upgrade and backed off when we felt it really was not worth it for us if you want to be nearby the beach ( no guarantee of view and it is not oceanfront , only side view ) then you should upgrade , you may also get into a two story unit ( most of the complex has 3 story units ) , but remember if you are by the beach you have to take a shuttle all the time to access the main area ( buffett , lobby , nightly entertainment and shopping square ) and the beach area is noisy , the rooms are all the same size so no benefit there , private pool area is a joke as it it right beside the quieter resort pool and had the same number of people , extra a la carte ( no big deal you can usually negotiate extra a la cartes without upgrading ) , if you like to have your own private lounge and internet cafe so you feel like a special person go for it , oh and you also get room service ( which is the only thing we regretted as other 5 stars such as the paradisus chain , room service is standard ) tips : stay away from manati park , its like a third world zoo with more vendors and peddlars than animals variety of animals was sparse and boringtry and use a little spanish ( polite and useful ) bring small bills for tips , conditioner , moisturizer and bug spraycan buy all of this stuff and more at the lobby store so no big deal if you forgetbox of pringles (4$ and change ) , pack of marlboro lights (5$ and change ) when at guest services ask for extra a la cartes ( get them to check cancellations ) drinks better if ask for better brands and throw in the odd tip , hang out at the quieter resort pool instead of the main over crowded and noisy onedo not ask for third floor if you do not like climbing stairs or elderlywhen negotiating late check out be firm and creative ( we got free checkout till 3p and paid $60 00 to stay until 6:00 p ( well worth it ) no smoking in restaurants except outdoor beach grillsprobably want rooms closer to main area if elderly or kids otherwise shuttling all the timetry to get rooms away from the main shuttle lines ( they go by every 5 mins and emit exhaust fumes ) resort is divided into two mirror images ( bavaro a  punta cana ) separated by main shuttle line with their own separate lobbys and restaurantsso paris and gourmet restaurants  both japanese restos are mirror images that share the same kitchens and offer the same foodits hard to say which a la carte is best due to personal preference ( you may like seafood better than filet but may find both at both the seafood and french/gourmet ) brasilian resto is outside and prone to bugs 
beach lovers ' paradise we stayed at the gran bahia principe punta cana which is a twin property of the bavaro and shares most of the same facilities there is no difference between the two our group of seven had two sets of parents and three young adults (20+ ) we chose this facility based on trip advisor reviews , and we were not dissapointed for the most part the property is huge but is exceptionally well - laid out so you do not have the sense of being crowded the main buffet has many selections with familiar offerings and local recipies you will find something that you 'll like and also find other things that you may not care for it seems that most of the food is sourced locally , and generally the beef is tough but the chicken and pork were very good the seafood is variable with the lobster being mushy the good news is that no one had any stomach upsets and we all ate well the los olas lunch buffets near the beach are highly recommended we also ate at three specialty restaurants - japanese , brasilian and meditteranean the japanese was a poor rendition of the real thing but had good presentation but mediocre results the brasilian was ok , but the service was very uneven the mediterranean was very nice but the portions ( except the prime rib ) were small the rooms are excellent with good air - conditioning and superior appointments the villas are very quiet and our neighbours were never heard even though all units were occupied the room safe is $32 for the week and is highly recommended we were situated by the main pool which was fine for us none of the villas are poorly located in my opinion we love to play and looked forward to the sailing , tennis and kayaking so were a lot of other people be warned that the common recreational facilities are by reservation and book up very quickly you have to be there first thing to have a chance at reserving for the next day ( or two days ahead for boats ) it is advisable to pay $20 for a week 's insurance as the waters are quite shallow our hobie wave catamaran hit rocks on several occasions the three tennis courts have seen better days but served our purpose adequately the beach and pools are unbeatable lots of room and no need to rush down to reserve a place everyone can enjoy shade if they want and the beach chairs seem endless the pools feature lots of child - friendly areas the beach vendors do not hassle you the drinks in this all - inclusive resort are good with friendly service they will provide a decent shot if encouraged to do so otherwise , you will enjoy a sweet , fruity concoction which wo not lead to inebriation the wine with dinner is spanish and very light - bodied with less than 10% alcohol it probably is a second squeezing as it lacks character and body the rum is the drink here but the beer is good as well do not expect a great gt the nightlife is varied and starts with a show at 9:45pm the michael jackson show was entertaining and the others were spirited and colourful most lasted 45 minutes and had good dancing as the core element other entertainment consisted of a karaoke bar , disco and casino which came to life later there was also entertainment in the plaza that varied nightly the grounds are kept in outstanding condition and service was always friendly and helpful provide a few tips to those who offer superior service and you 'll get even better service there are numerous excursions in the local area , but we preferred to do the beach thing all in all it was an enjoyable holiday that was worth the expense 
paid for 5 star , received about a 1/2 star we arrived on nov 28th , a beautiful sunset , expecting the most becausewe were there for a wedding went to the front desk , nope , go to the golden desk , found it with minimal difficulty , but found it strange that it is tucked away the first morning , i attended the orientation briefing and proceeded immediately after to get my reservations for the 4 restaurants i got the key for the safe , but had to track down a maintenance person to put in fresh batteries , after about 20 minutes , he tells me that only the 1, 2, and 3 numbers on the safe work , 6-9 do not we went with 3321 as a code , no biggie so , the first day came and went , minimal difficulty ( trust me ) , merelymissing artwork on the wall of our room , and a broken shower head then it started to fall apart on the second day we went to our first reservation and they did not have us on the list despite a receipt withmy name on it they managed to fit us in with almost 20 empty tables that night , we returned to the room , set the wakeup alarm , andchecked to see no new refreshments in the fridge the air conditioningbroke during the night and we realized we needed a remote the third morning , i traveled (853 metres , according to my gps ) to thegolden desk , asked for a remote , asked for the a/c to be fixed , and asked for a phone to be fixed we had a day at catalina island and returned to find that the phone did not work again we soon learned that the cleaning lady was leaving the rear door to our room unlocked every day there was construction in the amber area and people could have walked into our room and taken our unlocked items easily so , we had a daily inspection of our rear door for the rest of the week we also found that the soap dish in our shower mysteriously disappeared 'the fourth morning was supposed to be the wedding reception , but the bride was not up to it we decided to try and cancel our restaurant reservations for the 6th night and get a reservation for this night , as well as complain the phone was still not working they pulled up our room and found that we had no reservations even though we had booked them , and we had receipts with our name on it essentially theytold us we were not booked and there was no room in the restaurants , we would have to return daily to get a canceled reservation so be it ,10 minutes to travel to the lobby area and get something better than the buffet food that night , the phone still did not work the fifth day , i made my way to the reception again to complain about the phone they told me that they were going to move us finally well , that was not exactly possible we had our daily outing to attend again , wishing we had some room service so that we did not have to run into the buffet at 7 am , fill our ziplocs up with food and run to catch our bus ten minutes later on top of this , we had the wedding and all the festivities the next day so we could not afford the hours it would take to pack up , move , and unpack they assured us that the external phone company was coming to fix our lines the sixth day , wedding day returned home , and found drinks were miraculously restocked , no air conditioning possibly because the sensor on the rear door shorted and caught fire ( i have pictures ) , ourtoilet exploded ( my girlfriend thought i had put the jets on in the bathtub without any water in the tub ) , and to top it all off , you guessed it , no phone the seventh day , we packed our things and vacated the room at lunch essentially , you are supposed to call for the busboy service , but thiswas impossible for us we carried our bags to the tram , threw them on , climbed off and carried our bags to the lobby i tossed them down in front of the desk to the amazement of the employees who asked why we did not call for the busboy i did not even comment we cleared out without issue believe it or not , but we did pass by about 20 or so employees on our trip inbound to the lobby without any offer of assistance so , paid for 24 hour room service , had no phone , therefore could not access it had to tram it in and out a number of times to complain , toilet exploded , air conditioning broke twice , missing artwork , rear door unlocked every day , lost reservations despite our names on them ( i had no problem going to the restaurants as mr sawatsky , mr gibson , and mr i ca not even spell it , three times ) , 3 numbers workingon the safe , in a construction area ( during the day , we were not there so did not mind the noise in our absence ) , and not to mention the cat calls towards my girlfriend , it was a nice touch but believe it or not , the beach was awesome and really clean with a great surf , there is a beautiful shipwreck about a mile offshore , and mimosa 's you ca not go wrong with those comments , criticisms , critiques , or questions are welcome i did everything that my resort representative asked of me and made sure that i documented everything that happened to us oh , and on our return home , the doors to plane froze shut , it was a beautiful ending to the worst resort experience of my life 
great time at gran bahia we had a great vacation at the gran bahia principe in early december the resort was gorgeous beautiful landscaping great pools and beach , relaxing open lobby for drinks at night the staff was very friendly and helpful we had a wonderful time relaxing at this great resort the beach/water was beautiful , although we spent more time enjoying the pools and swim - up bars rooms were clean , bathrooms were nice with a large tub complete with jets we mostly ate at the buffet because we did not want to have to bother with reservations or going to dinner at a certain time we did eat at the seafood restaurant one night and enjoyed the dinner ( the calamari to start was great and we both had lobster enchiladas ) overall , we had a great vacation and would return to this resort 
nice resort 31/2 stars we just returned from a week vacation , december 16 to 23, 2007 we chose this hotel because it offers facilities for handicapped traveler and is targeted to families my boyfriend and i were traveling with my mom ( age 72) huge ( more than 1600 rooms ) divided in small sections lots of people especially in the main sections we stayed in the club premier section because they were no available handicapped rooms ( even if we reserved one with travel agent ) after an hour running around to make sure the rooms were ok ( the give stairs access to a low mobility person ) , we agreed to stay in the club premier section which was the best compromise there are ramps almost everywhere but a lot of walking in involved even if there is a very efficient system of trolly trains service was ok since there is a lot of people , there deal with volume rather than quality the first night at the bbq restaurant , the staff was continuously coming to the table to pour some wine it was anowing food and wine ( which tastes like vinegar ) were ok shrimps were good and beer too the employees work a lot of hours for small money the appreciate tip rooms were very clean and so is the resort my mom had a hair styling and she was happy with it as for the gym , very smal for the size of the resort 
es bahia principe just returned this morning from a great week with my boyfriend at bahia principe their theme song is still stuck in my head this is my bf 's 3rd time at an all - inclusive and my 2nd so i now have one previous experience to compare to considering just the resort itself , bahia principe was much better than breezes jibacoa in cuba , which i would now re - rate as 3 out of 5 stars i do have a lot to say so please bare with me we booked online through sunwing vacations my impression of sunwing is not that great after this trip the beginning and end of the trip was horrible because neither the travel agent nor sunwing told us when we booked the trip that santo domingo , where we landed , is a 3+ hours drive to punta cana beware of this when we complained to our sunwing rep at the resort , he told us that it should have been the travel agent 's responsibility anyway , we probably ended up travelling 8 hours total from the airport to the resort and back returning to santo domingo was not too bad because it was afternoon and there were things to see and businesses were open but on the way there , we landed in the evening around 8:30pm and so the 4- hour drive was in complete darkness as the streets were pitch black our guide did not seem friendly and was clear that he did not like speaking english he said 2 hours to santo domingo and kept quiet pretty much the rest of the trip , so after 2 hours we were not sure where he was taking us anyway , it was a horrible start to a vacation in general : imo , punta cana is a place to go for sun , beach , and relaxing it is not your best choice for sightseeing in contrast , cuba ( havana ) had plenty of culture and sightseeing bahia principe is a big resort like previous reviews have mentioned , the trains that take you around are efficient and i never had to wait more than a few minutes room : we were upgraded for free to the club premier which is as far as it gets from the beach , but quite close to the central area of the resort with the lobby and pueblo principe perks included our own buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner ( smaller than the main buffet ) , our own pool with swim - up bar , and our own snack bar which had different and better food than any other snack bar because we were on the 2nd floor , we had no bug and ant problems our friends on the ground floor did have bugs in their room everything in the room was clean and quite well - kept bedsheets , bathroom and shower were all clean and white but i do agree with a previous review that for some reason , they seemed to ignore the bathroom mirror the shower had no curtain but a piece of glass that covers only half the tub and does not slide - this caused a slight flooding in the bathroom because no matter how careful i was , water would always spray all over the floor amenities included toiletries , hair dryer , mini - bar , coffee , a big umbrella ( which came into good use on our first day ) there was no iron or ironing board the safe is $32 us for the week but a definite must - have our tv cable was broken and ripped when we arrived but a quick call and it was fixed promptly there were a few good english channels on tv nice sitting area and balcony , though our balcony view was barren land because we were on the edge of the resort unlike a previous review that said $2 a day was not enough , we tipped $2 us per day and everyday our maid decorated the bathroom with flowers and made us towel animals service : top - notch everyone was so polite and did everything with a smile reception , guest services , servers , bartenders , housekeeping , everyone i can remember tried to make our experience enjoyable a simple hola and smile from you will always be followed with an hola and smile my only negative experience was in the club premier lobby the man at the reception charged me incorrectly for my safe rental when i returned to point it out to him , he was not apologetic and returned my money with an angry demeanor and without a word buffet  a la carte : keep in mind you are in the dominican republic they do not get the food we get fresh in canada or in whatever country you 're from considering that , i found their food to be decent - definitely better than edible , which was my description for the food at breezes jibacoa in cuba the buffet is quite repetitive but the made - to - order omelettes at breakfast , made - to - order pastas at lunch , and dessert waffles at dinner were always delicious you 'll find your favourite dishes for the week we went to 4 a la cartes ( instead of 3 because we were upgraded ) - le gourmet ( punta cana side ) , japanese ( bavaro side ) , bbq ( at beach outdoors ) , seafood ( close to beach ) le gourmet was successfully french - styled but again it is food in the dr , so my filet mignon was more like a rib eye and the souffle was really a brownie however the presentation was beautiful i was not as impressed with the japanese as many others seemed to be in these reviews there was no teppanyaki show - he simply cooked the food in front of us with some banging of his tools and the grill everything was dry and overcooked except the shrimp which was fabulous deep fried ice cream was ok do not go to bbq this is nothing more than buffet with a few bbq features - which you might find at regular lunch or dinner buffet anyway seafood was my favourite of the 4 there was an appetizer buffet which had an excellent selection my boyfriend had a 1/2 lobster for his entr?e , which actually had some texture ( unlike the mushy lobster in the paella ) , and i had some decent salmon filets public areas : the lobbys of both the bavaro and punta cana sides were beautiful there is plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy a drink and lots of lounge chairs too where i saw many ppl take naps the gardens and grounds are so well - kept and well - groomed i think they cover every detail of cleanliness that you can think of - i saw workers waxing the marble floor in the lobby , polishing railings , cleaning chair cushions , scrubbing beach chairs i was very impressed with this pueblo principe : this little town has something for everybody plenty of shops for beach stuff , cigar and alcohol , jewellery , casino ( penny , nickel , quarter slots , some table games and 1 texas holdem table ) , pool tables , internet , piano/karaoke bar , disco (12-2am ) , nighttime burger joint (10pm -6/7am ) , and vendors - hahah these guys are good if you really do not want to talk to them , just politely say no and walk away one guy tried every trick in the book to try to get my boyfriend to buy some jewellery for me and my boyfriend was trying to be polite and not walk away he said the original price was $105 but would give it to us for $50 - we ended up talking him down to $18 but we still did not buy it because we did not think it would be real larimar from a vendor like that it was good entertainment though hahah all food and drink is included except for casino poolsthe water is very clear all the time of course there will be some dirt and sand with all the ppl that go in and out there are missing tiles here and there and maintenance of the pool physically is so - so there are always plenty of pool chairs the big fountain and the bridges at the beach pool add a nice touch the club premier pool was a nice perk for the free upgrade because it was much quieter than the main pools and has a swim - up bar 
this bahia principe not the same as mexico we stayed from dec 10 - 17th the first 2 days that tropical storm olga was going thru nothing too bad except heavy rain and winds unfortuntately there were fatalities elsewhere in the country and my family was worried for us while we were away i found the food so - so the same stuff over and over the mexican and italian restaurants were good tho we left $2 in our room everyday for our maid but i guess thats considered cheap we got a glimpse of our maid cleaning the room next door and they got flowers and towels formed into swans i guess it takes a fiver nowadays to get the little extras that you take for granted in mexico i had to take a trip to the medical ctr and be warned that they charge $90us for a consultation i made it perfectly clear i did not want or need a consultation and only needed to rent some equipment to help me get around cause i hurt my leg so for $10 a day i rented the equipment and that was fine i spoke with some one else in line and they spent $200 us by the time they had a consultation and got some cream for the bites on their legs they have good prizes if you win at the dart games a little bottle of rum or a teeshirt the activity team do try but its hard to understand their english i 've stayed at the bahia principe in the mayian riveria and was a bit disappointed that this one in dominican is not to the same standard i found you had to tip the bar staff to get any kind of feedback it was so obvious who tipped and who did not the way some guests got treated i 've got nothing against tipping and i certainly do it but not for every single drink its like the staff have a short memory unless you 've got a bill in your hand everytime the lobby was a great grand place to relax and play cards or read or whatever there are definately certain places in the hotel that are off limits to some without the upgrades i think they should advertise this better at the entrance of some pools so there is no misunderstandings there were mosquitos out this is my 5th trip to d and i 've never been bitten so much not sure if its the time of year or not anyway have a great time but do not expect this to be a true 5 star because its not its got a great beach and lobby but the rooms have bad workmanship like the tiling being off centre etc little things but never noticed stuff like this before while i 've been soaking in the tub at other resorts also the mirror was very dirty and had not been cleaned in ages do not think i 'll be going back probably head back to mexico where they know how to treat you right even if you do not tip every single time 
enjoyed the visit this was our 2nd visit to the dr in a 12 month period , and the first at this resort without repeating what others have written here , i will give the following scores out of 5 rooms - 4 5 out of 5grounds 5 out of 5entertainment -4 5 out of 5beach 5 out of 5staff 5 out of 5pools 4 5 out of 5- they are beautiful , but for some reason the water temp is a little too cool i also wish they would stay open past 6pm ( at least 1 of them ) value for money 4 5 out of 5food - - this is the one area that disappointed , and i am comparing this specifically to the iberostar chain if you read carefully the other posts many will say that if you ca not find something you like at the buffet , then you must be too fussy i will say i am not fussy , and i can and do eat many varieties of food the problem was not whether or not i could find something i would like - - - i could the problem was the quality of the food - - it reminded me of those all you can eat cheap buffets with names like country kitchen or like food in university residences the variety was there - - the quality was not quite frankly a ponderosa steakhouse buffet is just as good a pasta bar and omelette bar is nice , but it does not override the previous concerns just 2 comparison points to illustrate this cheese selection -3 varieties at bahia the iberostar had a minimum of 8 desserts - most at bahia were of a decidely low quality standard - - jello based , cheap cakes etc nothing of substantial quality i would recommend they add a drink station so you can get your own soft drink , beer or similar the waiters were relatively slow to come over and offer wine , soft drink etc plus strangely enough getting a coffee ( other than at breakfast ) was not really possible apparently the coffee comes from the bar area how much easier would it be if they just had a coffee station the 3 a la cartes we visited were the brazilian , french and japanese they were a nice change from the buffet , but again quality was not the best for example a ginger cake at the japanese was actually a cupcake the brazilian desserts were again unremarkable funnily enough on the first day we were told reservations were impossible for the steakhouse - - the entire week was unavailable would i recommend - - yes , with the one caveat about the food would i go back - no , but that is only because i am not a repeat visitor to any resort i like to try new resort each time 
no wedding there i was so disappointed with my stay at the gran bahia that i would strongly advise any travellers considering it to think again because me and my husband decided to get married in the dominican i did research for 13 months before the wedding , read the reviews and made sure we were 110% ready and organized when we got there unfortunately my organization and thoroughness did nothing when we arrived at the bahia we were blown away by the sheer size of this resort it is huge we had a bottle of rum , and a fruit basket along with 2 t - shirts and 2 ball caps waiting for us in the room as a wedding present from the resort as we started to meet up with the 39 other people that joined us we all took tours of each others rooms me and my husband had the smallest room out of the whole party ( not a big deal considering your never in your room ) but you would think that the bride and groom would get a little more we then noticed that the air - conditioning was not working after speaking to the front desk they said it was the whole resort we had friends in another section of the resort who had ac upon arrival so why would they lie after 2 days of no air conditioning a girl that came with us with her 15 month old baby called the front desk and told them she had a baby in the room , when is the ac going to be fixed literally 3 minutes later we all had ac that was very strange we received a letter from the wedding coordinator janette telling us to meet her at 10:30 on the sunday well the wedding was set for the next day at 2pm we went on sunday to meet janette , and we ended up with a lady named mage janette was to busy planning other weddings mage was very nice , great english and just genuinely sweet the first thing we were told was that our ceremony was going to be moved from 2pm to noon we said no , we had reserved the 2pm time 13 months ago mage ran to confirm and we got a 3pm time instead we picked everything we wanted , 4 bouquets , 4 boutonni?res ( which was a separate charge ) , a square cake , a projector , a photographer , arranged to have place cards at the table stating where the family would sit etc? br/>the day of the wedding myself and my 3 bridesmaids were getting our hair done at the spa i was told by mage that a bus would come pick us up at our room?? t 11:20 the bus never showed we had to scramble down to the spa to make sure we got there on time ok so no problems ramona who did our hair is fabulous i highly recommend her when it was time to do the ceremony mage came to the door with a guy named danny to deliver our bouquets they were short a bouquet they finished delivering the boutonni?res to the guys , and she said we will get it fixed by now it is 3pm 35 minutes later mage and danny come back with a ??ake shift? bouquet that did not match the others ok i am thinking , no worries i am getting married today i then find out that the boutonni?res are too heavy for the guy?? shirts why did no one mention that to us 'finally on our way to the ceremony , our poor guests sitting in the heat waiting for over an hour for the ceremony to start the driver took us girls the back way , through sprinklers and driving like a mad man we all almost fell out of the cart and we all got sprayed by the sprinklers we had asked many times that ??ow renewal? not be mentioned a whole bunch through the ceremony 10 times in a 10 minute ceremony ??anny? yes the bus driver married us , mentioned it we get through the ceremony and get all the pictures and items finished that went very smooth the photographer was just great reception time was supposed to be 6:30 at the italian a la carte we go for 6:30 and they are just starting to set it up at 7:15 they finally had the terrace set up for us no printed menus , no place settings the group was not allowed to go into the restaurant until the workers say myself and my husband as we were walking up we got bombarded by staff asking about our other a la carte reservations ( was this really the time ) after speaking with them for 10 minutes we finally managed to get in to start enjoying our reception the waiters were great about 10 minutes into the reception we were approached by mage she had told me ??ou are getting a round cake? i told her that i thought we ordered a square cake she said you did , but we made a mistake so you get a round cake my husband at this point was so upset not only had there been so many problems , but the fact that the staff would not speak to him about anything , only me and he could see i was clearly upset he pulled her aside i do not know what he said to them , he still has not told me within 30 minutes we had our square cake during the whole speeches the staff were loud , talking , yelling at each other from across the room singing , my guests were very upset near the end of the night mage came up to me and said you don?? get your breakfast in bed in the morning apparently because we did a vow renewal we were not entitled to it my husband proceeded to remind them that this was part of our package and we will get breakfast in bed needless to say if the setting for the wedding was not so beautiful i am sure we would have had a worse time yes these things seem like small problems to a lot of people , but considering how rude janette was ( after we finally got to meet her ) and how un - organized the resort was i feel we are entitled to share our experience not at one point did we feel like the resort cared about the wedding they were more concerned about their money which they still charged us full price for the flowers even though we were missing a bouquet , they charged us extra for 1 bottle of champagne to serve to the guests ( all inclusive ) they charged my whole group for safes that did not work , and no one except me and my husband got our money back and we were even told that it was complimentary because of the construction right next to our rooms they charged us extra for a projector , originally $50 00 charge turned into $180 
nice place but not luxurious resort : 4/5it is a nice , modern and clean place it was built to resist hurricanes garden is beautiful buildings are well maintained it is very family oriented resorts it is definitely not for romantic couples the resort is not as big as it appears it is easy to walk from the beach to the main building in 8min bus service is effective i have seen many larger resorts without bus service we found the resort not as exotic as other hotels that we have visited though the look of this hotel is well above other hotels ' look in punta cana a lot of issue to speak english with the staff they only speak spanish if you are a bbq lover you will not like bahia because you wo not eat anything good from the grill pools : 4/5the pools have a nice design it is easy for children , elderly and drunk persons to get in and out the water is warm but not as clean as we would expect the ocean pool is definitely dirty inside and outside i have the impression that it does not get cleaned every day the pools in middle of the resort are clean and you can see the staff washing the pool side at 9pm the resort does not have enough pool area compared to its size when we were there the hotel had 50% occupancy and we had to battle for chair and towels ( yes they ran out of towels ) bars and drinks : 3/5one of the most effective bar services that i have ever seen there are a lot of waiters everywhere you can get a drink easily there is no line up at noon or in the evening at the reception bars the drinks have good size and taste if you want to get drunk you can get a lot of drinks very fast if you need more rum in your cocktail just ask for a glass of rum on ice and add it to your drink one of the troubles is the quality of the alcohol that they serve they use a kind of dollar type very cheap alcohol basically there is no difference between the taste of the rum/whisky/cognac/tequila house wine is above average beer is just as it music at the lobby bars ca not get worst they play a kind of retirement home music food : (5/5) buffet (5/5) applies to breakfast/lunch/dinnerthe buffet is one of the best that we have tasted in the south everything that they make tasts very good they cook very similar things day after day but so what there are about 40 plates to taste i prefer a resort that makes 40 good plates instead of 100 bad ones though , there is no prime cut meat or fish chicken/fish strudels are great soups are very tasty they have gourmet pizza wide selection of real bread a lot of great local meals adapted to north american taste first time in many years that i did not eat a single egg for the breakfast during 2 weeks they had so many good things to taste just be open minded and taste steakhouse : 0/5entries are really good the soup is a must try the home made chili and the potato skins they are best in their kind eat as much as appetizers you can because what comes after is disgusting after having had all the appetizers we thought that some bad guys wrote some bad review about this restaurant so we were eager to have our main dish i had the lamb it was just bones and fat when i managed to find a little meat and tasted it , i nearly throw up it tasted between sand and coal i think the bbq grill was never cleaned in many months or years my wife had the mixed grill the shrimps were just eatable the steak was poor quality fortunately there was some chicken but tasted very bad i was so upset that i nearly jumped onto the head waiter my wife told me you waste your time italian (5/5) nice restaurant good ambiance good main dishes a lot of food selection meals have the right size do not miss their soup gourmet (4/5) beautiful place you have to choose to have either salad or soup i complained that it is ridiculous and they gave me a free soup soups are delicious i have tasted 3 of them main dishes are a little small if you have the chance to go several times to this restaurant taste different dishes 
good but not great being from another caribbean state , i was a bit apprehensive about what this resort could offer someone who is all too familiar with sun , sea and sand also , i was traveling solo i was certainly impressed with how well the rooms and the grounds were kept the resort transportation trams were reliable a requirement when you are in a beach - front villa and the buffet restaurant , nightly entertainment , spa and shops are 25-30 minutes away when walking briskly all the rooms are the same - junior suites and are a decent size i booked the golden principe club plan and it was worth the small extra costs for the private checking in and out , the room service ( for the really lazy day ) , internet access and a larger number of a la carte dining (4 for a 5- day stay the buffet restaurant had sufficient choices , especially for those who do not gorge themselves on every dish at every meal setting the staff was helpful , some more than others although i made arrangement from early morning with the bellman to collect my luggage on my departure day , i waited for more than a 1 hour after the agreed pick - up time i kept calling up until my actual departure time and he failed to show up thanks to one of the grounds staff , who saw me struggling with my luggage and decided to help , i was only 15 minutes late for my check - in at the airport while the language ( it is a spanish speaking country ) posed some difficulty at times , i thought that that was my problem they certainly knew more english than i knew spanish i was elated that there was a spa but was not impressed with the limited offerings there , although treatments were not that expensive compared with other resort spas i have visited additionally , there were not sufficient excursion choices for me although those who are enamored by the sea would love what was available i thought there would be more sightseeing - when i visit a country , i like to know that i have visited a country , not just a resort i asked about it and my tour operator basically said there was none not sure this was actually a fact all in all i enjoyed the room , the food choicesand the cleanliness of the hotel the staff was pleasant , especially in the buffet restaurants the grounds were well kept and there is a definite attempt to please i am still not sure this resort measures up to many other 5- star properties i have stayed at but it was value for money i would visit this resort again but this time with a group a friends 
apprehensive having read many reviews prior to our visit , i have to say i was a little apprehensive staying for two weeks with my wife and two boys (12 and 10) we booked through first choice holidays in the ukthe hotel is immense , catering for thousands of guests , but the ratio of staff to guests ensures the highest levels of service , all of them were friendly , helpful and seemed genuine the whole place was immaculately kept , the gardens , rooms , lobby , restaurants , bars , toilets etc were spotless the themed restaurants made a nice change from the buffet restaurant , our favourites in order were - gourmet , japanese , barbecue by the beach , italian , and mediterranean didnt try the mexican or the garden grill the buffet restaurant had lots of chioce and was well presented , but catering for so many people has its problems , some of the food was only luke warm and had probably gone past its best i had a bad stomach and felt out of sorts for a couple of days and the wife and kids and a touch of trots as well , whether that was a combination of excesses of early sun , food and beverages or a bug i am not sure but take immodium with you , it will come in useful the maids did a great job on the rooms , daily , although on several occasions it would be 3 or 4 in the afternoon before they got round to our room , which was a bit inconvenient as we fair skinned english needed a siesta in the air condioned rooms and an escape from the afternoon 's intense sun ( beware all take plenty of sun tan lotion and use it on a regular basis ) did several excursions outside the hotel , booked through fc seona island , speed boat and snorkelling and the outback safari , on the whole value for money if not a little on the expensive side tried the scuba diving with my son , unfortunately they took us out into the ocean following a storm , so it was all a bit too choppy to see any real sites under the ocean other than the michael jackson show , the entertainment was dissapointing , and the pools by the beach overcrowded , but many people seemed to be enjoying the fun of bingo , aerobics and dancing lessons and the daily challenges to win a tee shirt or a bottle of rum not the place for piece and quiet i am afraid this was our first go at all inclusive , on the whole this was a positive experience and one , my two boys will remember for ever ( courtesy of the camcorder ) i would recommend this place to others , but you have to appreciate that the sheer size of the place and number of guests and staff means if you are looking for that extra personal touch you will probably be dissapointed but how they get it to work so efficiently is a real eye opener 24 x 7 we have had a great holiday , if you can accept you are in a non english speaking country and are willing to have a go at the lingo you will get by fine tourism is critical for this country and its people , without it i am affraid it would be another haiti and that would be a great shame 
bahia principe is beautiful but we had some problems my family and i stayed at the bahia princupe for one week , july 20th thru 27th i would like to share my thoughts with other tripadvisor readers as i learned so much from reading other reviews first of all let me begin by saying it was my first all - inclusive packsge holiday since my honeymoon 22 years ago having said that i found that the all inclusive thing is a good deal if you are a big drinker and love buffets , otherwise i ' when we arrived at the hotel i was quietly rehearsing my sentence about wanting to be upgraded to the gold or diamond in my very basic spanish but when we got to the front desk we found out we had already been upgraded without even having to ask or pay for it we do not know how this happened but we were not about to ask we were put into the club premiere , a private area with it 's own private pool and restaurant and private lounge the private lounge here was the very best thing we loved about this place it was a large , open area with marble floors and rattan furniture and miniature palms , just stunning in the morning they had a pastry and coffee bar where you helped yourself to croissants , etc and cafe con leche ( basically instant cofee and hot milk ) okay if youre a second cup or starbucks kind 'a guy you will not like this but i loved this kind of coffee or should i say i grew to live it because that 's all there was in the afternoon it was the same thing with different pastries and also many fine twinings teas to choose from there was a bar there as well and internet access no magazines or newspapers to read this would be a welcome addition for me and some of our family we found the food to be a a major disappointment the buffets were full of variety but i was squeamish to try things i had nevers seen before , i i had never heard of and deef - fried pineapple etc , at breakfast the north american type foods i bacon and pancakes , french toast did not taste or look like canadian equivalents and yes , i know we were not in canada but they just tasted so different it made me feel uneasy the doughnuts were made fresh each a and they were delicious as well as all their breads and pastries needless to say i ate alot of those things during the week the a la carte restaurants were fine , the best for us was the french , tender filet mignon and m 'aitre d named josolo was wonderful japanese was fun but we found it to be very average food my kids loved the pasta you could get at all the buffets , they said the french fries and burgers were good too the beach was absolutely beautiful always a breeze and never a problem finding 3 or 5 chairs together i enjoyed seeing women of all shapes and sizes who felt free to wear whatever type of suit they wanted to whether it be a bikini or maillot or topless i was impressed with their self - confidence as they were not feeling trapped by the media frenzy guidelines that women are so often felt compelled to follow in other words if you do not have a perfect body you 'll love showing off what you do have to finish off i 'll say that his resort is more like a four star ( north amer system ) and if you want one week of beach and pools and non - stop drinking then this is the place for you i enjoyed it and i 'm very glad i went but one week was enough for me go and try it out you have to judge for yourself staff are very nice 
not a complainer , but ready to come home i used trip advisor to plan my trip and i feel its only right to contribute back to the site first , let me say that i 'm 32 years old , i 'm very open minded and more than willing to take in new experiences i 'm letting this be known because i refuse to acknowledge myself as a chronic complainer americans , do not expect an americanized resort i had read reviews about europeans being annoyed by the occasional boisterous american i thought it would be nice to avoid that situation also , now that i was bringing my family however , i found that i would probaly prefer those boisterous americans rather than the numerous rude and unfriendly europeans there were not many americans at the resort during this time of the year maybe i 'm just bitter because i like to meet new people and there was a language barrier , who knows the resort is beautiful , the staff smiles did not feel obligated to tip but did anyways presidente and another domestic beer are your options all drinks are served in plastic dixie cups , they were a little larger than shot glasses too small for me frozen drinks were ok this is where i was suprised i am not a picky eater at all but the food was tiresome there were very poor attempts to create food from around the world i 'm not mexican nor a cook but i 'm sure i could put together a better mexican feast than the resort this goes for italian , french , and probaly even dominican they can do alot better than that i 'd like to give an a for effort but for a resort in this price range they should probaly have it right had japanese 2 times , this was good helped us out with liters of milk for our baby jhonny at the pool is hilarious he heads a lot of the activites that you participate in during the days ( water aerobics , dancing , and other various contest ) also is a dancer during some entertainment nights i picked this resort for its family rating on trip advisor i still agree with it but in my case i missed out on 2 aspects of it my infant was too young for kids activites and my 11 year old was too old for them all the kids inbetween seemed to be having a great time the safari excursion was very interesting and i highly recommend doing it if you do any shopping do it on this trip you may still have to barder but not with overly aggressive vendors like there are at the resort mini - golf - do not waste your timespa - very nicecasino - nothing special , small , and you pay for drinks we booked thru apple vacations and our tour rep , petra was awesome she 'll tell you like it is even brought me aloe from her house so i did not have to pay 13us in the lobby shop if you hang out at the pool and the beach you ca not do wrong protective parents , just know that there are topless women on the beach and at the pool my 11 year old was a bit shocked and my infant was constantly thirsty ( joke ) i hope this was helpful and please no hard feelings on the european comment different strokes for different folks 
great time at the bahia principe i stayed at the bahia principe from saturday 7/21 through wednesday 7/25, and had a great time we booked a room on the punta cana side , but when we arrived , we learned we had been upgraded to a hacienda club room when originally booking , i had looked into the upgrades available and decided they were not worth it , but after staying i 'd highly recommend the upgrade to club diamond or hacienda club you have access to a reserved pool and have access to a special breakfast and lunch at the italian restaurant which is right near the pool you also have beach towels waiting for you in your room as part of the upgrade package the location of the rooms in these clubs also seemed more convenient , becuse they were located in the middle of the resort between the reception/lobby/buffet area , and the beach there 's another upgrade available - golden club - and these rooms are located closer to the beach , but further away from the main lobby area overall i was very happy with the resort it is pretty large , but they have trams running all day so you do not have to walk everywhere if you do not want to everything is very clean and well maintained the food is also pretty good - after reading a lot of reviews , i was a little nervous about eating there , but had no problems there 's always something you can find to eat at every meal because they have very large selection we were only staying 4 nights , so we had 2 a - la - carte dinners included in our packages we made reservations the first day for the japanese restaurant , mikado , and the garden grill i enjoyed both , but my favorite meal was definitely at the garden grill service was great at both places , as well as at the buffets i speak very little spanish - a few basic words and phrases , but had no problem communicating with anyone , almost all of the staff speaks english overall i had a great time and was able to really relax and unwind i 'd definitely recommend this place for anyone interested in going to punta cana 
very crowded , too many kids visited - - july 19th -26th 2007prior trips : riviera maya (4 1/2 star resort ) , cancun (5 star resort ) , st thomas (3 star resort ) , barbados (4 star resort ) , 3 cruises ( carnival , royal caribbean , celebrity ) travelers - -2 adults , 1- ten year old girl accomodations - - regular room ( no club ) all rooms are suites we travel 1-2 times per year to the caribbean , always with our 10- yr old daugther this was our first trip to punta cana i do tons of research on tripadvisor prior to booking our first choice was the majestic , but it was booked the gran bahia principe was my 2nd choice grounds - - beautiful and meticulously kept flowers and fruit trees everywhere ( banana , coconut ) service - - very good very nice people someone always around to help you/serve you if you need something from the front desk , all you have to do is say habla englis and they will get someone who speaks english to help you the dominicans we encountered very very nice and tried to communicate with you the best they can much like mexico room - - decent nothing fancy but clean mini - fridge with 7 up , pepsi , water and 2 beers each day bathroom has jacuzzi tub/shower combo fresh flowers in room and towel - art most balconies overlook garden area and other buildings we were on 3rd floor , building 9 close to main pool tv has about 6 english speaking channels pools - - main pool by the beach is usually very crowded many unattended kids everywhere ( ages 5-12) many toddlers also pool is very warm in summer pool bar usually crowded but if you wait about 5 mintues you 'll get served pool in the middle of the resort is less crowded but no food there the other pool across from that pool is reserved for diamond - club guests ( there are manysigns upon entering that pool that say its for diamond - club guests only - - - so we respected that and just went to the pool across the small road that the trolly is on ) the diamond club pool looked about as crowded as the other mid - resort pool anyway ( both less crowded/noisy than the pools by the beach however ) the towel - saving chair game is played here we 've never been to a resort where this was done so it was new to us hard to find a chair at the pool or beach ( in front of resort ) in the shade food - - we 're not food - people if we do not get sick , we 're good ( we didnt get sick ) main buffet for breakfast and most dinners was fine a lot to choose from you wont go hungry never had to wait for a table but it is very loud with noisy children no matter what time you dined ( we tried various times to avoid the small , crying children they are always there ) a - la - cartes were pretty good ( garden grill , gourmet and italian ) but small portions and slow service we made our reservations the day we got there with no issues we saw men in long shorts and they were not refused sandals are fine for both men and women ( and kids ) lunch by the pool was limited hot dogs/burgers , rice/beef , pasta ( various sauces ) , pizza and fresh fruit beach - - crowded with lots of water - sports going on if you want a quiet beach , this isnt it many topless women also , so if traveling with young teens , be aware hard to find a chair in the shade in front of the resort , but if your ok with a chair in the sun you 'll find one if you walk down the beach towards the water - sports huts you might find a shaded spot open crowded in the water also ( roped off areas ) dont go in the un - roped off areas because there are many boats going by water sports - - book things in advance (2 days ) we did the pedalboards and kayaks with no problems but we knew to book in advance motorized sports are extra $$ ( snorkel trips , banana boats , parasailing etc ) snorkeling from beach - - non - existent nothing to see plus too many boats going by made it wavy we walked down the beach pretty far ( to the left as you are looking at the ocean ) , past where the resort - beach ends and i did snorkel a bit from the beach there as there is a patch of coral right offshore see it - - its a dark spot ) its right past where the lady braids hair on the beach ( past the bavara side of the resort ) i took out a roll/bread and i did see some fish but other than that , you 'll have to book a snorkel trip nightly shows - - - the michael jackson show was lively and interesting others are just review - type shows but will keep you entertained for an hour lobby - - gorgeous nightly music and dancing there good bar service ( waitresses walking around ) a few nights they had a coffee card with flaming/various specialty coffees that were good overall - - the resort is nice out of 5 stars , i would give it a 3 1/2 the things that would deter us from going back are : 1 
not quite my family and i stayed here for 2 weeks from the 26th june 2007 i booked through airtours and unfortunately we flew with thomas cook , seat pitch very small (29) , small seats , poor food , poor service and in - flight entertainment it got better when we landed , quickly through the airport and the 30 min drive to the hotel the hotel is beautiful the lobby is stunning , the grounds are beautiful and the place is so clean we stayed in villa 8, the room was spacious and clean , towel sculptures every where and champagne and fresh fruit waiting for us we had been upgraded to diamond club which we were delighted with as we had a pool for use by this club which was quiet and relaxing we found the other two pools and the beach fair too noisy and busy the service around the pool was great and the drinks were good ( try a chocolate or blue hawaii ) always plenty of beds buffet - the food at the buffet was generally very good - fresh pasta station was very good service was very good early in the evening but when it became busy , service was very poor a la cartes - our favourite was the bbq and the steakhouse , service and food very good japanese - was ok but nothing brilliant , set menu - the only choice was which you soup wanted the deep fried ice cream was great italian - did not go on the night as we used this for breakfast and lunch ( change from the buffet ) as the menu on the night is the same as the lunch time menu , did not see the point in going fish - went one lunch time and did not enjoy it - service and food were poor the lobby bar was excellent , service and drinks were great , unfortunately it closes at 11pm the keyboard players are a bit repetitive the shows were ok , just remember they are not professional , go see michael jackson the shopping plaza is good for gifts , the barrow boys do get on yor nerves but just say no haggle for everything , you can get it for peanuts the language is not a problem , majority of the staff speak english , the only thing that annoyed us were the greeters at the buffet , you would tell them you were english and they still carried on speaking spanish overall , we had a great time and would return to this resort but i would not class it as a 5 star 
would not return - very rough around the edges this is the place that you want to send someone you do not like to they will be guaranteed not to enjoy their stay they will also be guaranteed to hear the bahia principe theme song at least 4 times a day we are both american , i am 28 and my girlfriend is 26 we both are very active and like to work out we were there from june 30 - july 9 we have been at numerous all inclusives in the carribean and this does not even come close to any of the others try to learn some spanish before going because it will greatly assist in communicating with the staff we know enough spanish to get around , so that did help us let 's start with the positives + the beach and ocean were awesome get there early in the day to save a good spot + the housekeeping service was also very good we tipped our maid a buck or two a day and they made cool towel oragamies and got bubble baths ready for us as well as stocked our mini - bar with extra drinks if we left notes + we did not need bugspray , in fact neither myself or my girlfriend got one bug bite the 10 days we were there + the cocktail waitresses at the lobby bars provided good service as wellthings that were so - so* * needing reservations to do anything on the resort you will need to make reservations to use any of the watersports that are free we needed to make an ocean kayak reservation 2 days in advance you will also need to book reservations to the theme restaurants save yourself a headache and do this the first day you get there i highly recommend it because it is a nice change of pace from the buffets also , if you are gold or diamond club book your reservations through them instead of the general guest services be prepared to make booking your restaraunt reservations a procedure the resort has about 1800 rooms and only 6 restaurants * * the pools are off of the beach , but they are close to the beach and pool bars the further you get from the beach , the hotter it is on the resort because the beach breeze does not make it past the palm trees on the beach also , they are very crowded and loud they play their only cd that has about 3 songs everyday and the cd is on repeat i kid you not * * the gym is located in the spa it is small , but servicable it is open from 8am to 8pm , so you ca not get there early if you are an early riser it has 5 stationary bikes , 2 treadmills , dumb - bells , and a peice or two of nautilous machines negatives - - the service at the front desk we needed to get our room changed because it was located next to a part of the resort that is under construction this took half of a day to resolve this matter while they left us sit in the lobby they lack motivation and do not really care about the guests because you ca not really leave the resort once you are there after we got our rooms switched , we had to carry our own bags to the new room it does not sound like a big deal , but it is when you are carrying 2 fifty lb suitcases through 95 degree heat with humidity , no wind , and the sun beating down on you - - the buffets could be much better the first two days we were there we thought the food was good the problem with the buffets is that they serve the same dishes of food every day for every meal i will say that the breakfast buffet was good also , the wait staff would take your plate even if you still had a few bites of food left it was like they got a commission for every empty plate they took back to the kitchen it is also very difficult to get a drink in the buffets , soda or alcoholic the trick is to have one person stay at the table to order while the other gets their food on about day 6 we both started to have stomach issues it may have been from the theme restaurants or the buffets we did not eat a peice of lettuce or any of the salads the whole time we were there to try to prevent it go armed with peptol and immodium remember when i mentioned about making reservations at the restaurants that does not coincide very well with upset stomachs we were very surprised how few english speaking guests there were the majority of the guests were either french or french canadian along with the french language comes some visuals that you do not want to see i am talking about topless sunbathers that have no self - awareness or decentcy i know it is another culture , but some things just should not be shown in public it is like taking a gun into the airport , you just do not do it also , for all the ladies the fine men like to flaunt their speedos or even thong speedos i think i have said enough , i still have some nightmares there was also a large number of guests from south and central america some of the lack of self awareness goes on to their children because they would releive themselves right on the beach or by the pool in full public view i kid you not we both got messages , which happened to be reasonably priced the problem with the messages was that i came out of it sorer than when i went in i really do not think they had any formal training the spa is also a long walk from most parts of the resort 
but my sisters and i decided to take a well earned rest in the sun we were able to get a fabulous deal at the gbp for a week in april we flew with westjet ( terrific airline ) and we did not encounter any problems with them or our transfer to the resort very informative bus ride , the guys were great at answering any questions we had they also had our hotel reservations and bracelets on the bus check in was very fast , however , we had to wait 5 hours to get our room not too happy about that there were 3 of us in the room and it was not bad at all room and bathroom , very clean sandra our maid was brilliant we had one leak due to a rain storm but someone was sent immediately to fix it we were impressed by that the resort is big and beautifully kept the pools were nice , but we are beach people at this resort it 's necessary to go down at 5:30 am to get your chairs sure you 're not supposed to reserve chairs , but if you do not play the game you wo not get one the beach is well kept there is a little stand of shops about 45 minutes up from the resort our only real complaint - the food we 're not food snobs at all steaks , chicken , pork all done to perfection it seems they took great pride in their meat , while everthing else suffered it was cold cooked vegetables , pastas it was cold every day we attended the beach party , and they had a creamed spinach dish , i thought great , until i went to eat it , cold unless you were booked at a restaurant , there was very little variety yes i know not to eat everything on the first day : ) oh yes , book as many of the restaurants as you can immediately upon arriving our mistake , we waited we stayed at the riu ocho rios last year and maybe we got spoiled unfortunately we would think twice about returning to the gbp 
the good the bad and the ugly we spent the week of june 23-30 in the d as the result of a last minute opportunity to get away this was our first trip to punta cana my wife and i have been to 5 other all - inclusives and i am comparing this resort to other similiar properties we used apple vacations and were completly satisfied with all their services they greeted us at the departure airport and provided all documents they explained the travel process in the d to avoid any surprises the apple reps wear distinctive shirts to identify themselves and are always willing to help locals claiming to be apple will try to assist with your luggage the bus trip to the resort was well - organized and comfortable the on - site reps were helpful and polite usa3000 was the airline included in the package the flight was non - stop , a bonus for any traveler the agents , flight attendants and pilots were friendly and professional i can recommend apple and this airline without reservation at the hotel , we had a room with a pool view in the middle of the property ( near the wedding gazebo ) the room was clean , the staff courteous and the maids will respond to any request , assuming you can communicate with them no one in housekeeping speaks anything other than spanish learn a few phrases or take a dictionary to translate leave a couple bucks on the pillow they are appreciative the beds were a bit hard for me but we were well - satisfied with our accomodations the room was spacious and the shower very nice without question , the best asset of this resort is the beach there are plenty of chairs , trees and grass huts a drink stand is convenient and the staff attempt to relieve boredom with bingo , water aerobicsand dance contests the staff is enthusiastic and attentive the water is clear , blue - green and soothing the sand is fine and white you can walk for miles in either direction from the resort there are tourist police and resort security since no one goes to town in the evenings , entertainment is provided by the resorts everyone seemed to feel safe all in all , this resort provides a good value for the amenities provided the reviews which suggest bringing much sun protection ( spf50 ) and which warn buying on premises is expensive are totally correct bring everything you need as there is no place to shop the bad : at check - in , we were offered the chance to rent a safe a resort of this caliber should provide a room safe the exercise room was adequate but small for a resort of this size (1500+ rooms ) there is 1 elliptical , 2 treadmills , stationary bikesand free weights the pools are populated by more smokers than i have seen assembled in one place in many years no area of this resort is smoke - free the drinks , while free , are made with house brands of questionable quality due to the size of the resort , transportation is provided by carts pulled by pickup trucks the aroma of a city street seems out of place in paradise over all , i found this resort to be impersonal and without a dedication to quality service that is the trademark of other all - inclusives we have visited the ugly : i do not have unrealistic expectations of food quality at an all - inclusive the ala cartes are by reservation only both the seafood and the japanese were barely edible the middle east was very good beef , in each restaurant , has the tenderness of grilled round steak the buffets serve enormous quantities of food , most of which has little or no flavor the lunches are burgers , pizza , dogs and some variation of the previous evening leftovers there is much fruit however i am convinced this is the source of the intestinal problems common to guests at this resort my wife and i were both careful about the food and drink , yet both got the revenge ( thank god for immodium ) i believe that some workers do not undersand or care about sanitation and food handling the wine is not drinkable and should be avoided the most disturbing staff issue occurs on the beaches many of the patrons elect to go topless the workers have a tendency to clean and wash near attractive sunbathers i heard comments which were lude , offensive and which would have resulted in immediate discharge at most hotels ( they will say anything if english is your language since they do not think you understand them , we are the minority there ) i found this to be demeaning and and an indication that the resort hires to fill positions rather than for quality considerations it further reflects a lack of training and supervision which is a cause for concern for any guest we will return to punta cana , however i will select a different resort 
loved the bahia my boyfriend  i went to the bahia principe from may 26- june 2 and had an amazing time we had read the reviews prior to going and i was so impressed with how informative and helpful people had been that i felt compelled to do the same for others the grounds are truly stunning the maintenance staff are working on upkeeping it 24/7 and it really pays off the grounds are very vast but there is really no prime spot to be at - unless you 're right in the middle , you 'll either be closer to the restaurants and lobby or to the beach there is a tram that runs every few minutes so if you 're not one for the walk , it 's no problem we found the resort to have something for everyone there were tons of couples , there were groups of young people who congregated by the swim - up bar , and there were lots of families with kids it was a really good mix of people here are some tips i can give from our experience : - go to the french and japanese restaurants ( seafood restaurant is crap so double up on one of the others ) - make sure to catch the michael jackson show ( i think it 's on mondays ) - you 'd swear you were actually watching michael - take the marinarium boat cruise - you wo not regret it and bring an underwater camera - take tons of sunscreen - even if you think you have a base tan and you wo not burn - bring it you will burn under the dominican sun - we were upgraded to the diamond club without knowing but i would not have paid for an upgrade it was nice to have 20min of free internet daily to stay in touch with family ( and avoid calling ) , and we enjoyed a 4th a la carte the diamond club rooms tend to be situated in the centre of the resort and you get to have breakfast at the italian restaurant , which was nice ( so we did not have to walk to the front to the buffet ) but again , i do not i would have paid for it pepto or imodium please our stomachs were going crazy down there and we had to run to the bathroom within minutes of eating it 's possible we caught a bug before we got there , as my bf was sick as soon as we got off the plane , but bring it with you nonetheless lots of dollar bills as the staff are so sweet and amazing the beach i s beautiful but i think next time , i 'll refrain from travelling in may/june it was cloudy quite a few of the days but it 's still super hot all in all , we had a great , relaxing vacation and i defintiely recommend this resort although i 'm not one to travel to the same place twice , i was very impressed by the resort and i think i 'd definitely look for a bahia principe at my next vacation destination 
very clean , very hot , very disappointing food overall all , this place is a great value that is if you place no value on food rooms - clean and comfortable but we did have a problem with ants in our bathroom hotel grounds - the bahia is well maintained and very clean there are constantly people cleaning and doing so more than almost anything else its clearly the managements main focus beach - blue , blue water no peace and quiet if you need a quiet place dont even go to this resort beucase there is none constant music makes for a great party atmosphere though you are better off laying out at the beach than at the pool at least there is a cool body of water to hide in and a cool breeze that makes the heat bearable unlike the pool which pool - its a bathtub not refreshing but it does have a pool bar get up early becuase there is a chair problem at the beach and pool under the huts so mark your territory early drinks - they were ok as long as you know not to drink your hotel room water , dont have too many drinks containing coconut and do ask for a double if you want to get anywhere the beer is ok if you like to drink you glass of beer all at once to avoid allowing it to boil in the sun within moments of having it served to you service - they do have wonderful service and the staff is very nice but we were disappointed to find out that there was not any drink waitresses around the pool but the pool bar is pretty good restaurants/food - in short , the food is not very good the snack bar serves everything hot , even when it should not be including cheese and mayonaise do not even expect ice or any thing cold whatsoever ( i think it sublimates once exposed to the ambient air for breakfast the omlettes are safe becuase they are prepared in front of you , for lunch you are on your own my suggestion is the fruit because my feeling was if they ca not cook it its probably safe then again , they did fry pineapples so your rolling the dice at the buffet all week long and they may not tell you this at your travel agent so expect to be allowed only 3 reservations ther rest of they week you are resigned to the buffet but they restaurants are not that great either only the french had consistently good food get in more than once by calling guest services and asking if they have any cancellations also , bring long pants this was another important point my agent left out which caused some big problems they will not let you go to dinner without them overall - its a very nice place giving you a lot of ambiance for your money but leaves a lot to be desired with respect to the food 
warning to all - read before going we went to the bahia from may 4-11 i felt it important to share my experience with all of you as i did read posts from this site prior to booking day 1 friday : arrived at hotel , when you get off the bus , the hotel tags your luggage and they tell you to go ahead to your room after our luggage was out of site , we realized that the room # on the luggage voucher was different than the room # that came with our keys ( they gave us everything on the bus , no check in was required as we were gold ) we proceeded to the room # that was on the luggage tag , after walking for 20min , with no help , we found the first room tried the key , nothing walked another 20min , found the 2nd room , one key ( out of 2) worked , but no luggage in the room we called the front desk , and then waited for 2 hrs before our luggage came to the room then we needed to find the front desk so we could get the key for our safe ( you have to pay ) we walked everywhere on the grounds for 3hrs before finding the right reception we did ask many employees along the way , all pointed us to the wrong direction we decided to let all of the above slide day 2 sat : early am , went to our reception to book our al la cartes , they told us 2/4 restaurants we choose were closed for the week we asked if we could go to the same one 2x , they said no , so we were forced to eat at restaurants that we didn?? like spent the day at the pool , beautiful day dinner , went to al la carte , portions small , service acceptableday 3 sun : spent day at the pool , evening , al la carte , dinner menu exactly the same as night before , service a little better ( it was technically a different restaurant ) day 4 mon : went on day trip bavarro runners awesome trip , full day touring the island dinner at buffet , substandard , would classify food as a 3 star resortday 5 tues : 11:00 am went for massage and body wraps , give treatments a 8/10, sevice at the spa 9 then we went to the pool , buffet dinner , same rating as above evening ( this is when the vacation turned into a nightmare ) went to the disco on the resort ( it opens at 12am ) disco was small , and overall not a very happening place we were having a good time until i was walking and slipped on the floor i landed in a pool of alcohol and glass , someone must have dropped their glass earlier my right hand was cut and had glass in it and my wrist was in serious pain i went to the bar to get some napkins to stop the bleeding , the bartender saw my hand , held it over the bar ledge and poured alcohol on it to clean the wounds i went back to my room , we called the resort medical center ( we had no idea where it was ) by now it was apprx 2:15am , the medical center told us that they can?? do anything right now and to come down in the morning we asked them to bring a tenser bandage , they refused i was very upset , and in pain and began to walk to the medical center ( they are suppose to be 24hrs and in room service ) 5 min into my walk , i couldn?? take it so i changed my mind and headed back to the room then , i found myself locked out ( unknowing to me , my friends left the room to come and look for me ) i was knocking on the door , a room service employee saw me , and then called 2 managers to let me in managers came , saw my hand and drove me to the medical center two females in the center were obviously upset as i had woke them up , they told me $120 us to see the dr i told them i have travellers insurance , they told me to go back to the room and get it at this point , i was tired , frustrated and in pain , asked them again for a tenser bandage and i would pay for it they charged me $10us for a bandage and i had to ask several times for them to put it on my hand was driven back to the room for the nightday 6 wed : went to breakfast , then back to room , called my insurance company for assistance ( still in immense pain ) my insurance co organized everything , called the medical center , faxed them my forms and told them i was on my way there now got to medical center 10min later , there was a sign on the door saying they stepped out and would be back in 30min waited 40 min , they didn?? look at my had and told me someone was coming to take me to the hospital went to the hospital ( in an ambulance , 30 min drive ) , they x - rayed my arm and found my wrist was broken , gave me a cast from my hand to elbow ( insurance covered 100% ) then we realized that they will bring you to the hospital , but no transportation from the hospital we paid $30 us just to get back to the resort got back just in time for al la carte , dinner was very good that night , went to bed earlyday 7 thurs : early am , went to reception as directed by my insurance to get an accident or incident report spent 20 min explaining to an employee what happened , she wrote everything down so i assumed my concern was going to be taken seriously she called her manager over who basically said sorry , thanks for letting us know i told them that i wanted this documented as it happened on their property , her response was we don?? know this happened here , it could??e happened anywhere and you didn?? pay for your treatment so what would you like us to do i again explained about all of the employees that i encountered that evening , she told me if i didn?? have their names they couldn?? do anything so we asked for her manager , they told us she wasn?? available , but they would have her call us , we stormed out very upset i went for a facial treatment ( which i had booked on monday ) , same girl doing treatment , she was amazing , even brushed my hair and helped me dress ( this was the only employee that ever tried to assist me ) i tried to go to the pool and sit in the shade , but it was far too hot with a cast , i stayed in the room the entire day at apprx 5:00, they called the room and told us that we ( me and my two friends ) could stay for 4 days and 3 nights for free we told them that given our experience so far , we would not stay , plus i was confined to the room we advised them that we did have spa treatments , total of $300 us and we would appreciate it if they could settle our bill they told us they would have to check with the general manager of the hotel and would call us back shortly we left the room at 7pm for our al la carte dinner reservation , no call back after dinner , we went to the office as we also needed to check out ( you can check out 12hrs in advance ) and needed to know about the bill they told us they didn?? have an answer yet , we waited 15min , then , apparently they talked to the manger and he told them no , only the free stay so , i asked for the contact info for their legal department , she told me i had to e - mail their customer service , and refused to provide me with a name or number then i asked for the name of the general manager , she also refused me that info i asked her to call the female manager michelle ( not the gm ) down so i could talk to her , they appeared to have called her , then told me she had gone for the day i stormed out ( again ) twenty min later , we saw michelle walking the grounds , i approached her and told her that i need some form of documentation that this was reported so that when i go home and try to deal with this , the hotel wont deny it she told me that she would have to talk to the gm about a report and she would meet me in the office the next day at 10am day 8 friday ( leaving day ) : walked up to the front for the meeting with michelle , we noticed an ambulance in the middle of the grounds and a woman lying on the marble walkway in serious pain it was very obvious that she slipped , and her leg was broken , she was screaming in pain we also saw michelle on the scene we waited aside for michelle , she definitely saw us after about 5min , the ambulance was gone , michelle took the long way around so she wouldn?? have to walk by us i tried to catch up to her , called her name 3x before she finally turned around i told her i knew she was busy , but we are leaving and i need to know about my report , she rudely said ??ts in the office didn?? they tell you and walked away i went to the office , expecting some form of prepared document explaining what i had reported , i was handed a form to fill out , it was titled ??omplaint form? i asked why they didn?? provide me with that the 1st time i had come , they told me that they had to wait for the hospital report i asked if anyone had actually investigated or spoken with the employees/managers that had contact with me after the accident , they said they didn?? know my friend filled out the complaint form for me ( same form if we wanted to complain about the food ) and we handed it back to them end of storyit should also be noted that i did contact the air transat rep who basically had the same attitude as the hotel ??hat do you expect them to do? i did explain that it wasn?? about money , but if they would have simply asked how they could help me to make the situation better , by employees helping me at the buffet , anything would have been sufficient , but they denied it happened and honestly put me through hell on another note , i can give one good comment about the resort , the grounds are immaculate 
this was our third time staying at a bahia principe resort ( we were a group of 7) - the first time in punta cana and we were not disappointed we stayed at the bavaro - premier club from april 19th to the 26th overall the weather was good - even when it was cloudy it was still nice and warm this resort is huge - which may scare some people off but there is a great trolley system that runs all of the time - which was needed as we were travelling with two grandmas at first we were disappointed to find that we were so far from the beach - a good 12 minute walk - however , we soon learned that our nice amenities in the premier club were a blessing we spent some time at the main pool - but found it extremely busy even our kids who are teenagers preferred the pool in the premier section ( which was the blessing part ) we also had our own reception club , buffet and snack bar - we appreciated being away from the crowds the beach is amazing we would walk from our resort in either direction for 30 minutes and still have lot 's of beach to cover the beach was clean and the water was also clean and clear very little seaweed if any it could get busy - one had to get there early to get chairs if it was really sunny out lot 's of selection on the food and i would recommend trying the chocolate monkey at the premier club swim up bar we had a slight problem with the flooding of our rooms late one afternoon - unusually hard rain for a couple of hours and we were on the main floor of our villa we were quickly given new rooms and management had engineers coming in to rectify the problem to eliminate any future occurrences we would definitely go back and would defintely recommend this resort to others 
lying in the sun we have just returned from a wonderfuly relaxing week at the gran bahia yes , the site is large but we really did not find this a problem , we were in villa 35 and the beach was aprox 6 mins walk from reception i 'd say about 10 mins and of course there are the trolley buses if you really do find the walk too much of a chore the beach is beautiful , with clear seas and swinging palm trees and there are 4 swimming pools too so there really is something for everyone you can find quiet spots to sit just back from the beach if just want to chill and read etc or some of the pools have music and the usual holiday activities the food was generally good , we ate in the italian , mediteranean and the barbecue restaurant all which we enjoyed very much in the main buffet you will always find something you like , there is a pasta bar and salad bar every night and a roast the thing to remember is you have probably not paid 5* money to come here , we paid ?640 for one week flying from gatwick and just wanted to sit around in the sun and do nothing , it was perfect for this having said that i think the resort would cater well for families or couples the only thing that let the holiday down was the airline , mytravel i really cannot say how utterley useless they were and little care they have for their passengers , i will never travel with them again all in all we had a fantastic week and enjoyed everyminute 
would love to go back we stayed at the bahia principe from april 23-30 and had an absolute fabulous time we were a little nervous after reading some of the reviews , but we honestly have no complaints you just sit back , and enjoy yourself put the regular busy life behind you and go at their pace of course , there are only a select few staff who speak good english , but they are so friendly and will get you what you need as soon as they can we had no complaints about the food - we really enjoyed the las olas bbq on the beach (7 different meats ) as well as the breakfast ( omlettes made to order book your a la cartes right away and familiarize yourself with the resort on your first day it does seem confusing at first , but it 's not as complicated as it looks we ate at la gourmet , las olas ( twice ) and the garden grill we had the gold package , which was great 15 minutes internet everyday ( which was important to us to keep contact with our kids at home ) beach towels in your room , 4 restaurants instead of 3, etc the beach is fantastic you can walk for hours ( which we did we did not have to wake up too early to get good chairs ( with shade ) i think by 8 or so it starts filling in which is not too bad shopping in pueblo principe was fun the theatres , shows , etc were entertaining as well remind the bartenders/waitresses to just give you a little bit of alcohol in your drinks if you are not a fan of strong drinks they are not stingy with that for sure we liked the many different cultures of the guests as well listening to all the different languages was interesting anyway - this is becoming longer than i thought it would be we loved it , would go back in a heartbeat we met many people who were there for their second time , all of whom told us , we do not usually go to the same place twice , but we love it here to us , that says a lot hope you enjoy yourself as much as we did 
we stayed at the bahia prinicipe the week of april 21 thru april 28 it is a very big and nice resort we suposed to stay in bavaro side but due to overbooking they gave us club premier room the farest place to the beach but quietly and clean with a private pool we had 4 a la carte rezervations but we used only 2 because the buffet was ok and we did not like the food at the restaurants ( the italian one was a joke ) the drink was ordinary to poor if you want something good you have to pay extra the room it 's very nice big and clean with everything you need inside is very eficient the pools and the beach ok too big and clean , but the towels looked very used and need to be replaced the watersports are allmost missing 6 days from 7 we had red flag and everything was on the ground do not forget this is an atlantic ocean 's beach and the waves are big enough diving and deep sea fishing are just wasting time and money all in all it was nice but i would not go back again 
nice resort , average food was our only complaint my wife and i and two children ages 11 and 8 vacationed at the bahia principe punta cana april 5th -12th , 2007 we travelled with another couple and their two children of the same age if you have read any reviews you already know that this resort is huge it was a little big for my taste but it was not a real problem the trams are quite convienent for getting from one end to the other we stayed in the club golden section and if i were ever to go back i 'd stay there again it is much closer to the beach we were in villa 23 which was close to the main pool and beach we did get up early , around 6:30am , to reserve a palapa at the beach even at that time the prime spots were usually already taken i 'm sure if you waited much longer you would not get a spot with some shade the food was our only real complaint i 've stayed at quite a few all - inclusive resorts so i know not to expect gormet food however the food here just was not all that good you could usually find something to suit your taste so at least nobody went hungry my wife and my friends wife each got sick once i 've found that at the all - inclusives that i 've been to the a - la - carte restaurants are normally much better than the buffets here , even the a - la - carte restaurants were just average i 'd say the japanese was the best the food at the french was pretty good but it took over two hours not good when dining with kids the garden grille ( steakhouse ) was pretty bad and we did not make our reservation to the itailian , i 'm sure we did not miss much the buffets were okay , the steaks had a decent taste but were very fatty and way undercooked lots of variety at the buffets so you 'll find something that you like we usually ate lunch at the grill by the main pool again , nothing to write home about but it was convenient you can get breakfast at the two restaurants by the main pool , but if you want made to order omelettes you need to go to the main buffet near the lobby the drinks were fine , a little inconsistent but not too bad if you find a bartender who makes good drinks , tip him well and he 'll take good care of you all week we really liked ramon at the swim up bar after reading a lot of reviews myself , i knew to bring along some insulated mugs these were great to have and saved you trips to the bar the first day we arrived , the mini - bar in our room was stocked with two brahma beers , two pepsi 's , two orage pops and two large bottles of water we tipped the maid $4 per day along with a note mas cerveza por favor each day after that there were 12 beers in the fridge i was expecting el presidente beer from everything i read but did not get one all week the brahma beer was just fine though the guys got out for a round of golf it 's expensive we chose one of the cheaper courses , punta blanca , and it was $160 per person nice course , but i 'd say not worth more than $75 back home it 's a nick price designed course that just opened 4 months ago it actually straddles the resort so there is no drive time to get there most of the other courses are 45-90 minutes away and even more money the nicklaus course is $330 and the two pete dye courses are $225 and $250 if nothing else , bottled water , beer and even lunch after your round are free at punta blanca , so that takes some of the sting out of the price the ladies decided to swim with the dolphins at dolphin island in hindsight , it was a ripoff it was $95 for 10 minutes of swim time , plus it cost the rest of us $15 per person just to spectate and as for the spectators , you ca not get within 40 feet of the pool where they are swimming plus it 's a long drive to get there stopping at several other resorts along the way i would not recommend this excursion at all for the girls , our daughter wanted to get her hair braided it costs $83 at the reosrt if you walk down to where they do the water sports , there is a tent where they will do it for $50 the room was big and clean the grounds are very well maintained the pools are very nice for such a large resort i never really felt like it was too crowded we never really waited in any lines for drinks or food and the beach is spectacular probably the nicest beach i 've ever been to even as you walk along the beach and check out other resorts along the way , i 'd say the bahia had the nicest beach all in all , i would recommend this resort to friends one other thing , bring lots of sunscreen $20 per bottle at the resort have fun , and do not sweat the negative reviews 
the whole story all righty this is going to be long but i always appreciated being able to read others reviews when you are here you are in paradise so any complaints are in that context we stayed 8 nights on april 8 through april 16 checking in was horrible the worst experience of my trip we are a family of 5 we requested through our apple travel agent connecting rooms , one king and one with doubles , high floor , near the ocean we got two rooms not connected but close , no where near the ocean , on the first floor , with two kings so basically if we asked for it we got the opposite speaking to the manager at the hotel got me nowhere he said that was all he had , if i knew this before going i would not have gone that being said we are in a foreign country after spending a loads of money on a vacation so i was determined to make the best of it the weather do not pay any attention to the reports it is hot , hot hot and humid can not believe it is only in the 80's it feels much hotter light clothes , as many bathing suits as you have , hats , flip flops and tons of sunscreen we went through 5 bottles while there and everyone in my family got burnt at least once husband is hispanic so yikes the sun is burning ) the pools - nice yes it is true 730 am is the latest time to reserve your chairs under a umbrella it will not even be your first or second choice so go early they really are all reserved early the beach - beautiful my husband went at 545 am to reserve a umbrella and 90% were already gone so who knows reserve before you go to bed the night before crazythe food - okay i am in the fine dining business the only thing i can figure is that the people who did not like any of the food are people who are very picky and only have simple taste if you are an adventurous eater you will always be able to find a few things that you love the coconut ice cream is to die for the breads are all fresh baked and sooooooo good make sure to make yourself a piece of toast in the morning and enjoy try the banana juice yum the fruit is fantastic the lamb wow greatthe beef ummmm its do able maybe our version of select meatsthe pork excellentthe fish i had no luck with at all except the smoked salmon was niceokay that being said the different restaurants , do not bother to save yourself time and eat by the beaches or pools they are not half as nice as the main buffet do take the time to go to the main lobby buffet for all your unreserved meals the steak house for me was a wasted reservation , it was just too hard to communicate our orders and the meat was tough the fish was well lets just say when i heard my daughter ask for a steak knife to cut the fish we sent it back the seafood restaurant was gross four of our meals were overcooked again we could not communicate with the staff the french restaurant on the bavaro side - was okay the food that was good was great the service not so muchthe french restaurant on the punta cana side wow we went twice i was not expecting this quality of service as well as food i can not say enough about it get the cheese tray for dessert yumthe employees english is limited at best most do not understand anything i fully am aware that we are in their country but am used to taking mexico vacations where they do know most english or are in the process of learning our vacation would have been much better if we all could have communicated to the staff i am fortunate enough to know minor words and my husband knows more but still we had many questions go un answered do to the language barrier i had a piece of glass in my food once - that?? worth mentioning i told the waiter he did not understand and walked away with my plate tipping we tipped tipped and tipped bar or cocktail service a buck a roundour maid service - great the best we have had , we read the reviews and took the advice of others 2 bucks a day per room for the maid and twice we tipped her ten ( my three year old had two accidents ) as well as brought gifts for her nail polish , jewelry , lip gloss a small gift a day per each room by the time we left she was knocking on our door and hugging us , she actually left us gifts as well , dominican dolls we had fresh flowers towels extra pop beer water whatever we asked for the servers in the restaurants we tipped 2 at dinner 3 at lunch and 5 at dinner the sit down restaurants 5 for the waiter 3 for the wine steward 2 for the bus boy and a couple to the host it 's strange to us how a couple of dollars can light up their faces so much it really does the apple vacation rep - again the english it was rough i did not find that they were there to help or assist us the orientation was two minutes reviewing the map of the hotel and 25 minutes on what they could sell you very displeased with apple i thought when i found out we had a representative at our hotel that they would there to insure we had a great time , nope their there to take more of your money the markets friday is the best day to shop because they allow outside vendors in but before friday comes if you can get down there and get a feel for what is going on the prices they tell you are usually three times what they will sell it for just tell them 10 bucks and see where you get they play the game well ask you to type your price in their calculator , explain to you the quality blah blah blah tell them best price 15 times and you may be surprised i can say if you pay more then half their first price you 've been taken the hotel gift shop wow crazy prices so bring sunscreen and aloe if not you will be paying 12-18 dollars for a small container 7 bucks for a travel size baby oil so just bring all your cosmetic and possible medication needs do not plan on buying stuff at the airport they are also way over priced one of the vendors told us that they are now regulating the prices , and he is actually selling less much less now that he is being told what he must charge for things cigars coffee liquor are all less at the hotel and eat before you go unless you would like to spend 12 bucks for a wendy?? single combo meal check out was fine that?? it hope it helps enjoy your vacation 
my husband and i just returned from our stay at the grand bahia principe first of all , for all those of you that are staying here soon ignore the weather reports i read the same thing from others who stayed here it never rains it said that it would rain and storm every day and we did not get a drop we loved the food , the breakfast buffet was really good , we ate there every morning try the watermelon juice and banana juices to die for the french restaurant was definitely the best we ate there 3 times it was soo good get the smoked salmon with avacado cream ( app ) seabass ( entree ) and the chocolate desert oh my god , just thinking about it makes my mouth water the beach bbq was terrible the lobster is not maine coldwater lobster , it is hot - water mush and disgusting dont waste a night on this the japanese restaurant is okay we eat japanese a lot and it was only okay you dont get yellow sauce which we are used to if you get hibachi express takeout a lot , dont go here the best bar to go to is the one directly on the beach i also enjoyed the lobby bar they have all the good liquors and dont forget to tip dirty monkey was my favorite frozen drink but overall , we were a little dissappointed because our room was right next to the lobby if i went to the beach and realized i left something in the room , i could count on it taking 45 minutes to get back the resort is sooooooo big and confusing i stayed for a week and would much rather have stayed at a smaller place that would have saved me money anyways try to get a room as close as possible to the beach another downer for us was there were very few americans here nightlife here sucks , but maybe thats because we were so tired at night after being in the sun all day make sure you take a nap before dinner if you want to go out at night the disco doesnt open until midnight i would not stay here again unless my room was very close to the beach 
nice and clean , but it stops there my wife and i stayed at the bahia principe punta cana from march 28 to april 04 2007 upon arrival we were let off the bus practically on a mangrove bush and handed a red glass of something that most guests discarded after tasting it i then followed their lead and discarded mine without tasting it as our flight time was moved up 2 hrs in toronto we arrived early at the resort most rooms were not ready , however ours was we were told that this was because we were gold club members ( this is not worth the upgrade , as you get the exact same as a regular guest , other then a separate check in and checkout area in which you have to wait longer then a regular guest because it is not staffed adequately ) we were told that we had express checkin this is to say that we were given a bracelet on the bus and some information packages then we were rushed off to our room without given the opportunity to get our safe or book our al a carte restaurants , the safe cost us $28 00us extra , i thought this was a rip off this may sound trivial , but i can tell you that it is not this resort is so big , that if you have to make a trip to the lobby you will be a minimum of 1 hour , and be prepared to get lost during this hour at least once ( it took us 2 5 hours to get it all done ) roomson a good note the rooms were appointed very nicely we were suppose to get turn down service , but this did not happen until 5 days into our stay ( i really dont care about that sort off stuff , but it was promised ) seemingly corresponding to a mass in flux of guests from europe i can say that i personally noticed a difference in service when the europeons arrived up to this point there were no beach waiters , but there was after the europeon in flux foodi found the buffet to be a better option then any of the a la carte restaurants the food at the mexican restaurant was absolutely horrendous and also at the mederteranian the italian restaurant was ok but was the most entertaining the portion sizes at the a la cartes was somewhat smaller then you normally see at a gourmet restaurant if you dont like it you can go to the buffet afterwards , its open til 10:30 pm beachthe beach is phenomenol you can walk for hours and you will have to has you will be unable to find a chair unless you are up and at the beach at 6:30 am the only beach that i have found that compares is on the isle of kauaii , hawaii i personally would not recommend this resort to my friends or family it is too big and i wasted too much time looking for stuff i did not find the food good , in fact both my wife and i became ill at the end of the week , and are still sick two days after arriving home we did not get the services that were promised in the brochures and in general i felt like i was treated like a head in a herd of cattle dc millsontario , canada 
looks like a 5 star but something was missing we are a canadian couple in our 30's and we stayed here end of march 07 booked through sunwing one comment on sunwing while i realize this is a charter flight and flight times are subject to change , we purchased our package based on some great flight times , a 6 am departure and 9:15 pm return both got changed to our disappointment and to our disadvantage we ended up departing halifax at 10:15 am and returned at 3 pm we felt like we lost out on time on our vacation and we had paid a small premium to book with this tour operator based on the flight times not cool sunwing it felt a bit too suspicious to us , like a bait and switch , which , of course , they deny as for the bahia , we stayed close to the club diamond pool , about midway down the resort , in between the lobby and the beach and it was a good location , i felt let me start off with the good :1) check in was done on the bus trip from the airport by michael , a very nice guy from reception very very convenient 2) the beach was fabulous large , long beach with beautiful water and soft white sand our room and the whole resort were very clean no musty smell in our room staff working non - stop although the resort is very large , the trolleys run non - stop i did not mind the walk sometimes lots of pools , restaurants , bars , a spa , a little shopping and entertainment square on site no lack of amenities here internet available all around the resort 15 minute time limits , but convenient book the french , italian and garden grill restaurants , the italian was our favorite , both for service and food here 's the not so good the food was so - so wednesday night at the buffet was very good , nice rib - eye steaks and good variety otherwise , too much repetition from night to night at the buffets , it all feels the same 2) animation staff , with the exception of kassandra , is unmotivated and pretty lazy there was stretching , aerobics and dance lesson on the beach , but it was the same every day , no attempt to get to know you or liven things up i was a little caught off guard when one of the dj 's asked me to get him some drinks for himself and another one of the guys i 'm the one on vacation , and he asks me to get him drinks give me a break i should 've reported him but i guess that 's not in my nature , i ca not stand the thought of costing somebody their job , even if he did that there was a bad smell in the bavaro lobby buffet especially noticable at lunch times the staff was just okay they seemed generally unmotivated and unhappy there were of course some exceptions victor and the whole crew at the lobby bar were awesome 5) the entertainment was really bad comedy night especially horrible the dancing in the michael jackson show was good the lip - synching was hilariously bad we enjoyed the later entertainment at pueblo principe more avoid the dominican and seafood restaurants at all costs both are horrible we had some bad luck and hit a week of not so great weather it poured buckets for almost 2 whole days and was windy the rest of the time but you ca not control the weather in all , the resort is nice for families , i would not recommend it too much for couples looking for a romantic getaway it looks great , and has all the amenities of a 5 star but the personalized attentive service was lacking , the warm and cozy feeling that we have experienced before was not there this time around would we returrn not unless it was with our kids and we got a smokin deal we enjoyed the mayan riviera more 
better resorts out there for that price last visit : march 2007this is the fifth year we have been to punta cana during march break perhaps our expectations were too high based on reading of reviews before we went let 's start with the good : i ) the rooms and complex were well maintained and clean ii ) the staff was friendly and spoke english quite well ii ) food in the a la carte restaurants was good now the not so good : i ) we felt they cheaped out at the buffet especially at breakfast no cooked ham , limited fruit , no granola ( only oatmeal ) ii ) luncheon buffets had less variety than at other resorts we have been atiii ) the main pool by the beach was extremely crowded - we needed to get up at 5:30am to reserve a pool chair iv ) we checked - out in the late afternoon (5:25pm ) - other hotels routinely offer you a courtesy room in which to shower and change this hotel offers you shower facilities off of the main lobby after paying club golden prices it is not pleasant to have to shower and change in a public washroom other than in the main lobby you could not get a cappucino or expresso all of the negatives about this hotel are in the context of other punta cana hotels we have stayed at in the past on the face of it , this is a great facility but around the fringes it is evident they are exerting heavy cost control others may not have noticed the aura of a management team more interested in their bottom line vs client experience was , in our minds , quite evident we will not be returning 
pretty lame place went out there with a group of 7 in our 20s and 30s from the east coast , usa the trip was worth it for the follow reasons :1) good company2) good weather3) nice roomsother than that the place was all old sunburned people from canada - who were often very annoying the nightlife was a complete joke the place basically shuts down at 11 except for the brutal nightclub where the omnipresent resort employees are leading their corny dance routines pretty hanus buffet - and the coffee was usually freezing wine was horrifying everywhere the japanese place was half - way decent the mexican place was terrible the resort employees some were nice , but incredibly annoying on the beach they have a dj out there blasting terrible music - usually the bahia principe song , which is torture seeing all these old people doing beach aerobics was also pretty revolting 
beautifull resort , great staff but my wife and i just came back from a week ( 12 mar 07 ) at the grand bahai the property is very well kept and beautifull but a few things could be better , first - hide some towells in your room has we found that you do not get fresh towels until after supper , so when you come to your room after a day in the sun you have no towels to shower with before supper , we had to phone three times for towels no complaints about the food , buffet had lots of choice , the french and japanese a la carte restaurant were excellent , the staff is great our maid tried all she could to get us towels but it was not her fault that the clean towels were not delivered to her until after supper wanna and victor in the lobby lounge were excellent and very entertaining , say holla for us we miss them already one big problem is too many familly with kids ( babys to 5,6 years old ) do not get me wrong we also have children , but when you spent that kind of money it is not to lesson to other kids , and why spent that kind of money and not relax with - out them the other problem is the resort althought beautifull it is too big and their is too many people ( 5000 +/ - ) have to get up every morning at 7:00 to 7:30 to reserve a couples of chairs at the pool or the beach has some people do the same and do not show up until late afternoon , there is a 2 hrs limit on the chair reservation as per resort rule and be considerate to other people 
problems from the start please beware of this hotel if this is one of your choices for a resort to punta cana , pick another hotel from day one this place was full of aggravation very important : ask for a copy of the receipt they ask you to sign at the hotel bars or restaurants they tried to cheat us when we were checking out on our last day the front desk reception area are not properly trained , it took us 2 hours to get this charge removed from our bill we had to actually keep explaining the situation about the bottle of wine , they said we order was not on the receipt when we signed it we finally kept pushing them to get the waitress we had at the buffet to come out and tell them what happened , and she confirmed that when we signed it there were no charges on the receipt or the bottle of wine they only got the waitress when we said that this was fraud and illegal what they were doing they did not even apologize to us when they accused of ordering this bottle of wine this is not the kind of service you expect when you go on vacation they do not always give you what you pay for the 3 al carte meals are very deceiving they tell you have to reserve it at guest services but when you go they do not have any reservations available , they give you a whole song and dance that they do not have enough food and staff they had no problem taking your money right away also , you are only allotted 3 al a carte meals if you stay for the whole 7 days they fail to tell you that when you check in the food is much better at the restaurants then the buffet when you could get reservations the food was just edible , nothing fancy or amazing there were plenty of empty tables at the restaurant , the grill near our rooms when we passed by it from 7 pm to 8:15pm when we were told that day it was totally booked also , they have a big problem when you ask for extra towels for the room , we had a flood from the ceiling leaking when we first arrived and the repairman used some of our towels to clean it up and they would not give us extra towels we actually asked the maid next day to give us towels and she said she had to get permission we got one extra towel the next day and guest services actually called up the room to basically scold us for asking for towels who ever heard of a hotel doing that they made the excuse that they were booked and could not give us anymore towels believe me , i will never recommend this hotel to anyone the waiters and waitresses might have been friendly but the upper management could care less about the comfort of their guests they tell you that you can take up your problems with guest services but the manager , helena was no help she just made excuses why things could not be done save yourself the annoyances of this resort and book somewhere else where you will be treated with respect and be able to enjoy yourself the resort may look pretty but there is definitely no substance behind it i ca not believe how unrelaxed i was from this vacation you expect to get some fun in the sun there is no reason paying good money to get this kind of treatment 
poor food and no personal service the room was lovely , available chairs in a crowded time food was very poor two rooms out of five in our party had money taken and upon complaint , got no feedback 
loved it but came back with salmonella well , i thought i would add our experience as there is a bit of a mixed bag from people that were there at the same time as us we were at the gran bahia from october 9 - 23 just a bit about us first , i was 20 weeks pregnant , and travelled with my husband and 2 1/2 year old son lots of people have talked about the features of the resort so i wo not really go into those , other than to say we really loved it we booked club golden and had a great room down in villa 23, right by the mexican restaurant and near the beach and pool and if we strained really hard when looking out balcony we could see the sea i 'll cover things that i 've seen people complain about and add our experience firstly club golden , did we think it was worth it the room was great , clean and well stocked we were very close to the pool which meant it meant that when the rain came ( which it did a fair bit in the second week ) , we could quickly get back to our room it was nice having the additional nights in the ala carte restaurants as we were staying for 14 nights the variety was welcome we did also use the internet access a few times and when we had a leak in our room , after the heaviest rain i have ever experienced so i do not blame them , we were able to call the golden express line and they sent someone immediately to sort it out for us the staff - the staff were all fantastic , we did not have one nasty or negative thing to say about them i really believe it is a case of you get what you give with people and if you treat people well , then they will do the same for you people we spoke to that did have problems more often did seem to occassionally bring it on themselves we did also regularly tip both the maid and in the restaurants we also left messages for the maid for the drinks we wanted the minibar stocked with ( pretty much beer and diet coke most days ) , with a couple of dollars and without fail it was well stocked the restaurants - we did find most of the restaurants quite good i must admit i relied a lot of pizza , salad , ham  cheese toasties and pasta in the buffets , but being pregnant i was not feeling particularly adventurous the food was not always very hot , but this is quite often the case with buffets we ate in every restaurant on the complex and our favourites were the grill and the mexican the french was good and it was nice to have a formal dining experience , the italian was ok , but we found one day was significantly better than another so seemed dependent on the chef , the sushi was lovely in the japanese but not so good for our 2 1/2 year old and it would have been nice if they could have offered a child friendly option also , if anyone ca not find anything on the menu in the mexican , grill and seafood restaurant you can just get the buffets in there and they were great , lovely salads and different enough from the main buffet to be interesting the pools - we tried both pools and they did have quite different atmospheres the middle pool had music playing and was a bit more 'fun ' it was dirtier though than the main pool near the beach but was nice as it was all in one with the swim up bar , toddler pool and jacuzzi all the pools had fantastic toddler pools and large shallow areas next to them for younger children our son spent about 5 hours a day pottering around and had the time of his life he also really enjoyed the bubbles - the cold water jacuzzis for that reason alone this resort got a thumbs up from me the main pool was actually split into two pools , one with the swim up bar and the other with the kids pool and also where water polo was played every afternoon as far as activities were concerned i did water aerobics a few times but you did not really know where they were as the activity board did not appear to state which pool the activities were being held at i know everyone says this , but the resort was kept amazingly clean i 've never seen anything like it , the floors were buffed , the brass cleaned , the walls wiped down every day language - for those that complain about the lack of english spoken , i say get a grip you are in a foreign country , i 'm afraid i have little time for this complaint if you do run into problems you will find that the staff on the front desk speak english well and are more than likely very happy to help also take an english / spanish dictionary as that will help rain - hmmm , it did rain quite a bit , but the sun shone quite a bit as well it was also warm enough that if you wanted to swim in the rain you could and it would usually pass quite quickly there was one thunderstorm though that was amazing and the loudest thunder i 've ever heard in my life , but by 7 o 'clock it had passed and we had a clear night ( btw , all the rooms have umbrellas for guest to use when they are outside - very handy ) finally sickness - we did unfortunately meet quite a few people that had been very ill while on holiday and two of them had to go to hospital due to severe dehydration , one poor little boy had a very high fever and severe i 'm mentioning this because ultimately the hotel does have a duty of care in food hygiene and unfortunately i think this hotel has a problem in this area we gave ourselves a pat on the back on our last day for having escaped without any major problems other than slight on and off diarrhea ( which i would expect in a place like the dominican republic anyway ) but on our return to the uk i got quite a severe case of it and had some tests run and it was discovered that i had salmonella i was lucky in that it was not a severe case ( particularly being pregnant ) , but given the number of people that fell ill during our stay i suspect there was a contaminated area that was reinfecting the food and therefore people all in all i think the gran bahia is a great resort and we would go back again as i think the sickness problem is something that can be addressed and i 'm sure will be , but if anyone is going to be travelling there in the immediate future i would recommend taking some care 
got sick and went to hospital , missed my flight home like the title says i did not have a good stay my girlfriend and i planned a 7 day vacation but stayed 10 days in punta cana as i will shortly explaineverything was fine ( where fine is defined by the last paragraph ) till the fourth night my girlfriend really likes seafood ( mainly from buffet ) and was eating that all the time by the fourth night she got sick and vomitted like 4-5 times and by the next morning we went to visit the hotel doctor because she could not keep anything including liquids in the doctor recommended shots to stop the vomitting and then pepto bismal and some gravel equivalent i think my girlfriend does not like shots and who would have thought just eating their food would require such extreme measures so we just opted for the medicine after a few hours we had to come back because she did need the shots cause she continued to vomitted anytime she ate or drank i by the fourth nite had diarreha but after taking some immodium felt fine i actually hate seafood and never ate any i like pretty much what my girlfriend does not so we pretty much covered the entire selection they had which after the first couple days you get sick of on the last nite , we decided to use our last reservation for the italian rest i do not think my girlfriend was really up for it but she insisted on making the best of our last nite i ate the lasagna which i thought tasted great but after eating it i instantly felt very uncomfortably full 1 hour after dinner or so , i thought i would feel better if i went to the washroom and when i got there to my surprise had to vomit instead and from then on , i pretty much vomitted every 20-30 mins i could literally identify everything i ate that meal and afterwhich it was all liquid/acidic like vomit the symptoms looking very similiar to what my gf had , i lasted 2-3 hours before going to the hotel doctor she gave me the same treatment but it clearly was not working she then proceeded to hook me up to an iv i stayed there for a few hours , now very dehydrated , somewhat shaking and taking very irregular breathes the doctor eventually called th ambulance i stayed for 2 nites at the hospital before being released a review of the dr hospital experience is probably outside the scope of this review the doctor could only explain my illness by saying foreigners are sometimes not used to the food especially on their first visit although i am sure this is true , that seems like quite a poor excuse also note that the hospital was filled with tourist patients , and the patient across from us was from the same resort with similar a conditioni did not take any type of medication/shots that people have since told me may help before travelling thank goodness for all inclusive travel insurance the delayed flights home , and hospital costs were well in the thousands also thank goodness my girlfriend was there to take care of all matters with the hotel , insurance company and me if she ever happens to read this review , she 'll know i am forever grateful i know this is an extreme case and there seems to be a lot of highly rated reviews lately before i went i read a lot of reviews on tripadvisor and back then gran bahia was rated #2 ( guess it 's dropped a spot since then ) i was probably more prepared than the avg person because i had read so many reviews brush teeth with bottled water , get 3rd floor suite to avoid ants , not near marsh where there are a lot of flies etc , etc all i can say is go at your own risk i will never go there again , probablly not even to the dr but that 's just me aside for the being sick , the place was okay nice looking resort and room but pool pretty dirty , bugs in the towel animals , they kind of skimpped on the towel/face cloth replacement but we had ample bottled water not much to do besides lounge around on the resort no night life hope this helps 
a love/hate resort experience what is funny is that just about every instance mentioned in recent reviews , we encountered to some degree or another during our stay and i know that if i started another sentence with well , a lot of the people on tripadvisor said , my husband was going to deck me anyway , i absolutely agree that the grounds of the resort are gorgeous and the facilities and rooms are kept in immaculate condition we were very fortunate that we did not encounter any major intestinal issues as some of you did ( with the exception of some touch and go situations ) but i will admit , i was a bit leery of how the food was prepared and set out hot food was never really that hot and the cold stuff was never that cold the snack bar at the pool was especially worrisome as there are some things that are just not meant to sit out in 90 degree heat for hours at a time ( i starting taking acidopholus the week before we left and recommend it as a preemptive strike against any possible bad bacteria will undoubtedly find something to keep them from starving but i think we were a bit disappointed to find that we were at an all - inclusive resort and could not always satiate ourselves at mealtimes and that we managed to come home skinnier than the way we left ( we did enjoy the japanese and mediterranean a la carte restaurants immensely - - - service , quality , and atmosphere were perfect ) ultimately this was a nice resort and they do make every attempt to be of service to their guests , even if it is not 100% what you are used to however i ca not say i would recommend it for anything more than having a place to go where you can lounge by the pool or on the beach and get some sun if you are looking for a place to indulge your tastebuds and have absolute serenity , this is not the place for you 
do not go if your the fun loving type perfect for families we stayed at the hotel july 13 - 28 this hotel is brilliant if you are a family with children under 10 years old , for us ( a couple on our own ) it was boring and offensive the beach is wonderful with beach bars and water sports and water taxis down to the nearby market ( not worth the visit as all haggle stupidly high prices and all sell pretty much the same thing - unless you smoke , ?11 / $20 for 200 is cheaper than the hotels shops ) beach bars unfortunately shut at 4pm and they dont even serve the water after this the room was really nice 7x7 square bed was a nice surprise and the maid kept it clean every day and decorated it with pretty towel art and fresh flowers daily ( we didnt tip her until the end of our holiday and that was of all the change we kept ) we had a few tiny ants but nothing to worry about the air conditioning is brilliant - leave it on all day to walk into a fridge clothes got quite damp though with the humidity , even in the wardrobe the grounds are kept to a very high standard and clean theres a bus that goes up and down from the top to the bottom constantly which was helpful when your a little bit tired it runs all nite too which is helpful if your staying near the beach after a night in the square the pools are really nice and big we found we could get deck chairs around 10am but after 11 youve got no chance pool bars were a great idea the waiters come around the pools , and well everywhere really , asking if you would like a drink , which was really nice - they even bring trolleys with fresh fruit on now and then the fruit is so soft pool entertainment wasnt brilliant , aerobics every day , excercising to the same songs every day which were released about 6 years ago learn salsa dancing - dont bother , you 'll learn three steps on moday , learn the same three steps on the tuesday ( and to the same music ) and same again on wednesday , thursday get my drift we were blessed with the wonderful voice of shakkira and her new album three times every day ( on repeat ) and then to a spanish album , again on repeat the welcoming song you arrive to on the coach soon begins to get under your skin as you hear it at the pools , the beach , the restaurants , the lobby , the bars , and its on the first channel when you turn the tv on you can even learn the dance if you wish ( this would be great for kids ) we saw water polo once and a beer drinking competition but thats all found the entertainment was very disorganised , and worst of all in spanish there was no sort of tanoy telling you what was going on there were a few bulletin boards but they didnt really add up to the activities ( and they didnt say where abouts ) evening entertainment ( again if you have children under 10 they would love it , any age older or a couple like us would find it monotonous , boring and again disorganised they have 12 dancers on every night , pretty much dancing the same dances just to different music its nice to watch for a couple of nights but after 14 it gets boring , they dont even dance in time with each other there was however a brilliant show on a friday night called un todo un poco this was really good - it was a glow in the dark show and was the best show of our holiday the shows however were spoken in spanishfirst ( obviously ) , then in fast broken english , then fast broken french , then fast broken german so it was hard to understand what was going on the barmen/women were really friendly but there is a strong language barrier , if they cant understand you they will move on and ignore you , more than likely to serve a spanish person , which is highly irritating you could be queing and waiting patiently for 10 minutes when a spanish talking person will shout over every one and tell the waiter what they want to drink and that they want to be served next the hotel is extremely spanish orientated , if you are anything but spanish dont bother going we got infuriated to the point that we wanted to leave because of it once we asked for a vodka and orange ( which is pronounced bodka ) and the bloke stated to mop the floor we asked for a coconut liquor and pineapple juice and we got a glass of coke and a glass of pineapple juice made you want to pull your hair out the restaurant meals are nice and the service is to the best of their knowledge ( not up to our english standards but still good ) you do get the feeling however though that the staff are exploited but still loved their jobs the buffets were also good , plenty to go around , however did feel a little concerned about the flys - lots around on the food the hotel have a set routine at night for you to follow : the lobby - where an annoying stevie wonder look - a - like plays the same songs every night in the same order with the same backing music for every single song 7pm -11pmthen you move round to the theatre to watch a show you move to the outdoor square where you can listen to even more spanish music and still not understand what 's going on as it is all in spanish , though you can dance the merengue with a memeber of entertainment staff 10pm -12pmthen you can move on to the disco for two hours of even more spanish music can dance the merengue but a bit faster they will play 1english song for you if they understand you but then its straight back to good old spanish best of all its on for a whole 2 hours 12am -2amif you dont want to do this routine you can go to the karaoke bar , dont think of singing though as the english book has 15 pages with about 8 dvds , of which 4 were broken , scratched or worse - snapped in half thats if the system is working in the first place its open till 2am but you cant sing after midnight as the machine mysteriously stops working you can go to the casino , play on one of the 4 tables and buy your drinks the evening entertainment really dissapointed us we were hoping to have a relaxing day on the beach , fun around the pool , a nice meal and then a night of fun filled entertainment we were let down , we did get a nice day on the beach and a nice meal in nice grounds but not much more overall , we wouldnt go back and we certainly wouldnt reccommend it if you were like us families would be ok wouldnt advise to take teenagers though and as a last message , probably most important of all take lots of anti - diareah tablets with you every thing is made with coconut milk which is a natural laxative 
things have changed at this resort - timeshare clients are number #1 this is our third visit to this resort we are a family of three and travel south at least three times a year we chose the melia caribe tropical again as we enjoyed our previous stays in 2005 and 2007 ( by the way i always said i would not return to any resort - too many others to see ) well this trip we noticed the melia had changed for the worse , very sad grounds are still beautiful and restaurant food still good we are at 6 of the restaurants but the capri ( seafood ) is still the best we noticed changes to the variety and quality of food at the buffets the last two visits to the resort they changed food often , it was always hot and the table service excellent this time not so good very short staffed at this resort staff advised us of layoffs the pool and the beach had floating garbage in them continuously now due to being short staffed they were not cleaned regularly/daily lots of seaweed this time of year and very dirty to enter ocean but much improved further out in the water as for the garbage - can really only blame the vacationers ffor this do you toss your garbage in your own pool or leave on your lawnbed also noticed that by 8 am on both sides of the resort there were no lawnbeds as people claimed them with their towels only and then left for hours some went golfing till 3 pm then dropped by to pick up there stuff signs are posted but this does not stop unfornately this puts a damped on your own attitude as if you want to actually stay at the pool you have to move someones stuff and endure an agrument 5 hrs later when they return sigsn are posted - no reserving - respect the rules like you should just a quick note on the cleanliness of the pool bathrooms and the rooms if you were lucky your room would get a quick clean but you had to wait till the late evening for towels if something in your room did not work like your ac or drain in the tub - no such luck in them fixing ever during your stay we think since this resort is now moving to partial timeshare the staff treat you differently do not pay the extra money for royal service unless you are booking a family suite ( one or two bedroom ) rs junior suites are the same as the regular suites 
indifferent staff do not go to punta cana unless you speak fluent spanish do not go without trip insurance we were unable to arrive at the resort on the original day due to mechanical failure of the aircraft and the inability of the airline to get us to our destination the airline ( us airways ) was most helpful and did all they could to accomodate us including contacting the resort to ensure we could extend our stay as it was over the thanksgiving holiday we had originally booked from saturday returning on wednesday but had to extend to friday as the airlines could not provide a flight on thanksgiving day we arrived to find the resort unwilling to give us any credit for the day we missed and charging us in full for the two additional days in addition , while at the resort we rented the in room safe on the third day we attempted to use the safe only to find it did not work we went to guest relations and told them of our problem they reissued our room keys the next day my husband and son went on an excursion and i went to enjoy the beach the room safe again did not work when my guys returned they found neither of their room keys worked we again went to guest relations and had to argue to get them to reissue working room keys when we checked out and explained the issue of the broken room safe we were met with a shrug and no offer of any kind to credit us this was a piddly $10 us dollars but it was the principle that mattered and showed us more than anything the unwillingness of the resorts in punta cana to extend themselves in anyway to make your vacation enjoyable this is our second and last trip to punta cana we are frequent travelers and love going to the caribbean and have run into issues before we always found if we were reasonable we could expect a reasonable resolution to the problem - except in punta cana i cannot stress enough the need to have at least a good understanding of spanish as very few on the staff we met could speak or understand english even those behind the reception desk and at guest relations had limited understanding of english or the ability to communicate effectively in english 
fun resort my wife and i stayed at the melia caribe tropical during the week of oct 24 and we truly had a great time in the resort we stayed for 7 days our check in was fast and easy i had requested to be close to the beach and pool and they honored it however we did have to change rooms our first room 3406 had problems , the resort however changed our rooms with no problems we had the junior suites , if i go back to this resort ( which i will ) i will opt for the royal service the resort is beautifully landscaped , the restaurants are great and the activities at night are good i walked the beach and noticed that our resort had the most visitors therefore their is more going on at this resort it is family friendly with its own section of the resort dedicated to families with children , ask for the family junior suites you will truly have a great time at this resort if you are looking to get married this would be the resort we saw around 4 weddings during our stay also , we did the safari tour with prieto tours , nice group of guys they will try to accomodate you during your stay in dominican republic 
roach motel we choose the melia tropical a 4 star resort the resort grounds were beatifully manicured , it was a host to may different types of wild life there were flamingos , peacocks , and white egrets all over the property the food and service was very good , the themed restuarants japanese and mediterranean were the best the resort staff were very friendly i was a little irritated at the guys that stop you through out the resort no matter where you are to try to sell you time share it got better , by the 4 day there they left you alone i almost wish there was not going to be a  but but there is this would be a perfect vacation in paradise if you liked sharing your room with roaches yes roaches ( cockaroachus disgusstus ) not the 1/4 ones the 2 giant ones that run fast and fly omg after a long flight you want your first night to be relaxing unfortunately it was the first night that my wife discovered roaches were in the room i killed them but did not sleep much that night worring about my 1 year old son we changed our room first thing the next morning the resort staff were more than happy to accomodate they told us it was probably because we were close to the beach not only will we not return to this resort we will not be traveling to dom its one thing to see roaches on the property but in the rooms is unacceptable at least by my standards 
better choices had read many reviews some good some bad but it fit our budget check in was a night mare we booked rs they say very quick , took well over an hour the help was not overly friendly and seemed bothered they had to work the resort grounds are beautiful and very well kept nice beach , pool area in rs was very nice our room in rs was great , very comfortable bed , great tvs , nice bath and lovley porch the butler service is a joke we never saw him once we were brought to our room we spent most of our days at the pool the service in general was poor i must say the service at the gabbie was always great they really seemed to care and go out of there way but that was the only place we received good service the pool snack bar had the best food of all great chicken , good pizza and ice cream we were a group of 11 and 5 of us got sick from the food at different times during the week the quality of food at all the restaurants we ate at was 3 on a scale of 10 hardly worth the money and very dissapointing all in all i would never recommend this resort to anybody there are far better choices in the dr seems as thought the airport is having growing pains that was also a joke , way to many people for them to handel 
the worst vacation i ever had the only positive thing i can say about this facility is that the grounds are well maintained and now for the bad news : 1 arrival and check - in took 45 minutes no one seemed to know how to use the computer or who was responsible for what room upgrades that we booked were ignored and the # of beds requested were incorrect3 we finally got to room and it took another hour for the bags to arrive dinner reservations were totally frustrating we were told we had no reservation ( even though we called prior and were told we didn?? need to do that until we arrived ) and were sent to the marketplace for dinner the food in this factory style buffet was the qualityof a public school cafeteria you could not eat healthy if you wanted to were told by , a guest relation worker , to confirm flight the following day at 10:30 this was a scam to run us into the vacation club presentation we woke up on our first full day to no running water we called and were told it would be fixed we called again after 40 minutes when no one arrived we went to see another rep at 10:30 to confirm our flight he was not there and we waited 30 minutes for him to show up and then ask us to wait another 15 minutes when he finally sat down , he told us he couldn?? confirm out flight until the day before our departure and proceeded to try to sell us on excursions we were very clear that we were not interested in buying anything further and the sales pitch continued when asked if we had any questions we expressed that our lack of water was still and issue and he advised up to call the 3000 number which we told him we called twice already he made no other effort to assist us and we were then ushered out by guest relation workerand put on a golf cart we were then taken to a vacation club meeting and were told by guest relation workerthat we need to sit for 20 minutes even though the paper said 90 so he could get his points and we would get 50 00 to spend we told him we weren?? interested in the club but at that point thought we could get someone?? attention about the water if we went in the guest relation worker said that if we sat with the rep he would call a manager about the water so we did sit there and then told the female rep about the problem without hesitation she went on with the sales pitch another male rep was sent over and we told him we were not interested in buying a club membership he apologized about our bad experiences thus far and inquired how much we paid for our vacation he then proceeded to walk us over to a gallery of pictures ( the founder and all the other melia resorts around the world ) he the asked , ??ow would like to spend less on our vacation next time to which i responded , ??ill my room have water i then told him outright how aggravated i was that the beginning of my first vacation day was taken up by these sales antics he then summoned two managers who we told how disappointed we were in our first day?? stay we alerted them about the water and then and only then after going through the 3000 number twice , guest relation worker , the rep from hotel beds , the female rep , the male rep did they offer to call to see to the problem we were in the midst of other vacationers receiving the sales pitch and i believe their interest was in shutting us up as to not allow the others to see our dissatisfaction we left and walked back to our room ( no one offered to escort us and they had to the sales promotion ) and miraculously the problem had been rectified by this time it was almost 2pm specialty restaurants the food was terrible the menus did not make sense why in an italian restraint would you not have parmesan cheese on the tables since when is brie cheese an italian appetizer the seafood that was offered seemed frozen the desserts were definitely frozen and thawed , sometimes not even all the way in the french restaurant i ordered a spinach role and was served a soggy plate of green slop swimming in cream presentation and especially taste were appalling the bars were under - stocked and under manned at the pool bar the soda fountains on the upper level did not work every time you ordered a soda they would have to go down to the bottom pool level to retrieve it ??hey did not stock basic things like cranberry or orange juices only offered presidente beer ??artenders would ignore you unless you put tip money on the bar before service bartenders did not know how to make basic drinks i received a cosmopolitan at the bar by the mexican restaurant in a glass with salt around the rim as if i had ordered a margherita i thought it was a mistake so i reordered the drink to get another the same way the only way to get service was to show the tips and no one would make change i was told by the front desk , guest services , the store and the bartenders they could not make change for a 20 dollar bill the only way to get change was at the casino and for that you had to get chips in order to get any service you had to put a tip out which should not be the case any decent percent would tip for good service rendered this resort seemed to work in reverse no one answered a question directly and we were sent to person after person to make a dinner reservation was extremely frustrating in order to get one you had to call no later than 11 am and the staff would rush you off the phone mid question i was hung up on twice in mid sentence my husband and i were celebrating our 13 wedding anniversary adn were profoundly disappointed in this trip it was frustrating and i had a stress headache for the 9 days we were there my advice is go to the bahamas where people are glad to see you , friendly , hand you a drink upon arrival and tell you to relax because you 're on vacation 
bumps along the way but enjoyed - royal service was key there were some bumps along the way , but overall we enjoyed our stay 5/21-5/25 we are in our mid 30?? and went for our anniversary we opted for royal service which i think was well worth it and made the difference in our experience the place is exceptionally large and beautiful i ca not say enough about the grounds and first class atmosphere however , the food and service was good to great depending and could use improvement rs check in went smooth and they were very helpful since we missed our entire first day due to the airline they upgraded us complimentary to a suite which was very nice be sure to tell the driver royal service so you get off on the second stop the room was a bit musty at first , but nothing a travel candle couldn?? fix bottled water , rum , and soft drinks were provided in the room after a few attempts we stopped trying to call our butler and just called the rs number for things only once did we have a problem with dinner reservations but we called after 2 and got in with no problem ( thanks rs ) the water and sand were spectacular the rs beach had seaweed , but the bali beds and bar service were great there weren?? any floats to use in the water the water was clearer in the regular beach area i did notice people reserving spots on the beach and by the pool , but that?? everywhere we ate at the seafood , american , dominican , and gabi restaurants i think the seafood restaurant was the best and the grill near the beach was awful the best meals and service by far were at dinner lunch at gabi was great , but the poolside snacks need some improvement breakfast at the marketplace was great too , but service was sometimes lacking everyone was friendly , but sometimes the staff would totally ignore you without saying a word other times , you couldn?? even get your request out before they were trying to help also , the vacation salespeople were really a pain a firm no is the only way to deal with them we enjoyed the nighttime entertainment but it?? not exactly a night on the town if that?? what you??e looking for drinks/bars were great although i did notice during the day they seemed to use the same slushy mix in several drinks as another poster complained we didn?? mind the train but with rs we rode mainly in the golf carts we did the stingray bay/carnival festival excursion and highly recommend it having been back a month , i don?? think this place was as bad as others made it out to be in fact , i think it has awesome potential i would recommend only going royal service to make sure you get the better experience i don?? think i?? return until the service and food improved from good to great to match its beauty btw - my husband got sick our last full day and had to see a doctor when we returned he?? gotten sick from most of our trips to the caribbean but this was the worst be sure to take the necessary precautions 
average all inclusive we just returned from our stay with melia caribe tropical (05/24/08 through 06/01/2008) upon arrival we checked in on the tropical side the overall process was a little slow and we had to remind the representative to give us our all inclusive bracelet not a big deal but did leave us with a questionable first impression if interested , the hotel has representatives at every location ready to speak with you about time share opportunities we managed to avoid the small talk with a simple but stern no thank youthe grounds are beautiful lush tropical plants , flamingos and peacocks just to name a food the only downside is the side is the size of the grounds bring comfortable shoes as you have to walk everywhere or wait 15 - 20 minutes for the trolley to take you around the restaurants we chose for dinner did not disappoint we visited the mexican , american , japanese and mediterranean the breakfast buffett offered daily by the beach was your typical buffet the menu stayed the same each day the bartenders at the resort were friendly and attentive the selection of alcohol available was mostly well brands with a few select name brands to chose from was a little boring to not have more optionsthe beach is nice but had a lot of grass from the sea on the beach and in the water during our stay overall , this is a value all inclusive resort and we received what we expected for the price paid 
will not be going back while we did not have a miserable time , i found this resort to be severely lacking in quality of product and service the hotel and restaurants are beautiful , but the grounds definetely were in need of landscaping or of being watered at the very least the food was in abudance , but did not taste good , all the meals were just okay only one type of beer - presidente is served , and only one bartender at the pool bar and no waiter service at bar or beach no bar at beach at all it seems that the hotel is understaffed as there were only two front desk clerks to check guests in , and after waiting 45 minutes for that to happen , were not greeted warmly or offered an apology waiters at restaurants also served as bus boys room was very sparsely decorated and outdated , but bed was comfortable enough resort was too large and you had to rely on trains to go to lobby or restaurants from your room as it was too hot and far to walk 
ok - but royal service not worth it overall the melia is a beautiful hotel - the grounds and main areas are gorgeous lots of wildlife everywhere - peacocks , flamingos the rooms , however , are outdated and need a major overall the royal service rooms are the same - need a major renovation just so other guests are prepared there are bugs the couple we were travelling with had a very big cockroach in their room the first night we know this is normal in the carribean but we have been to cuba twice , mexico once , and this is the first time we have seen a cockroach in the room if you are not prepared for this then be advised the hotel is big and somewhat noisy even from your rooms , you can hear music playing the hotel is essentially a family hotel , so if you do not have children , this can be very annoying even in the royal service area , there were lots of kids the resort is big - not as big as some people were making it out to be on this site - the walk from the royal suites to the beach was about 5 minutes max the walk may be a problem for some - but the average person should have no complaints we even saw a peacock and her babies one day there are rides available for those who want it - we never had a problem the beach was ok - cuba beaches are better lots of seaweed ( which did not bother us but may bother others ) there is not a lot of shade , even in the royal suites section on the beach we went to the beach in the afternoon because that was the only time you were guaranteed shade the royal service side has a bar right on the beach which was very nice the other side does not have a beach bar ( you have to walk to the pool area ( which may be annoying for some ) the vendors on the beach are an absolute pain and they are the #1 reason why we will never go back to the dominican they are annoying and demanding and a nuisance they will walk beside you on the beach until you agree to go to their shop ( at that moment ) or you get rude and tell them to get lost further , the vendor prices are outrageous so high that i cannot even understand the reasoning for this approach further , the prices are so inconsistent - the same necklace could be $12 dollars at one stand and $22 dollars at another stand 50 feet away my advice , buy all souvenirs at the gift shop or the mall cheaper prices and better quality unfortunately , there are no romantic walks on this beach the beach next to the melia and paradisus is public and not clean - there is garbage everywhere ( wear shoes ) the food is very good in all the restaurants and the royal suites restaurant that said , both my husband and i are suffering from a major stomach bug ( unfortunately , to be expected , especially when the water is not safe to drink and you are eating at buffets ) though we did not drink the water , you cannot always be sure with the food preparation the service was good in the restaurants and bars - forget tipping because the service does not change - - believe me a dollar goes nowhere at this resort - maybe $10 or $20 dollars apparently , this is the same everywhere in the dr one of our tour guides ( outback safari ) basically told us that a $1 tip goes nowhere because of the rate of inflation - we thought that was a bit rude the maid service ( even in the royal service ) sucked , even when you tipped if you managed to get service , it was minimal at best the royal service guests are supposed to get turn down service - we got it twice without calling the rest of the time we had to call and demand it we were not pleased overall , if you are looking for the royal service or the extra service do not go to this hotel the royal service is a waste of money if you choose royal service demand that you are put in the royal suites area - we were put in villa 44 which is technically the caribe the overflow of royal suites guests are put in there - there are no king beds , and you do not get the royal maid service at all - the four of us demanded that we be moved to the royal service area and we managed to get the rooms on the third day this is not acceptable given the extra money you are paying we have stayed at the palladium in the royal section and the sandals cuba vip and the service was much , much better do not waste your money in this hotel - - it is not worth it 
hotel wonderful experience horrible we stayed at the melia caribe tropical from april 17 to april 22 2008 the hotel was probably one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever stayed in however u must be aware of sickness my husband  i went w/our 3 children age 9, 6 2 myself my oldest and middle child got violently ill the last two days of trip so bad we ended up in the hospital w/dehydration 103 5 fever chills vomitting diarhhea u name it we had it it was all supposedly from the pool water which is not cleaned w/chlorine and considering my husband and my 2 year old did not go in the pool i believe that 's what it was it is a very poor country and very very unsanitary the hospital was frightening no one spoke a word of english so needless to say the hospital stay was not a good one my 2 year old picked up a contact dermatitis from the towels or sheet we do not know what he was covered in red hives all over his face neck and arms we travel quite a bit to the caribbean and we never ever had such a horrible experience as this trip we will never leave the country again and if we do we will never ever ever go to the dominican republic again 
very disappointed punta cana , dominican republic : melia caribe tropical - very disappointeddate : april 2008review : this was my first and last trip to this resort when i was booking my room at this resort i found that if i paid extra i could have a room in the royal service area which offers additional amenities it is a waste of your money to go with royal service when i arrived it was not until i approached someone before they began assigning my room and the rooms of the other people i was traveling with i requested a pool side view and the room was facing the pool but it was nowhere in view the royal service area is located to far from the beach you can take a trolley car if you do not mind waiting 5 to 20 minuets or you can walk 15 minuets in the hot sun in my room the first thing i saw was a basket of fruit that was left there from the previous guest the lady who was supposed to clean my room would only clean it once a day at 4:30 in the afternoon and she would not replace items used such as coffee creamer if i wanted to take more than one shower a day i had to reused my towel in the bathroom i plugged in my blow dryer ( i rather use mine ) and when i went to unplug it the whole socket came out of the wall neither me nor my husband could figure out why we could set the clock in the room and if we left the room and returned the clock would be blinking as if they lost power the others in my party also had this problem my son - in - law and daughter had a room next to me and when my son - in - law was is his bathroom he saw what he thought was dirt on the floor so he brushed it with his barefoot to find that it was not dirt but a rusted screw ( where a door stopper used to be ) which pierced his toe so my daughter called the front desk and reported the problem where they offered no medical care my daughter was told that the maintenance man would be there to repair the problem after three days of calling the problem was never repaired my other daughter and her boyfriend also had problems in they room first problem was when the boy friend remove the towel from the rack in the bathroom to dry his face and the whole rack came off the wall the next thing for them was their air conditioner was leaking water on the floor so they went to the front desk to report it the good thing was they upgraded them to a suite no complaints there i found the worst thing about this place was this salesman kept at us to purchase time share i mean every time i went to return a pool towel he was there to brother us i kept telling him no thank you then he called my room to ask us to meet him i said sorry not interested the worst was when he showed up at my room and had the maid knot on my door when i opened it he was behind her and again was asking to talk to us at this point we were very angry so i just shut the door this was our vacation excursions : be careful some of them take only cash they tell you the ride takes 15 minuets to get to your excursion when it took one hour and 10 minuets in a open cattle truck if you use your charge card make sure your credit card company does not charge to convert the peso restaurants : we ate french at ma maison which was great , el guarapo dominican very very slow service , hokkaido japanese another good one but the hardest to get reservation in la pagoda very very slow and not very good the grounds were nice but still under construction a lot of paths were mud my husband was walking to dinner , through a path that was not lit up or roped off but was very muddy dew to sprinklers and he ended up twisting his ankle overall it really was not what we anticipated and will not return 
do not expect peace and quiet so many kids , , , the resort was beautiful and the villa and room were quite nice the service was top of the line for the royal service guests i had heard some bad reviews about the food but honestly it was not that bad the mexican restaurant was fresh and delicious , you could skip the seafood and japanese all together nothing but good things to say about the gabi - royal service restaurant , breakfast , lunch and dinner buffet were top of the line my complaints are only about the placement of families and children with three days left to my trip the hotel placed a family of four next door to me , to say the noise level was about average would be a small understatement i would think that they would have an area for families with small children seperate from the adult guests i was under the impression from my travel agent that the resort , and the royal service area was geared more towards adults and couples the royal service pool area was crawling with children from open to close i enjoyed the resort over all but have had better experiences i honestly would try something else next time 
our experience at the melia caribe my girlfriend and i recently went to the melia caribe from sept 9th - 14th after reading numerous reviews ( and watching the weather channel prior to leaving ) , i have to say we were a bit nervous about our upcoming trip but hopefully this review will answer a few of your questions if you are headed to the resort and you will find it helpful i 'll try to cover as much as i can , so you are as informed as you can be first off , i booked the trip through the hotel website ( solmelia sol melia resorts actually offers a low - price online guarantee , and booking was easy and not a problem the only thing you need to be aware of when booking through the hotel website is that they will not charge your credit card when you make your reservation they charge your card when you check into the hotel based on the reviews here on tripadvisor we decided to get the royal service master suite we flew out of atlanta to the dominican republic on delta airlines they offer flights twice a week , so your stay will typically be at least a few days you 'll arrive at the dominican republic airport and you walk from the plane into the terminal you 'll have to wait in line as you enter the terminal because they take your picture and then on your flight out they have it up on the wall in case you want to buy it after you clear the photo op , you 'll have to open up your wallet or purse , and pay $10 per person for a tourist entry card it is completely meaningless - - - - not a visa or anything , but the dr is a poor country and charge everyone ten dollars just to get in once you get your bags , you 'll be swarmed by baggage handlers who are very eager to grab your bags and take them to an awaiting taxi word of advice - - - carry your own bags it is only a short walk to the taxi areas and you do not know what can happen to your bags if you let someone else take them from you taxis are lined up outside the terminal do not accept a standard price from taxi drivers - - bargain them down most will take you to your resort for $20 ( they typically start at $25) the drive to the melia caribe is boring , so do not bother pulling out your camera once we arrived , we showed the baggage handler our reservation and he took us to the royal service lounge / reception area the staff in the royal service lounge is very nice they present you with drinks when you come in and immediately get you checked into your room at the lounge you are introduced to your personal butler , who takes care of everything from there our butler was pablo , and he was great for the duration of our stay your butler will drive you to your room , unload your baggage , show you how to work the safe , and then leave you alone to enjoy your vacation if you are looking for a great butler , ask for pablo our room was nice , but the bed is not the most comfortable in the world it was not very supportive and actually slightly bowed in the middle the bathroom situation is pretty wierd ( as it is next to the shower and pretty much in view of the entire room ) , so if you are not comfortable with the bathroom habits of your wife/girlfriend/family member , you will be by the time you get done with your trip the jacuzzi in the master suite is nice , and your butler will get it filled up and ready to go by whatever time you like we had pablo take care of our jacuzzi tub twice during our stay and it was great i 'd recommend bringing a citronella candle that will last you the week ( or some bug spray ) because the mosquitos will be in your room every night if you do not have anything the maids clean your room every day and restock your fridge the room service menu is very limited they have a few sandwiches , small pizzas , and waters/sodas , and that is it so do not expect a full - blown menu the royal service villas are right next to the gabi restaurant and the royal service pool the pool is great and is surprisingly very clean i actually swam around the pool with goggles and was pretty shocked to see how clean it was the pool is great and has plenty of private cabanas if you need some shade from the sun my girlfriend and i spent most of our time at the beach , which was awesome white sand beaches , clear turquoise water it really did not get much better we had fantastic weather during the week we were there ( even though the weather channel forecasted rain all week ) the beach drink/wait staff was not too great , but they will give you towels , get your drinks , and for the most part they leave you alone beach activities are plentyful , but everything costs money ( even the so - called free activities ) we went snorkeling with sharks , and it was a great afternoon activity stick to the beach if you are looking for a relaxing time , with family or friends up to this point i really have not had any complaints about the resort , and you 're probably wondering why i only gave the melia caribe three stars my biggest complaint is the food the restaurants are really sad in terms of selection , quality of food , and variation of menus even the gabi restaurant , which is supposed to be the best on on the resort , is pretty sad the service is very good , but the food just is not that great do not expect gourmet meals anywhere you go about the only restaurant that i even thought was ok was the mexican food restaurant , la hacienda drinks are also pretty bland/weak , with not much alcohol content the wine is not great either i actually felt bad because a lot of the waiters will actually ask you if they can do anything to make your dining experience better , but the quality of food is just sub - par so overall , the experience that my girlfriend and i had at the melia caribe tropical was good it was a very relaxing vacation for the two of us and the resort is beautiful be prepared not to eat too well , and you 'll be just fine i hope this review helped you to plan your visit , and enjoy your trip 
lovely location - poor resort myself and my husband have just arrived back from dominican republic we stayed at the all inclusive melia caribe tropical in punta cana although we had an enjoyable holiday this was not down to the resort the room was shabby ( a deluxe junior suite supposedly ) , the food was awful ( mostly buffet and snack food available ) , and they served bottom class alcohol ( which was included in the price aswell ) although the staff were friendly and helpful , they became very rude if you did not want to buy what they were selling or said no when offered information on various activities also , alot of the staff in the resort were sales people for their vacation club and we found ourselves railroaded into the information tour for signing up for the club like i said it is very very hard to say no to them another point was that in this all inclusive resort all non motorised water sports were supposed to be included although they are free the lessons / training on how to use the equipment before doing the activity are quite expensive and you do start to feel slightly ripped off 
call your travel agent immediately first of all i??e stayed in many dr resorts ( riu palace , caribe club princess twice , palladium bavaro twice , sunscape punta cana grande , ifa villas bavaro etc i even stayed the week before at a wonderful 4 star resort in mexico before traveling to the dr my resort choices over the years range in their ratings from 3 stars to 6 stars i have also visited all - inclusives all over the caribbean i??e been faithful to apple vacations because their apple ratings are usually accurate and our experiences in the resorts have been relatively flawless and enjoyable something usually isn?? perfect but we take the bad and are able to make the best of it in most cases i always write a review and this review will be the first negative trip review for me i stayed at the melia caribe tropical several years ago and had a pretty flawless stay i hated the beach restaurants at that time but was able to find great buffets and restaurants in other areas of the resorts i also read the other reviews regarding this resort on tripadvisor and chalked poor reviews up to picky patrons who couldn?? be satisfied anywhere please reread those negative reviews i was wrong if you have not taken your vacation yet , please call your travel agent right away and change resorts we traveled to this alleged five star resort on july 6, 2007 check in - surprisingly and contrary to other reviews , they allowed us to check in early right upon arrival resort appearance - the resort looks great in pictures and in person the greenery , buildings , lobby and beach are still great to look at now for the very bad 1 extremely aggressive timeshare people in yellow shirts harass you in the lobby on the train , in the restaurants , on the beach they are everywhere and are a nuisance from the moment that you walk through the lobby we hated them and the last thing we wanted to do was buy a timeshare in that awful resort the room - the jr suite that we received looked nothing like the internet pics and did not resemble the nicer room that i had last time i did see rooms like i had before but we weren?? placed in one for some reason the furniture was somewhat worn and had a butlers pantry instead of a seating area i noticed little black bugs on the counters and in the bathroom but i attributed them to the fresh flowers and threw them out we were never able to get rid of the bugs during our stay they resembled ants but were smaller lack of food - they tell you to call the reservation hotline to reserve ala carte restaurants for the current day and the following day they forgot to say that no one ever answers that hotline it rings repeatedly , stays busy or when they do answer , they say ??e are all booked up ??lease call back later to check for cancellations or book for the next day after calling many times , we were unable to book a restaurant for our arrival day or the next day we gave up and went to the beach we tried the beach grill but there were few choices and lots of greasy snack bar foods plain pans of rice with a few carrots plain pans of fish , chicken or pork desserts were limited out there and it was hot in that beach grill the tables have no linen table cloths and your dishes will pile up because service is poor to non - existent in there i mistakenly reassured my husband that they had other restaurants that i enjoyed last time in the morning , they didn?? even have pans of scrambled eggs , pancakes or waffles isn?? that standard the omelet line is so long in the morning , you wouldn?? want an egg poor service - after spending a pretty great first day on the beach , we returned to our room only to find that we had no water coming into the bathtub/shower we called the desk for assistance but no one came after waiting for about 1 hour still no answer on that reservation hotline either we took off in search of restaurants we saw beautiful ala cartes with well dressed people who seemed satisfied but we found no buffets we saw signs for the buffets and looked on our resort map but still found no buffets finally we were informed that they have torn all of the buffet restaurants down and we discovered lots of construction finally we went to the front desk to again complain about the water/food issues we were tired , dirty and simply needed food surely they could have secured a restaurant reservation for us those restaurants were not full we were simply given the hotline number again and were told that the buffets from the past no longer existed the signs were wrong to make matters worse i detected an attitude from the lady at the front desk instead of sympathy the only place to eat is that awful , hot beach grill if you are unable to secure a reservation that grill would be used for all meals having no choice , we walked back to the beach grill to head off starvation the room shower was repaired finally but still had very little water pressure the next morning i tried the restaurant hotline again and managed to get a voice everything was booked for our second day already the thought of another day in that beach grill sickened me we were able to book a reservation for the japanese restaurant on the third day , however , we were told that we would have to stop what were doing in the middle of the day and pick up a ticket at the restaurant or we would not be admitted we were also told that we could call back to check on restaurant cancellations after 2:30 p we then noticed water all over the floor of the bathroom on the second day the toilet had suddenly sprung a leak i was also beginning to experience flu/viral symptoms that would plague me for the remainder of the week i could have contracted the illness on the plane but you never know i was able to live with the symptoms all week but it definitely put a damper on some activities spending the vacation on the phone dialing a hotline morning , afternoon and night and walking to various restaurants to pick up tickets was not how i planned to spend my week i also refused to watch hundreds of people enjoying the very upscale ala cartes while i stayed in the beach grill i lost all sense of calm and headed to the lobby to find the apple vacations rep who normally is stationed in the lobby of the hotel we found that he would be off for a couple of days i then went to guest services and requested that apple vacations be called 
beautiful grounds and beach but just returned from a 7 night stay at the melia caribe tropical with my family of 4 and extended family and friends for a total of 21 people trip was great but with a few problems first - check in was not a problem - breezed through within 1/2 hour and were served cool drinks while waiting for the rest of our party to finish luggage was delivered promptly to our room but upon arrival we discovered that in order to get the power on in the room you need to insert a room card into the slot - ask for an extra one upon arrival so that you can leave it in while out of the room as it also controlled my a/c my friends and sister did not have this problem but just to be sure get an extra one just in case second - the beach is beautiful and although there is sea - grass floating it is raked daily there are plenty of grass huts to lay under - try to get one as the sun is strong the pool area is well - maintained but guests do tend to litter their cups and straws also we saw several babies in diapers and some naked in the pool which led to us seeing some excrement in the pool the staff does come around and clean up the pool all day long and we did notice that it seemed well chlorinated in the evening third - dinner reservations are really a pain and require some creative planning - we actually had to call home to ask our travel agent to book some for us because it was impossible unless we wanted to eat at 9:45 each night if we were lucky enough to even get into a restaurant i realize that booking for 21 people may seem difficult but when we noticed the many empty tables where we did eat it made me wonder we did run into a vacation club member who told us that there are tables held for royal service guests and vacation club members and if they do not cancel the tables go unused and others cannot get in there is construction ongoing in the tropical lobby area and one evening while dining in the international restaurant the a/c went out and it was about 100 degrees inside and we did not even have our dinner yet we finally got our dinner at 11:45 pm after listening to the dinner cleanup in the kitchen and finding out that several guests took their meals into the adjoing thai restaurant this was not offered to us and we would have left but by that time the buffet was closed and we would not have been able to eat i know this seems like a long review but i wanted my fellows travelers to be aware of the potential problems all in all the good outweighed the bad but i would suggest if possible to try the royal service - they seemed to have perfected that service 
plop plop fiz fiz just returned from a week july 4th -11th with a group of 11 this is a honest review from a new jersey native check in - very very slowarrived at 2pm with nobody on line and it took well over 35 minutes to check in , quickly the line built to over a hour wait with just 5 people in line i asked for a close room to the beach and was granted this place is huge so it was a minute walk to the pool , beach , buffet , but a very long walk to the sit down resturants and the lobby where the bars and shows are held they have a train that comes buy every 15 minutes , but never waited , i walked the pools - very large and never crowed they have 2, one on the tropical side , and one on the caribe side getting chairs was never a problem getting a unbrella after 10am could be tough though they have a pool bar at each pool never a wait to get a drink the beach - very large white sand beach with plenty of chairs , and never crowed getting a shade umbrella was tough after 10am they have all kinds of watersports availble the only free ones included were the paddleboat and canoes get them early seaweed - never a problem its actually little twiggs that float at different parts of the beach and wash up after a full day never a problem with swimming its not the green seaweed you think it is they pick it all up after dark so its clean in the am the room - average sized room with a couch and a little patio includes a mini fridge , whichthey stock with water and soda at no charge leave the maid a small tip if you would like extra room has a small safe also the hotel - very very very pretty , beautifully landscaped grounds eveywhere peacocks roam free everywhere the resturants - you have a choice of 2 buffet and nine sit down the buffets serve breakfast and lunch and afternoon snacks one serves dinner the nine resturants were all above average with good food you have to call the night before from 9-11pm to make reservations for the following night , no exceptions you can were shorts , both men and women men cannot wear open toe sandles they will turn you away beware the service is extremly slow only had trouble getting into the japanese resurant whick cooks hibatchi style on my second to last night i got help from the hotess who got me in for my last night i tipped her nicely for the help that is the only place that is hard to get in because of the good food and small amount of space they open the mexican for late nite snacks bars - plenty of bars all around with good drinks , unlimited bottled water free of charge you can order anything you want including wine and shots great service from all if you tipped or did not will also fill any mugs you may bring along with no problem lobby bars close at 12am , then you have to move to the disco for drinks till 4am the disco was empty most of the time music not that good entertainment - lacking - - - they have nothing to do during the day , they have a water arobics class for about twenty minutes , and some vollyball on the beach the kids have a flintstone camp that might keep your little ones happy for a few days they have nightly shows at 10pm which are pretty good , then some live music till 12am the negatives - - - - - sick sick sick my whole group of 11 americans got the runs after returning back some of us had it mid week for a day or two took pepto which quickly stopped it we all still have gas and the runs 5 days later one of the kids aged 15 caught a viral infection , and was in the hospital with a 104 fever a day after returning her face is numb on oneside , and will remain for 4-6 weeks doctor said it was caught from the water , or the food we all avoided the salad , friut though we did not get sick during the trip , and with the misfortune of the child falling ill the trip was good we all new ahead of time that we could get sick , we went to punta cana fully prepared i would not return to the dominican republic any questions feel free to ask 
this is the honest review you need to read first i want to say hello to our new friends angela and donald we had a great time with you guys we arrived at this resort on tuesday july 3rd and stayed until sunday the 8th my husband and i have traveled all over the carribean lucia ( sandals ) jamaica ( sandals ) , nassau ( breezes ) st thomas , antiqua , turks and caicos , grand caymen , st maarten , mexico ( cancun and playa del carmen - adventura spa palace and royal hideaway ) not that any of you care about this but just that it hopefully will make you pay attention to this review first let me say we are not snobs and just like decent accomodations and drinks with a nice beach and pool as well as a nice atomosphere basically we are not that hard to please good rooms - the rooms are nice , spacious and clean and the resort is very pretty a bit big but pretty if you like to get a little bit of exercise you really can walk everywhere we stayed in building #38 and walked everyday to the beach and pool which maybe took 7 minutes not a big deal if you want to be near the pool ask for building #26 as the pool is right behind it beach and pools - great beach and pool nice white sand and clear water and several very big pools lots of room to swim never seemed overly crowded , not so good the food at the buffets was really not that great edible yes but good no the drinks at the bar if you like frozen drinks were awful to the point were i had to drink beer all week some of the ala carte resteraunts were decent but again not great our best meal was at the international resteraunt the capri was ok and i the japenese steakhouse is suppossed to be good remember you have to call after 9pm for the next day reservations if you call and it rings and rings hang up and call back ( youll most likely get a busy ) but if you hang up again and call back someone usually answers ( strange i know but it seemed to work as i was able to get through and make reservations every night ) this hotel caters to family and kids if has a ton to do for kids but if your looking for a romantic getaway this is not the place the service also was less then stellar which made me think we should have done the royal service i would give this resort overall a 3 to 3 5 stars but it is not 4 or 5 due to the drinks/food the resort is pretty enough but it really lacks in this area if you are a family and want to travel with your kids and have fun and do not care that much about food this is the place for you hope this helps any questions you can email me at sandycrowley2878@yahoo 
nightmare in melia we just go back from melia caribe tropical in punta cana and what a nightmare it was i 'll start with the positive the weather was beautiful , the beach and pools are gorgeous and very clean , and the activity men on the beach that give dance lessons and do areobic exercises were very friendly , nice , and fun other than that our vacation was awful for the most part the food is edible , but not good and it made the majority of my family sick it is almost impossible to get dinner reservations they allow you to call between9-11pm the night before and 2-4 pm the day of and no matter what timeyou call , everything is booked we were a party of 9, but i always made it clear that we can be split into parties of 2, and it was still difficult by 9:15 pm ( it took 15 minutes to get through with all the busy signals ) everything was booked so i would have to leave the beach everyday and walk back to my room to call at 2 pm hoping for a cancellation i later found out from my tour guide that they hold x amount of tables for people staying on the royal service side and they do not book all of the tables in each restaurant for lack of waiters one woman i spoke to told me she gave the reservation guy $50 and he got her into the japanese restaurant for the following day the japanese restuarant is the most popular and difficult to get into because the food is that good but when i askedthe guy if i could reserve japanese for the following night , he told me the computer does not allow him to so this resort is run on money and lies my room never had maid service before 7 pm so there were no towels to shower with to get to dinner we had to call the front desk and argue to get towels they would finally arrive after about 40 minutes and the maid would get to our room after we left for dinner i later found out that my sister - in - law would hand the maid $5 each morning and she was given an endless supply of towels and had her room made up early every morning also , you should know that men need to wear closed toed shoes and collared shirts to get into all of the restaurants or they will not be served my dad and brothers learned this the hard way it cost $10per person to get into the country and $20 per person to get out find out if your travel agent covers this overall , this resort was more concerned with its rules then customer satisfaction it is a huge resort with a lot of walking they have a train service , but it runs every 20 minutes and follows a specific route , so i noticed it 's quicker to walk i complained to one of the guest service men about all of the walking from my room to both lobbies and he told me that i knew it was a big resort so i should not have come these people are extremely rude and unaccommodating and lack decent communication skills be prepared for a major run around i would advise you not to vacation to this resort if you 're looking for something relaxing and enjoyable 
the good , the bad and the ugly we have just returned from a stay at the melia from june 24- july 1 we were a group of 10 and had a great time in spite of the melia check in was frustrating because we tried to get 4 rooms close together and close to the beach and pool we had two rooms in building 10 and two rooms in building 12 both were perfect locations and we were pleased with that the rooms were average but the main problem was the air conditioning it did not work great and was very rarely confortable in the room also it was a great tip to put a card in the slot to keep air conditioning running while out of the room but be aware that on the rare occasion that maid service comes in they will pull the card out and turn off the ac in the week that we were there we only had maid service 3 times and the third time my husband had to call the supervisor to get it if they do come they take the towels and dont leave new ones of course you wont know this until you get out of the shower one day we started calling for towels at 4:00 and were still calling at 12:00a m until they were finally delivered the service was horrible not only was maid service bad but the service in the restaurants was very slow one night in the american grill we waited 2 hours for a hamburger i feel the service everywhere in the resort left alot to be desired the food was pretty good and the buffets had something for everyone at night we ate at the ala carte rest and they were pretty good the japanese was the best food we were so hot we started picking restaurants with the best air conditioning ( the dominican rest it is so hot this time of year so we were in the water all day the beach and pool we beautiful with plenty of chairs we did get up early to get a hut on the beach - they are all gone by 7:00 a it is really beautiful that time of the day so we didnt mind the non motorized water sports like the bikes were free of charge but had to make a reservation my son took a windsurfing lesson for $25 00 and was told that was the only charge and he would be able to use it free for the rest of the week not true - $5 00 waiver fee every time used the resort was beautiful but too large for our taste we were lucky that our rooms were close to everything but i really felt sorry for the people who had to take a train just to get to the pool , beach or restaurants the main lobby and bar areas were very pretty but it was so hot and there were no fans that they were hard to enjoy the casino served its purpose and provided us with lots of fun and a cool place to have a drink overall we had a great time and thought the place was beautiful we would not go back because of the service and the extremely large size of the resort helpful hints for travel : luggage can only weigh 50 lbs ( did not know this and was shifting weight in my suitcases at the check in counter ) also , if you buy mamajuana ( a local drink ) to bring home buy the already mixed kind not just the bottle with the herbs and roots in it ( you will see what i mean when you get there ) they will not let you through customs unless already mixed 
beautiful pool and beaches my family was there from april 19 to 25th , 2007 everyone is always excited at the start of a vacation so , you step off the plane with your custom paper filled out ( because you received it on the airline and had time to fill out one per family ) and walk into the terminal where you wait in line for a long time ( depending how many planes land at one time ) to pay $10 per person to enter the country , then are told you need a custom paper per person and the official then asks you for $5 - which i did not pay reading previously that it is a scam , nor did i fill out the extra custom papers i had arranged for a taxi ( rafael silva ) to pick us up - which was great he was waiting and brought us directly to the hotel he was also timely to pick us up for our return flight the good and the bad : we arrived at the hotel before anyone else from the airport and no one was in line to check in i was thinking what luck , this will be quick i booked direct through sol melia , i had an email confirmation ( in english and in spanish ) of the price and kind of room i was to receive they tried to charge me $1000 more than what my email said , this took over an hour to work out i get to the room which was to have 2 queen beds a twin with a trundle and a pull out sofa instead it had 2 full size ( this is questionable very small ) and a twin bed and a hard not pull out sofa well i tried to call but the phone did not work the phone was fixed 2 days later and many trips to the from desk to complain i was able to get extra sheets and pillows from our housekeeper and a trundle was under the twin bed 2 days before we were going to check out it rained very heavy one night and the roof leaked right over the bed do not worry it stops leaking when it stops raining the shower leaked and flooded the bathroom during every shower and the cord to dry your bathing suits on was missing i do not think that the bugs people saw were cockroaches i believe they were palmetto bugs which are similiar - whatever the are we had just one our room was located near the pool and one of the buffets and near a train stop so that was all good i wish i had asked for another room key because in order to have the fan and airconditioner on you needed to leave a key in the wall , but housekeeping pulls it out when they come in so when you come back all hot and sticky your room is hot too people also wrote about theft - we did not experience any problems and there were guards everywhere around the resort i felt very secure the time share people are very annoying and you have to be nasty with them to go away but then they do for the number of people there the pool is nearly empty so the kids had plenty of room to swim and play good luck trying to get a cabana the bartender at the swim up bar remembers what you like and how you like it which is really great the beach is one of the nicest i have ever been to they clean the seaweed each morning they need more non paying water sports that are open the food left much to be desired we ate at the japanese , french , and international which were all very good the mexican was okay the capri smelled fishy as soon as you walk in and food was just okay chinese was terrible reservations are a joke you call and call and can never get the time of the restaurant you want but if you are there for a week you can usually get into all of them we ate at the buffet by the pool for breakfast and lunch most everyday there were a lot of choices so you should be able to find something you like the paella was really good for a change of pace we did try the italian buffet for lunch one day there were a few different choices there and it was airconditioned and closed in so you did not have to fight off the flies if you live in the us and are use to airconditioning it is not the same here at all just remember there is no room service at this hotel and they definately cater to the people who purchase rs none of these things ruined out trip but you go an vacation to relax you hope for less problems i would definately go back to punta cana just not this hotel the waiters and bartenders and housekeeping really tried hard to make you happy the front desk should try a little harder people come from all over the world and many languages are spoken by the vacationers but the front desk speaks spanish only and very limited english i speak a little spanish but not enough to resolve a problem 
beautiful property but huge disappointment  my family  i just returned from a 7 day stay on the tropical side of the resort we 'll never go back we have stayed @ other all - incl resorts before so what we found came as quite a shock i have never seen a resort where money truely did talk after reading one of the other reviews i find myself wondering if we may have gotten better rooms if we had offer a bribe to the receptionist as well we paid a significant cost for our room ( which we did not end up with )  were unaware that flashing cash would get us anything we wanted  get it 1st this sickens me beyond belief i feel bad they probably do not earn much for the work they do but perhaps they should make it a little less apparent tipping is everything we arrived @ the hotel to be greeted by a 2hr check - in all we got told want a problem with our res existed but not what the problem was we had been given adjoining rooms in the 04 villa but ended up as an afterthought in the 19 villa the rooms were in rough shape  need some updates/repairs there was constnt smell of feces in the bathrooms  beds like a stone we decided to listen to the vaca pkg presentation knowing it was designed to try to sell us something what we got was told how we were considered 2nd class  got only 2nd class because we did not choose their royal service option man is this a way to sell something point out what is wrong with the level they could afford for the sake a sale remember we already felt like an afterthought because of check - in the food was satisfactory in quality the restaurant selections were pretty good over all but far more of a headache than necessary to get a table ( perhaps money would have helped here too the place we enjoyed the most for quality of food  service it would be the capri restaurant however , the buffets lacked greatly in variety if you had the vip level your buffets were laid out in a a/c 'd  closed in room v the open plan of our side i 'm sure this would have prevented the sharing ( without knowing ) of bagels , breads ,  rolls service was a disappointment ( with the excpetion of the waitor @ the capri ) they were friendly but slow my children would order a drink and it would more than likely be almost the end of the meal before it arrived if you have a life threatening food allergy not commonly seen ( tomato ) expect trouble the language barrier was most difficult during these times god help you if you ask what is in something  not all the ingredients are listed our youngest child loved her camp activities but our 2 older ones had a terrible time to find out the activities either day or night too massive amounts of work if you are the type who was there to party then you had no problems the pools  beaches were beautiful but not enough covered seating ( needed to be there by 5-6am ) not good for those far away from either as we ended up the spa was okay but again language problems it 's not the most comfortable to sit there knowing you are being discussed but not fully understanding hey , could be helpful to have your manicurist understand the word ouch they hacked up my daughter 's cuticals  she is now waiting for them to heal what she got was oops , do not tell boss in closing , this was our last visit to this resort  pening tell others to avoid it if you have already booked your stay  cannot get out of it i suggest upgrading to vip if you can afford it or expect things to go bad avoid the presentation unless you want to feel stupid for wanting to research things before ou hand over a huge amount of your hard earned cash  have the 2nd class status reinforced if the review i read if correct then bring lots of small bills to buy your way to anything you want ( better room , better service ,  better experience ) 
if you do not have kids search for another option i 've just returned from the melia caribe tropical yesterday overall it was fun but the hotel it 's too big so be careful and bring flat shoes no high heels you will regret it we stayed at the caribe side very close to the beach , the room was nice but nothing fancy the beach is beautiful so i recommend you ( if you do not have kids ) to stay away from the pool , it 's too crowded and full of children running around the food is good but the best thing of all it 's the people that work there , everyone is happy and helpful avoid the sales people from the vacation club they are a pain the best thing to do after dinner is to go to the tropical side have some drinks and dance there 's a guy name cafe that sings every night it 's fun the bartenders at the lobby bar are really nice especially felix and you can also dance with the guys that work there for the dinner reservations call in advance and do not miss capri it 's the best of all the restaurants main facts : if you have children and are looking for a nice place to go this is the right choice if you are a young couple looking for relaxation and no kids try something else ( secrets , etc ) if you are a group of young people looking to party go to cancun 
good trip in the end i just returned from a six day stay at the melia caribe tropical in punta cana i cannot say i was disappointed , but at the same time , i definitely would not return basically , i 'd say you get what you paid for food : so - so breakfast was delicious i definitely recommend los atables ' omelet bar lunch was fine , not delicious , but tolerable for dinner we tried : american grill , hokkaido , and la pagoda the american grill was absolutely excellent do not go expecting truly amercican food though , keep an open mind hokkaido was fun , and the food was good la pagoda was not very good in my opinion , but other people did enjoy it try and make reservations as early as possible (9-11 the day before ) or else there 's a good chance you will not get a spot - they fill up extremely quickly rooms : i was disappointed in the rooms they smelled terrible the entire stay , and were dirty , with dirt and sand all over there was also lots of mold and mildew in the bathroom , and the water pressure made it impossible to take showers some days service/ check in - out : the people here were very , very nice the language barrior was confusing , but as long as you know a few spanish words , it 's fine check in/ out was very slow , but the computers were down when we arrived , so it was not completely their fault i 'd say check - in was the worst part of the trip i was tempted to book a flight home right then we had no room for three hours , then we had a regular room with no electricity , when we had asked for rs however , i 'm glad we stayed , because the trip turned out great beach/ pool : the beach was beautiful , but the seaweed was a problem you had to walk very far to get away from it all the water was warm , and a gorgeous turquoise color - it made all the stress we 'd gone through worth it the main pool is absolutely huge , and the swim - up bar was great finding a chair was difficult , so go early in the morning and make sure to get one the spa was also great - i had an anti - stress / relaxtion massage , and it was exactly as the name implies - very , very relaxing well worth the money also , the resort is huge while this is nice , it was difficult to get around there was a train , but i found it easier to walk than to wait for it all the time be sure to bring sneakers or comfy shoes because honestly , it takes at least 15 mins to get anywhere in this resort finally , be sure to pack everything you need i had my sunscreen confiscated at the airport security so i needed to buy more at the hotel gift shop it cost $20 for a tiny tube of sunblock here the gift shop is ridiculously overpriced for everything ( $10 for magazines , $50 for t - shirts ) so do not plan on getting much shopping done all in all , the hotel is very pleasant , and the trip is worth the money but if you 've got a larger time frame / budget , i recommend doing some reserarch and finding another option 
i read the reviews on this resort after booking our trip we had concerns about the negative reviews , but realize you ca not please all of the people all of the time , and so we decided to go open minded considering what this trip cost i suppose it is good value for money , however , we understand there is a price for good service and are willing to pay for it , and therefore , would not return here there are 7 al - a - carte restaurants at this resort - wonderful we will be able to eat at a different one every night , uh uh , we were only able to eat at 3, which were the least popular ones at the least popular time of day (6:00 p and they were only 1/4 full as mentioned by other reviewers one must make a reservation , either that day beginning at 8 a or the previous evening beginning at 9:00 p i thought these complainers were probably just too disorganized to call at the appropriate times if we called first thing in the morning everything was booked but they suggested calling back @ 4:00 p - maybe something would be available then ( ) that is how we obtained the reservations we got , but there was never any choice o , i thought , ok , we have to be quicker on the draw and thus tried calling @ 9:00 p the phone rang busy , busy , busy until i got through @ 9:30 p everything is booked the next night we tried again on automatic redial , hooray i got through 10 minutes earlier @ 9:20 p only to hear everything is booked what does it take to get a reservation lady , there are a lot of people at this resort , we have been answering the phones for 20 minutes solid my husband spoke to someone at guest services about this problem , to no avail we found this was causing us stress as this was supposed to be a vacation to unwind we gave up and resorted to eating at the buffets beware , there is a pecking order at this resort we found out talking to various guests that they block off seats in the restaurants for first of all the royal service guests , secondly , the condo owners , thirdly the potential condo buyers , and lastly if there are any seats left , they are up for grabs by the poor plebs like us i have addressed some of the other concerns mentioned by previous reviewers : check in : at the best it is slooow it was disastrous there were only 2 other groups of people in front of us checking in but it took almost an hour for the procedure the employees behind the desk stare at a computer screen without any communication with the patrons and click : stare and click , stare and click you get the picture finally we secure a key to our room we relinquished our bags to the bellboy and carry our carry on bags , as they hold our valuables , computer etc they are heavy it is dark it is late we are tired did i mention how big the resort is finally we find our room we walk in , houskeeping has not been in this room since the last guests left bed unmade , dirty towels strewn about and something sticky spilled on the floor after a few superlatives were exchanged we shlepped back to the front desk the young lady who listened to our problem did not say a word to us but started the stare and click procedure all over again ( we found out a few days later she did not speak any english ) a more senior person came along - did appologize , and said he upgraded us to a better vip room ( it was exactly the same as the first room except housekeeping had visited it and that we should look him up to obtain a really nice dinner reservation why would we need his help with that 'grounds : the grounds are beautiful , lush and tropical the resort is huge for the most part we enjoyed walking around , but it is definately not the place to go for the elderly or the immobile yes , there is a train to get you around if you so choose , but , the walk from your room to the closest train station could be quite a trek walkways : the cobblestone walkways look lovely the first day i wore fairly flat sandles , after turning over on my ankle 3 times the first day i threw glamor to the wind and resorted to wearing running shoes everwhere ladies , leave your strappy high heals at home i brought a pair , but would not wear them the walkways are very slippery when wet they have signs stating this every 10 feet bugs and pests : as there had been some malaria outbreaks in this region it was a concern i think you have more chance of getting west nile virus in your own backyard at home than malaria here there is an obvious lack of insects they are kept in check the real pests are the ones selling timeshares they are unavoidable as they are set up at the entrances to the buffets and the main buildings at first we were pleasantly responding with no gracious that did not deter them enough and so we escalated to ignoring them once when we used this method we were met with a raised voice and : hey i 'm talking to you i asked you a question language : this is a spanish speaking country people complaining about the lack of english should stay home - or so i thought i would expect the maids , waiters , bus boys , most staff not to speak english however , when the majority of their guests are english speaking , you would expect a requirement for certain positions ( such as the front desk ) would be to speak english this is the hospitality industry pools : they were beautiful lots of cabanas , but people try to reserve them with towels , although there are signs everywhere asking you not to do this the tropical pool is less crowded , although this is where the kid 's centre is , so - lots of kids i happen to like kids , and so do not see this as negative great for families there seemed to be quite a discrepancy with other reviewers regarding this point i undertstand why 
do not come here for the food i 'll jiust make bullets for quick reading : *check in was horrible took 20 min , and they do not speak english until they try and sell you the $2 per day cost for use of the in room safe that requires a code to be programmed on your room key *room was not available until after 3p the place is so big , we had no idea where we were and after we got a bite , we decided to go to the room they were just finishing up and we got in the room but , we did not have our bags , so , we had to wait 45 min for them then , we did not have our keys , but , two towel cards after an hour , it got straightened out*the food and drink first of all , you cannot drink water from the tap here at all not even to use to brush your teeth bottled water was available everywhere my wife and i and many of the others in our extremely large group thought the food was really really bad not sure what it was , it was just bad you had buffets for breakfast and lunch who would have thought that you can actually make bad eggs for dinner , you had to make reservations the night before or go to one of the buffets unless you were upgraded , you usually got the undesirable times there were many restaurants of the two we ate at , le gourmet and ma maison , it seemed as though the food was taken from the buffets and put on fancy plates and deliverd by waiters we had good service at le gourmet , but ma - maison blew after rushing us in , they got our order right away , got our apps and took over a half an hour for our mains we then waited another 15 min before they got our dirty plates we then waited another 10 for dessert this was the first vacation ever that we never looked forward to a meal *expect to walk mucho not really such a bad thing , but , can be of an inconvenience *ok , on the positive side , the place is gorgeous and the beach kicks butt large , soft white sand , beautiful water , lots of available chairs even at peak time do your homework there are better hotels probably with better food and just as good of a beach 
disappointed - - way too large - bad food - too much planning for an r pros quick flight from new york - hotel is only 20 minutes away royal service is the only way to survive at this resort/compound the private pool is breath taking sand at the beach is like powder and the water is a beautiful blue color grounds are immaculate unfortunately the nightmare began sooner than later royal service claims to provide butlers we met fransisco the first day and never saw him again all other guests had the same situation rooms have mildewy smell gym is terrible equiptment is so unsafe the cardio equiptment does not reset unless you unplug it the controls are all rotted the 2 universal weight stations dont even have pins they use old rusted screws so the weights fall stay away the spa - - absolutely disappointing cancelled rest of treatments after received first massage and saw less the adequate/unclean locker rooms wouldnt take my shoes off dinner reservations are a nightmare restaurants are literally empty if you walk in , but they wont seat you  you cant get a res 17 tables empty at a time once you get in food is below average take immodium and pepto very unaccomodating staff felt held hostage - no town no outside restaurants or safe place to walk around outside resort very confined would not reccomend for more than 4 days need to take trains to get anywhere in the resort - way too big 
nice hotel with bad service the hotel facilities are very nice , even though , lacking maintenance the hotel main building has fountains all over the place , however , none is working i guess that when the hotel was designed , the fountains were included to give a sense of freshness , since there is no ac at the lobby , bar and most of the spaces of this property , were the hot , hot , hot weather and high humidity are really annoying the people that work here seem to be doing it mostly for survival , not because they like their jobs most of them are very unfriendly and mean , as if they are providing a favor to the customer it is very interesting to see how all high executives are foreigners and dominicans are the ones in the lower ranks the meanest of them all were the reservations manager at this hotel and marilyn , the lady at the entrance of the japanese restaurant by the way , food is not so nice at any of the understtaffed restaurants the servicio real ( royal service ) restaurant , by the pool is filled with flies and nobody does anything to have them fly away the servicio real at the beach its not worth the name the gardens of the hotel are perfectly maintained , but again , the fountains in the gardens are not running , turning the nice ponds into mosquito reservoirs the only person that made our stay gratifyng was the lady that cleaned our room , veronica , who was always trying its best to provide an excellent service the hotel is really beautiful , but service and maintenance are not their qualities 
a terrible experience the worst nightmare i 've ever lived my wife got a severe food poison for which we 've spent 3 nights in a hospital in punta cana you 'll probably say was just our bad luck but then why the hospital was full with ppl with the same problem and most of them from the same resort ( melia caribe tropical ) service is bad too and very few exceptions did not change the overall impression at the end a group of ppl from th hospital we 've decided to send a formal letter through a lawyer to general manager of the melia caribe /tropical 
great vacation we stayed at the melia caribe july 9-16 we had a great time the grounds are beautiful and the rooms were very clean the staff was more than accomodating the food was not great but , we managed we came to relax and did just that ca not wait to go back 
great hotel , stolen camera this is a bitter sweet review my husband and i visited melia caribe 3 weeks ago for our honeymoon we were told that check in was at 3pm we arrived at the beautiful hotel around 12:30ish and were let into our room we purchased a safe upon check in when we arrived in our room our safe was not opened for us to use and thus , set the 4 digit combination we immediately called for help to open our safe we planned on attending the apple vacations briefing at 5pm about 3ish , after waiting over an hour for service for our safe , we left the hotel room to see the beach on our way to the briefing because our safe was not open we planned to take everything of value i took my $750 nikon coolpix camera ( with wedding photos on ) out of the bag and got it ready to take we ended up getting about 50 ft outside our room when i realized i forgot it and left it sitting on the couch in the room my husband said we would just grab it later as we were not planning on being gone long we came back to the room later that night and went to bed the next morning we went to get the camera and it was gone we went to the front desk and security came to our room we explained what happend and they told us they would take a security reading from the lock on the room door to see who went in and out of the room in the last 24 hours later that night after some investigation took place we met back up with the security man he showed us the data from the door on who came and went and it showed that two people came and left that room while we were gone they told us the asked them about the camera and they said no i was thinking well no **** of course they are not gonig to admit it the security man kept trying to tell us that it never happens and sometimes when people are on vacation they lose stuff well we had been on the island less than 4 hours - we did not go anywhere where would we have lost it i know it was on that couch and for him to try and persuade me different they took our statement and nothing happend we have heard nothing our camera was stolen - on the first day of our honeymoon they are so poor in this country that they probably steal like on the 3rd day of your trip when you have been places and think you just lost the missing item when you went some place regardless , the hotel is amazing the best on the island we would stay there again we would just stay as long as it takes for them to come open our darn safe words of advice take one - time - use cameras 
do not reserve unless you get the vip service upgrade this is my third time at punta cana first time at a three star all inclusive followed by a four star all inclusive and now this five star i think the hotel must have made up its own rating system because this certainly was not as nice as a motel 8 first of all , it took us literally one and a half hours to check in i am seriously not exaggerating we were staying with a group and two of the three rooms were not ready until 5pm we had to hunt down cleaning staff to clean those rooms we have a seven month old and had to pull in a crib from outside ( yes outside ) ourselves despite the fact that we had ordered the crib well in advance and had confirmed it twice at check in i cleaned it myself and luckily brought my own crib sheet do not exect to have clean towels until night time and a few nights we did not have pillow covers ( they forgot to put them on yes , we tipped every day - - and it apparently did not matter we would have to hunt down the maid to get bottled water and felt like we had to bribe him with a $5 tip to get more since we were washing baby bottles with the water as well well , you get the idea ants , cockroaches , bedbugs , mosquitoes in the room , etc by the way , this is the first time i have written a review on trip advisor and never complain about hotels - - - moving on to the pools and the beaches are very nice however , the pool was very slippery they have outdoor shaded matresses at the pool which are nice but watch out because there was a rat in between the mattress where my infant daughter was sleeping by the way , watched the mixed drinks , they wash the blender out with regular tap water we all had stomach problems and still do ( got home yesterday ) all in all , place is beautiful but service is terrible ( you cannot get a hold of the front desk - - they put you on hold for hours or hang up on you a couple we spoke with said for $100 more you can upgrade to the vip service which has its own transportation , restaurants and room service we were all annoyed that aaa did not tell us about this i have stayed at the royal service which i hear is similar in the flamenco and was well worth it it literally is $100 more for the entire trip and makes all the difference in the world this resort is not recommended for senior citizens due to the walking nor for families with infants bring bug spray 
not a 5 star we were a group of 15, stayed at the melia caribe from july 11th returned on the 18th check in was fine , luggage was brought to our room quick i just read a review about the woman at the front desk who took that persons credit card to the back room and now she has charges on that card from several gas stations in dr i am very concerned about that the woman at the front desk took quite sometime with my credit card in that back room also i am calling my credit card company today anyway , this has been our 6th time to punta cana and always had great service and the staff was always friendly but sorry to say not at this resort , and we were dissappointed the service at all the bars including the lobby bars were terrible , i can see if they were busy but sorry they were not we all did notice the staff would always look at your hand to see if you are giving them a tip of course we always tip but it was quite noticeable that they were looking for one rooms were ok , we were on the caribe side , close to the beach and main pool which was nice this was the first time we stayed at an all inclusive resort that did not have the mini fridge stocked with beer only soft drinks and water , so if you like to have a couple of beers before you go out do not expect it to be in the fridge the beach is beautiful , water was clean plenty of lounge chairs and huts , but again dissappointed cause there was no beach bar the only bar on the beach was a little hut that just served beer and soft drinks and the guy that served you was so rude to get any mixed drinks you would have to walk through the beach restaurant passed the buffet and that was the bar oh yea , and no music on the beach pool : needs to be maintained , paint is chipping and looks very tacky swim up bar - again service was not good at all grounds are very nice , kept clean this resort is huge so remember to wear comfortable shoes restaurants : you have to call at 7:00 am to get reservations at any of the ala carte restaurants we did hear alot of people complaining about this , you are on vacation who wants to get up at 7am to call for reservations we tried all but the chinese , italian and dominican japanesse , capri ( seafood ) gourmet , mexican , french and american grill were all great we did hear that the chinese and italian were not that good the breakfast and lunch buffet was ok our group did have a nice time but would not recommend the melia caribe tropical 
very disappointed with the standard of cleanliness in room and housekeeping in g spent one week at this hotel and would not go back it was a long way to travel , especially for one week i took my daughter and two grandchildren and having checked reviews etc plumped for this hotel on a positive note i have to say that the staff were very pleasant and the childrens club when it was eventually finished midway through the holiday provided a worthwhile experience for the grandchildren the staff at the childrens club were exceptional considering the conditions that they were having to work in - building work being completed , painting of the outer building etc the bedroom smelt of mould and a mustiness that was disgusting it was possible that this was as a result of the jacussi/bath being placed openly within the bedroom and not as a separate attached room the bedding was of a poor standard and i am quite certain that the bedroom floor was not washed during the whole of our stay - the childrens feet were black and that was after they had just showered the towels were of a poor quality - when we actually were given them and despite reporting the lack of towels to guest relations we are still waiting for the housekeeping supervisor to bring them housekeeping may seem a trivial point of discussion but in actual fact a number of assumptions are made based on your immediate opinion of the room that has been allocated to you - if it 's not what you expect , and of a poor standard then you begin to wonder what you have actally paid for i certainly did not anticipate it being so poor especially as the hotel boasts a five star rating i note that most of the rave reviews are from visitors from canada and the usa and i found that extremely surprising knowing the high standards that they offer in their own country although i 've had the opportunity to voice my opinion of the room we were allocated and the general poor standard of the housekeeping - sack the supervisor i say i must say that the food was plentiful and of a good standard the choice of cuisine was varied and the weather - even though it rained everyday , was superb staff at the bars , restaurants and kiddies club exceptional 
majestic hotel - a breif visit and review i was a member of a group of 19 attending a wedding overall the week was ok rooms were well kept the food was often cold the staff generally were terrific and responsive , the evening entertainment usually was good and diosplayed many local talented people the hotel was too isolated i am not a beach and bake person the diversity of people we met was terrific we found that going to the same eating place usually resulted in being served by the same people in our case , maurinto , sucre , salavdor , clara , and felix they did quickly come to know us , learned our preferences regaredless of which meal ( not all were at their buffet place ) usually breakfast and several lunches and dinners since i had to do some work , i found the reception staff very helpful and cooperative , such as janet vega i mention the staff and the people who looked after us primarily because they worked so hard to help out and within their domain helped for a pleasant stay 
good and bad this is a very long review i have included the good and bad , but what was bad for us others may not mind i have included some tips of the things you can do to enjoy your stay more , and avoid the problems we encountered we stayed at this resort for only a week in december , and originally i was sad to be only going away for one week however by the end of the week we were glad to be going home it is a beautiful hotel with a lot of amazing staff some staff such as housekeeping as has been said in other reviews iffy we tipped $5 a day , i do not know if this is reasonable or not , but sometimes as in other reviews they would not show up , not that we cared it made no difference to us we read in the booklet from our room as well as on trip advisor to tip right away and this will ensure good service we learnt quickly this is not acurate , at least not for us after having to get denny on the beach 's attention for drinks we tipped him ( around $4 or $5 for 2 drinks ) thinking we would not have to find him and he would come to us in the same spot right in the area he was working , however he never bothered to check with us again so we learned the obvious , tip after good service not to get it but as i mentioned before perhaps we do not tip enough which is sort of weird because apparently tips are included in the all inclusive price we booked an ocean front colonial juinor suite ( with the jaccuzzi both in the room and on the deck , more about the jaccuzzi 's later ) the deck and view were spectacular and we requested the most private balcony when we booked through west jet not really expecting to get it , but we did and loved it there was supposed to be a bottle of both rum and whiskey upon arrival in the room also with a fruit basket the fruit basket was there and so were the glasses but the bottles of rum and whiskey were never seen for us this was not a huge deal as it is all inclusive and you could not go more then 300 feet without finding a bar , but it is nice to get what you are supposed to without having to fight for it or consently remind and ask for things we mentioned this to our hola trip representative and she said she would mention it to the hotel , weither she did or not either way we never heard about it again we also noticed and mentioned to her that our room service privacy door lock was broken , basically meaning anyone could get into our room threw it from the outside , this also was never addressed/fixed my husband ended up jamming it from the inside with a spoon however much that really would have stopped someone i do not really know again possibly not the hotels fault if the rep never did mention it to them we did not feel like fighting with people our whole week there , and i think we are fairly easy going , so just let everything slide as for the privacy room service door , i am not sure why they have it as the one day that we got room service for breakfast ( which also comes with the room category and which we did not have to remind them ) they never used it anyways they woke us up and came into the room again not a big deal unless you are expecting them to use the privacy door and you are not ready for someone to come into the room , which we would have been if not for the door anyways , so well just do not expect it maybe , and take pj 's apparently there is also a sensor in the room that tells staff when you are in the room automatically and they will never disturb you , this did not work for us they constantly knocked when we were in our room and we did not have the old fashioned yet highly effective do not disturb sign however we did see these signs elsewhere through out the hotel so if this is something important to you , you may want to ask for one on checkin you are also supposed to get slippers and house coats for use during your stay the house coats were there however they were very small , and there were not slippers so if these things are important to you and you are not a size 0-4 you may want to bring your own this would not have mattered to us other then the staff knocking and we were scrambling for clothes , oh yes and they only knock twice and come in so do not just grab a robe and head for the door , yell 'just a minute ' or something like that as for the jaccuzzi 's we never used the one on the deck as it took to long to fill and the smaller one in the room took a long time as well and the water dissappeared quickly once it was full , so we only used it once in this category of room there is supposed to be beach towels in the room , ours also were missing , no big deal we walked down to the towel hut and tried to get towels and they would not give them to us without a card not a problem and understandable , we went to the front desk and after explaining that the towels were never in our room did manage to get the cards and then return to the towel hut and trade the card for towels , so if you are in this category of room might be useful to make sure either the yellow beach towels ( room towels are white ) are in your room before the bellman leaves or that you have towel cards not sure if we just have bad luck or what the food , well my husband was sick from the day after we arrived until days after arriving home and i was lucky enough to not get sick until about our third day but was also still sick for sometime after returning home we did not drink any of the water as reccommended and we used bottled water for brushing our teeth , so not sure what that was about the food is not horrible but it is not great either definetly take some immodium if you do not need it great , but if you do at least you have it we were glad we did we also were pretty glad we took a roll of toilet paper from home to the paper there is not bad or anything but it is nice to have some really good stuff if you end up having to frequent the bathroom at least we did not gain weight this year , unlike previous trips elsewhere , which is good the beach was outstanding , the water is rough but it was windy the whole time we were there but we did not mind we kind of enjoyed the waves and spent pretty much all day every day on the beach and the water was not so rough , that the childern playing in it had any problems there is fish you can feed right off the beach in not more then thigh high deep water and we never wore shoes in the water , there are some rocks to look out for but we did not have a problem the sand was amazing and we walked for miles barefoot another great point about the beach you could walk and walk along the ocean there are a lot of photographers along the beach that will take pictures for you and they do an absoultely amazing job take advantage of it , the prices are not horrible , and you do not have to buy if you do not want to or end up not liking them i would recommend taking some kind of inflatable lounger if you like to float in the pool and the beach chairs are not super comfortable i did get maybe six mosquito bites but my husband did not even get one and we did not use any repalinat , so i do not think they are that bad of course we are from saskatchewan as for the children , we were aware that this is a family resort when we went , and we do not particularly like kids , at all however i thought the resort was large enough we would easily be able to avoid them especailly since there are childern areas not so , if you really are looking to get away from kids , or are like us and just are not really kid people , i would highly recommend thinking about adults only resorts , and not this resort there were crying screaming kids everywhere or we have some really bad luck , and apparently the parents are oblivious to this screaming and acting out i do not know we went during the school season so this made no difference either like i said it is a family resort and we were aware of this so our bad , but important lesson learned spa ~ we each had half hour massages on the beach and really enjoyed them , so next day we went to book hour long massages at the spa my husband was in a lot of pain from the beds or pillows so he wanted to try the deep tissue massage i not being that brave and just wanting an enjoyable experience wanted the relaxation massage they seemed to understand when we booked , but well somehow we both ended up getting the deep tissue and i was left bruised and in pain however i should have probably attempted to stop her and sort out the problem right away rather then suffer the hour long torture but was not sure with the language barrier if it would work anyway so just endured nothing against the spa as far as the bruises and pain go as i am told this is typical with a deep tissue , and i take medication to thin my blood so am more prone to bruising so you may just want to confirm with your therapist that you are getting what you really want before they begin , to avoid the same mistake i made , and obviously i do not recommend the deep tissue to anyone on anticoagulation therapy we really liked the waiters and waitresses at all of the resturants and most of the bartenders they were friendly and always happy if you know spanish you will have an easier time at this resort , however it is not a big deal if you do not , they are pretty good with english some good drinks to try are the miami vice and of course the majestic you have to ask to have alcohol in your drink which i thought was a good thing , since it is a family resort with all the kids and preggo 's the resort is about 1/4 mile long so there is a lot of walking but we enjoy this we noted a few people in medichairs so it is a very accessible resort if you have a disability there are elevators at the stairways everywhere we noticed and there were ramps into the lobby to the resturants and on the beach bar area the trip all in all was not our best , and i am not really sure we would return to this hotel , mostly for the fact of the kids it was clean and friendly with a beautiful pool and beach and nice rooms 
just ok my fiance and i stayed the week of dec 8th at majestic colonial , the water and beach were tremendous , the pool was clean and clear , the rooms were cleaned at 5pm which was upsetting , but the room was just fine absolute and premium liquers were controlled and readily available problem was the food , which just doesnt cut it breakfast was the best but alot of things were cold french toast and pancakes mexican was awful , the buffet just about average , the steak house and seafood was ok and the french was pretty good , just the dominican food in general was not good as all , we didnt get sick but were bloated all the time andnot from eating too much wasour third trip to punta cana and third hotel , it was supposed to be rated number 1 in jpunta cana but far from that maybe number 5 we will stick to jamaica and couples swept away which is a bit more but 5 star 
" interesting " my wife and i have traveled for many years and this hotel had its ups and downs but certain qualities bugged us the most the hotel staff could not have been nicer from the bar folks to the waiters to the front desk we were very pleased with the attitude and service all around mainly ate at the buffets even though i really do not like eating that way because cold food is real cold and hot food is very cold the selection of foods at the beach buffet was very limited the other buffet near the front lobby was larger and better selections by far the service at the buffets were amazing the drinks kept coming until you told them to stop and the minute you were done with your plate , they came to remove it very fast service by the third or fourth day the drink waiters knew what you were drinking at each meal our room was fine it was clean and everyday the minibar was stocked with soda and water now the down part - - when you check in they give you two towel cards and that is all you are allowed to get one towel per person this is insane we ended up taking our towels from our room and using them and asking for more from our room attendant the food at the buffet was cold for the most part no matter where you went the fries were soggy most of the time nobody really understands much english so dont try to ask for any food done differently , , , they won they turn off all the ice machines around 10:30 at night let me repeat that they turn off all the ice machines around 10:30 at night that is also nuts especially in weather like this if you want ice then you must walk to the main bars and fill your ice bucket that way room service also stops at around 11:00pm i recommend you bring a large cup for your drinks and keep it for the duration of your trip although you can get as many drinks as you like , you will be served in small plastic cups and you will be glad you brought your big mug from home they gladly fill them up no matter what size they are so bring the big insulated one and finally let me say that the staff here are happy and pleasant and never say no except for the casino workers , everyone here is great the casino people speak no english and are rude and not nice at all it also smells for some reason we will come back here and recommend this hotel to anyone who likes to eat and drink , the food quality is not first class but by no means is it bad if you can deal with buffets then you will be fine and happy with the selections hope this helps happy and safe travels 
sub -4 star we stayed at the majestic colonial for 3 nights/4 days with a large group the trip was fabulous but i attribute most of the positives to the group that i was with and to the staff of the resort below is my attempt to write a neutral and comprehensive review of majestic colonial because i rely heavily on these reviews when i travel staff* the team in place throughout this resort is very professional* english is clearly not their first language , but each of the servers and staff was able to successfully and positively communicate despite the potential language barriers* check out victor by the pool bar - - - the other reviews are spot on when they praise him* it helps to tip ( the drive from the airport to the resort shows how poor it is in the immediate area ) facilities* in general , the facilities throughout the resort are clean and nice* the beach is absolutely gorgeous and i 'd return to punta cana anytime for the lovely beaches* we were surprised that this resort is only several years old because the building structures , outdoor furniture , and pool area seem older and dated* the large pool is great , especially if the resort is ever at full capacity* the situation with the towels annoyed me after a while ( even though you had a bracelet and key , you still have to show the towel card ) * the disco was entertaining , but the casino is pretty pathetic ( and very smoky ) * the walkways were always cleanfood* the food was horrible ( there 's just no other way to describe it ) * typically , the breakfast options at these all - inclusives are good and , in general , fulfill the purpose - - - not here the breakfast/brunch was not very impressive and i worried about the overall cleanliness at the buffet* still worse were the restaurant options it did not matter where you ate , everything had the same taste and no appeal* the only positive that i have relating to the food was our experience at the japanese restaurant ( we made reservations for the hibachi ) the food was okay here but it was the chefs that made this one of our favorite dinners - - - thank you , marcelino and davio i highly recommend you all make the reservations and eat here the room grew more dissatisfactory as the trip went on* our bed was not made when we first arrived , which was not a big deal because we wanted to head to the pool right away but , by nighttime , it still was not made and the comforter was stained ( gross the rooms never really felt really clean and again , you realized quickly where the resort skimped ( mold near the sinks , clogged sink , broken jacuzzi , etc ) overall resort* while we had a nice time on this trip , i cannot honestly say that i 'd return to the majestic colonial* when deciding to write a review , i hoped to project an accurate and thsu meaningful contribution in that regard , i would say that my experience is relative to other true 4-5 star all - inclusives that i 've visited ( riu palace and dreams resorts ) compared to these other franchises , majestic colonial disappoints and falls in the sub -4 star category 
our honey moon at the majestic colonial dear fellow travelers , just wanted to let you know how are vacation went at the majestic colonial in punta cana we had noted that it was our honeymoon right on the hotel voucher but you know what , nothing special or extra was done at all for us we had talked to 3 other honeymoon couples from ontario and they all told us that they had swans made out of towels , rose pedals in a hot bathtub and special romantic dinners we on the other hand got nothing , we were disappointed on that aspect of it being our special vacation/honeymoon it was mentioned right on the voucher as well but i guess that their staff did not notice that ahead of time i had left tips almost every day of $5 us a day , now down here that 's alot , our other honeymooner couple told us that they were leaving $1 us a day and they were the ones getting the swans and rose pedals i do not get it we were not impressed at all the place is very nice and pretty clean it is a lot different in person than in the pictures the room cleaning was bad they did not really clean but picked up the room i had to ask 4 times for basic items such as a bathmat and face clothes , i should not ever have to ask for these items in a so called 5 star hotel they gave us 1 coffee for the room and when it was finished they never replaced it , again we had to chase the maid down hall and get one from her very unprofessional and it seemed like the maid did not really care about her job and yet we were leaving $5 a day tips for her after days of service like this i stopped the tips pretty fast mosquito 's were another problem the first day or two i must have killed 60 of them in our room alone finally i went down to the lobby and asked if they could do something about it i was told that they could spray the room and it would help it did help somewhat and cut down on the mosquito 's considerably to come to a conclusion the small things were just not there at all , and that 's what counts for us they really need to have their employees learn some english as well , most of the employees we spoke to , spoke nothing but spanish and smiled the most beautiful part of our trip was the excursion to sanoma island it was breathtaking and fun so in the end we were not that impressed with their resort , and would never go back there , we had much better service and professionalism at the riu in playa del carmin , mexico in february thanks , gary and susan 
i just got back from my future sister in law 's 4 day bachelorette party at the majestic colonial while this hotel is very beautiful , we were not happy with the service there was no waitor service around the pool nor by the beach , so if you wanted a drink you would have to get up and go to the bar each time the male staff seemed to undress you with their eyes and really just had poor communication skills the food was terrible , my sister in law actually got sick one of the nights we were there our room had tiny little ants everywhere , we all left with a million bites around our feet and ankles they had a flea market set up on the property one of the nights and the staff that worked it were very pushy in trying to get you to buy things i just feel like if you are staying in a 4 or 5 star resort i should not have to feel like i was be harassed while trying to walk through the resort i must say though that the beach and ocean were amazing all in all we had a good time but only because of the company we were with i would definitely return to punta cana because the beach was so beautiful but i would never stay at this hotel again 
we had cock roaches in our room our room was infested with mosquitos and roaches and had an unpleasant odor management agreed to change our room , but we found even more roaches and mosquitos in the second room my husbnad and i found ourselves killing bugs during our whole stay mangement offered us room service and i got a free manicure , but we would have rather had a bug free room the resort only served one type of beer and the frozen mixed drinks were not good some of the staff were not friendly and very few spoke english the pool was the best part of the trip 
i was there from july 12- july 19 first , the hotel and beach are beautiful however , the hotel front desk managers are incompetent and have no idea of the meaning of good customer service i had booked the 1 bedroom majestic colonial suite and they did not have it when i arrived i was given a room that was 2 categories lower additionally , they never apologized for not having my room available when i arrived they acted like they were doing me a favor by helping me at all also , we were not taken to our room we were given verbal directions to the room and we were lost as the place is so big victor , the general manager would not come out of his office to talk with me on 3 separate occasions he sent different managers to talk with me i asked the mangers to tell victor to come out and talk with me but he never did they tried to compensate us with a massage for my girlfriend and myself but as we have back issues we told them that we needed a different form of compensation it took two days before they agreed to give us a romantic dinner on the beach when i asked them what the room difference was between the room i paid for and the room i was given , they would not tell me i asked them how i could determine if i was being fairly compensated if i did not know how much the lower cost room was after further questioning they told me the price was $30 for the two of us however , the price of the room on their own web - site showed over a $150 differenceas for the dinner , i do not eat seaford so i was supposed to get a non - seafood substitute dinner when dinner arrived i was given a cesar salad with lobster , this had to be taken back and my girlfriend had to eat alone as the waiter on the beach had to return to the restaurant to get the chicken cesar salad then the appetizer arrived , a fish dish again , i told them i can?? eat it and i was not given a substitute dish then for the entr?e which was surf and turf , they just gave me ? of the entr?e , the steak one day we went back to the room and the card key did not work we had to wait a while for them to bring us a key when we asked them what happened to the lock they kind of blamed us and said you can?? store your key near a camera or cell phone i told them that i did not have a camera or cell phone anywhere within 10 feet of my key and yet they never gave me an apology for the inconvenience mike - astoria ny 
big problems we were just there for the week starting july 6th the resort itself is beautiful , food is typical for the islands , however the staff do not get the meaning of customer service the language problem is huge unless of course you spoke spanish we had a phone charger stolen from our suitcase , this tells me the cleaners or whoever else had access to our room went into our bags to retrieve it yes i know it is only a charger however the point is they went looking for it they need to learn from the cubans on how to train their staff i will not go back to the dominican again , i paid lots of money for this trip and did not expect this kind of behavior from staff i always give tips to people but not when a tip makes for better service or attention 
so so i do not know if other review writers have been to other all inclusives , the hotel is lovely , the service is not that great , it seems as if they do not have enough staff atthe dif bars the dominican and the seafood restaurants were the good , the rest of the restaurants were ok the rooms were spacious , but the open room concept must go sections of the beach were rocky , we were misinformed that punta cana was on the carribean side it is not i rather go to puerta plata were there is a city to see my wife and i was the only couple that wanted a king bed our other friends were not accomadated with doubles we had a hard time changing them with the mgmt i would not reccomend this hotel to anyone 
so so resort my family and i travelled to majestic colonial in july 07 the resort is lovely , beautiful grounds , rooms and beaches very nice the problem lies with the food/restaurants food is not good choices are horrible breakfast buffet closes at 10am , if you arrive at 10:01am you are out of luck each of the speciality a la carte restaurants features a buffet where you go and get your salads , appetizers , and desserts the only item you are ordering is the main entree so forget a long , relaxing dinner while we arent picky eaters , when we vacation we like a nice dinner sitting around enjoying conversation , good food and drinks not in and out in an hour they also blast spanish disco music on the beach and by the pool all day not relaxing and if you dont care for this type of music it can be a drag to lye on the beach read a book and listen to the surf 
great resort , except for administration and front desk we were there for the last week of april 2008 for my daughter 's wedding the whole thing was booked well in advance in october 2007 and the wedding was arranged through their wedding coordinator rooms and wedding arrangements were confirmed by the resort in december on the first day while checking , the only people who got the room they requested and payed for was the bride and groom and their baby we were supposed to have the majestic colonial suite , got a junior suite with no explanation we had to argue , show all the documentations , and waisted 2 hrs to explaine the error and got our room the next afternoon everybody else were bump to an other resort it took hours of arguments , frustations , and pleading by my daugther and son inlaw to finally get everybody moved to the resort in time for the wedding not the best way to start a vacation / wedding it seems the resort was way overbooked that week my guess , it was caused by a very large wedding during the weekend ( i doubt this was booked early ) , which somehow bump out people who booked their trip earlier bottom line , very poor administration and front desk service at this resort top 5 for everything else ( food , service , drink , etc ) too bad for the rest of the resort staff who puts 100 % in their work have to suffer for it 
majestic not digestable hola we booked our trip through continental airlines we selected a colonial junior suite w/full ocean view and outdoor jacuzzi before , during , and after we booked with majestic , we read reviews almost everyday mostly favorable except about the food from the start , its a 30 minute ride from the airport check in was easy waiting for us was a cold towel and drink and the desk clerk was friendly i took other reviewers advice about tipping a buck here and there pay - off at times we got to the majestic early and to our surprise our room was ready before the check - in time the desk clerk said we had one of the best rooms he escorted us to the bellboy and i tipped the desk clerk a 20 the staff was mostly pleasant they love saying hola we had to get to our room by van even the bellhop was impressed by the room size we had a bottle of champagne greeting us later a plate of fruit arrived and then free majestic polo shirts and hats thats tip #1 the room was big on the ground floor we had a full view of the water sport activity house and part ocean a little disappointed but i was just glad to be at this end of the resort the room itself was clean but it was weird the toilet is not really private and its tiny the patio had the jacuzzi which looked scummy so we did not use it so do not pay extra for it the rooms tub is a jacuzzi tub anyway the room and other parts of the resort had the same musty oder to it the beach is gorgious powder white sand and clean great views of the sunrise/sunsets the pool on our first three days was dirty it was difficult to swim in it filled with dead flies dozens of 'em the rest of the week it was spotless plenty of beach chairs and pool chairs to go around buffet is average nothing special about it the mexican place was good the french place , blah steak house good japanese , did not try it the wife got terribly sick after the french food i got sick from the buffet we never have gotten sick before from our travels in the caribbean until now we 're not drinkers so it was not alcohol related the food is awful for what the resort claims its stardards are it lacked quaity hopefully you wo not encounter waterbugs at 2am when you gotta use the toilet like i did keep a towel on the floor of the room entry door other guests did the same casino is small if you play slots forget it the machines are few and lousey the gym is small and half the machines did not work including the tredmills ( both ) and three out of the seven weight machines were broke the spa was average for all that was bad about the majestic , you ca not beat the sun and sand checking out was as smooth as check in was the van picked us up on time like we requested and the transportation was on time as well to the airport good luck if you choose this resort but i 'd think twice before coming here again 
everything but majestic majestic colonial is the worst hotel i 've ever been in we were 7 couples and at least 7 of got sick from the food my sister was so bad we called the doctor on premisis and it took 3 hrs for the doctor to arrive , and this was only because she threatened to call national television and let them know about the situation she had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance and she was hospitalized for 4 days with a bacteria from mishandled food , which my brother in law also submited to be tested and resulted positive from the same bacteria there also was a rat in the pool and was taken out also when threatened they did not evacuate the pool they just got a plastic bag and threw it away it seems to be if you do not scream you do not get anyhwere with them noone wants to be accountable for anything i sent an email to my travel agent with all the details of this horrific stay and i also found out that another couple that were staying there as well got sick they also sent an email with the complaint i have yet to hear from the general manager of this property 
dont go , your not safe we went to punta cana becuase it was a great value and all the reviews we read on trip advisor were amazing the food was horrible , it was to the point of it not being ediable my mother chocked on a potato after a midnight snack in one of the cafe 's on site and no one helped her i stood there screaming for help and the serves just stood there as well thank god my husband was there b/c he did the himlic on her we went to the nurse on site and she was no help she actually told us that my mother needed surgery b/c she still had small amount of food lodged into her lungs they sent an ambulance and took her to the hospital once my mother calmed down the food dis - lodged itself but reguardless we still had to pay a $900 american hospital bill when my mother never even saw a doctor they had bed pans in the middle of the waiting room it was the worst day of my life and the stay never made up for it you can never leave the resort b/c your not safe nor do they recomend it the beach itself was beautiful but the staff service and facility were no where near par 
beautiful place - terrible food just got home yesterday ( sun 23rd ) after cancelling my prior reservations at colony bay we choose majestic arrival was without incident at 11:00 but rooms not available until 3:00 p finally checked into room 3247, it is in a wonderful location with pool and ocean views though you have a very long walk to the lobby and most restaurants which is where everything mostly is the beach and water are beautiful with many huts but most people still reserve it really [ - ] me off when people reserve a hut with towels and books and do not show up until 2-3 pm ignorant you know who you are the pool was fantastic but chilly there was a tropical storm in the ocean only the weather remained perfect ( very strange ) this started on wed and did not let up until fri they had to close the beach completely on thurs caution tape was tied from tree to tree not allowing any access unfortunately , this storm wiped out much of the beach closest to the water and many huts leaving about a 10'drop the upper part is still fine but now a little busier coast guard helicopter came by sun morning before you know about that big barge that sits on a sand bar well you could not see it from the massive waves pounding it i thought for sure it was going to become lose and smash into shore now the food issues , horrendous my daughter (13) is still in bed sick and it 's monday morning with massive cramping and constantly on the toliet this started about wed and continued off and on the rest of the week sometimes feeling ok other times running for the t she was never right the remainder of our holiday she is not a huge eater but loves her breakfasts and stuck to waffle 's/french toast mostly but this did not help if she ate everything under the sun then ok this might happen my husband 6'2 235 lbs also got sick about wed even though he is a big guy he sticks to the basics and does not try what we do not recognize i cannot pinpoint exactly what it was but i will tell you that every single meal we had was freezing cold from the buffets to ala 'cartes the best meal was japanese ( make your res as soon as you arrive or you wont get in they have 3 seatings the gourmet do not waste your time heart of tenderloin ( filet mignon ) is un edible , that could have been the culprit i hope when she wakes up she will be better they have been living on melba toast i on the otherhand am ok but i also have a stomach of steel i know from experience that these things can happen with all the drinking , eating and the sun , but almost every review mentions the food issues take a box of melba toast with you this was our medicine we are well travelled and have never had worse food this was our 5th visit to d 
other places to visit my husband and i stayed at the majestic in november the week after thanksgiving we were really looking forward to this vacation away after hearing so many good things about punta cana in general as far as the hotel is concerned , we had a nice room overlooking the pool area which was very convenient the room had a musty smell but we both got use to it after a few days the room was always clean and had no issues with bugs in our room the grounds were very nice we spent most of our days lounging at the pool which is one of the best pools at a hotel we have ever stayed at as far as the food goes , it needs improvement honestly , neither of us became ill but it became extremely unappetizing after 2-3 days the pizza was recycled left overs as well as many other dishes we felt very confined in the hotel also we travelled out for a cab ride to another resort and felt very unsafe they do not have guards at the hotel entrances for no reason all in all , it was a relaxing vacation , the pool was great , the grounds were nice , but the food was horrible , and stay in your resort there are many other beautiful places to visit so i do not believe we will be going back 
average at best my family and i vacationed at the majestic jan 23rd thru the 30th this was our 5 th all inclusive all of which have been throughout the caribbean and mexico i want to start off by saying that it has taken me a while to write this review mainly because i was trying to formulate a review that did not revolve around a completely negative mind set i ve read many bad reviews prior to the trip that concerned me and i need to say that not all of them were false many had much truth behind them this is a legit review i follow trip advisor very regular and believe in its importance to the worlds travelers and greatly appretiate all who take the time to write in we flew usa 3000 out of chicago and cannot say enough about our experience i am a native of the windy city and can never remember such ease of travel we arrived in punta cana just as all have said to the open air port do yourselves a favor and have $10 per person ready as well as your immigration card in hand when you hit the first counter ( ours was not provided by the airline - they ran out ) so we scambled to fill it out at the last minute we used the company prieto tours to provide our transportation to the hotel and it worked out very well there were about 8-10 guys waiting near baggage claim to assist you ( more like jump on you like vultures - but their just trying to make a buck ) to the company counter make sure their shirts read prieto tours once at the counter our names and reservations were verified and we were immed shown to the van van was not bad air conditioning worked and it did not break down so i felt we were starting out right after about a 30-40minute ride we arrived at the majestic we were greeted with cool , mint scented towels to wipe our faces and refreshing fuit drinks called the majestic check - in was not bad either one room was ready the other we had to wait 30-45 minutes for a clean and prep by the time we ate lunch and checked back in we were set bell staff did a nice job getting our bags to our room quick and without confusion just an fyi , if you are traveling with little ones they do provide cribs at request now some general info : we made the mandatory reservations for the 2 ala carte restaur at arrival to ensure they did not all book up all the other ala cartes were first come first serve i have to say that the japanese and the steak were the best all others just average ( in my opinion ) the buffet was the most disappointing of all that we have encountered in our travels little to no taste to foods with rarely any variety the temperature of the foods were usually cool to warm breakfast was best so do not miss it ( i assure you i 'm not a fussy eater - i 'm from wisconsin ) hotel grounds were beautiful staff always fixing and cleaning beach was nice - usually always picked up and neat never had much trouble getting a chair either on the beach or near the pool pool clean and refreshing did have many wonderful staff but on more than a couple occasions were supprised at the snobbish , arrogance of others did have long waits at the bars for drinks even at times when they were slower probably good we are not big drinkers shops were very expensive for common items - so do your shopping well before your trip the casino was small - but the slots as described by one family memeber were loose maybe just their dumb luck and of course the language barrier - but they guys - - - your in a spanish speaking country we actually enjoyed using the spanish that we knew just need a bit more practice we ended our trip much like we started , a nice trip back to the cold and snow of wisconsin many more places to visit hope this helped a little have a nice vacation 
do not go there just came back from punta cana ( yesterday ) after 2 weeks we were there previously ( last year ) so were excited to go we read mixed reviews on this resort but thought we 'd make up our own minds if you are thinking of going to punta cana and this is your first time there , do not stay at the majestic last year we stayed at the gran bahia principe and loved it the people were very friendly and helpful , the food was amazing and always changing - plus there was a lot to do the majestic staff are rude ( this includes upper management ) and not friendly or helpful for the first week we had to ask daily for towels as there was 3 of us in a room we even wrote a note , drew a picture and showed the maids how many people stayed in the room they said ya , ya but we never did get 3 towels the food was the same and never hot ( eggs were always cold unless you had an omelet made but you had to wait in a huge line - up to get one ) the buffet at the bahia changed every day , so for 7 days you ate a different meal each evening they also had a lot of dominican meals to choose from at the majestic it was the same fries , pizza and warm pasta ( plus other meat ) and in and day you the a la carts were a joke their italian restaurant was part of the main buffet , the chinese was part of the japanese restaurant , the mexican part of the dominican restaurant and seafood was part of the steakhouse everyone in our group - there were about 20 of us we drank the bottled water and brushed our teeth with bottled water but everyone was still sick it does not help that when people are walking around looking at what to eat , they start picking at the food with their hands instead of the tongs supplied manners still apply when on holidays people the beach is not that great and there is a lot of coral about 10 feet out do wear beach socks if you are going into the water we were snorkeling out there are where you walk there is a lot of sea urchins in the coral for a resort that is only about 3 years only it looks in horrible condition the area around the pool has broken down so much that you need to wear flip flops otherwise you 'll be stepping on little pieces of cement the open concept toilet , bath tub and shower are not very attractive and if you are a large person or very tall , you 'll have problems in the toilet area we had problems with the water draining away from the drain in the shower and had water all over the floor , the faucets were not put on so you had to be careful turning water on ( this goes for the public washrooms as well ) , there were cracks in the walls and we did have visitors at night even though we did not have food in our rooms - yes cockroaches the sliding doors never locked - even on the 1st floor the main room doors had holes in them so you could literally see through them i could go on and on , but if you are really interested in going here email me and i 'll answer any questions you have 
first the positive ( not much ) : - the beach area is very nice and so is the ocean - we had suite with living room and 2 terraces negative : - concept of customer service is not there on any level is not edible room is nice the bed is extremely uncomfortable we go to all - inclusive once a year and i know what to expect from these places so i was not expecting ritz but this was just ridicules this is probably the worst experience i had with the resort 
just ok we arrived at the resort around 4pm got the whole wet towel and drink treatment and checked in we get to the room we had been assigned and it took me 4 2 seconds to realize it wasnt the room category we booked my first clue was that the room was on the second floor and we had booked a first floor room by the pool with a jacuzzi on the patio so i called my travel agent who called the hotel and spoke with victor it seems that since our room category was overbooked they downgraded us we went back to the front desk and victor informed us that we would get a new room but that it wouldnt be ready until 7pm we were soooo hungry but the only place for food was near the beach they had what looked like hamburgers and hotdogs i went for the hotdog as it looked more edible around 7pm we went back to the desk and the room still wasnt ready however , victor said he would show us the room to see if it would be ok my hubby and i were driven around to our room which was #2351 *also had electrical panel hanging off the wall* it was on the third floor oceanfront with a huge patio complete with lawn chairs and jacuzzi it was a definite upgrade from the room we booked *if you are interested in this room category you cant see the ocean unless ur standing up on the patio the ocean is not visible from the room itself* victor was also helpful in arranging a surprise birthday celebration complete with cake for my hubby at the gourmet restaurant he also allowed us to check out 2hrs later at no cost although we did have to wait 4 hrs for our room to be ready the good : - friendly staff *victor was excellent* - plenty of beach/pool chairs umbrella 's susana was wonderful grounds - clean - *really trying to come up with others*the bad : - hard to make reservations at the gourmet and hibachi restaurants they wanted to make us a reservation at the hibachi for the night after we left we complained and got a reservation with no problem even the gourmet restaurant claimed to be booked but always had tables available while we were there - stingy with the beach towels 1 per person and only with a towel card which we were not given at check in only 1 location to obtain/drop off towels very spread out *although not a bad thing except when you are hungry : ) * - food wasnt great it didnt make me sick so that was a plus 
disappointing not as good as presented by trip advisor reviewers before every trip , i review the comments and ratings provided on this site for my desired destination the data compiled on this site has proven very accurate in the past sure you can get some overly positive or negative reviews but usually you can pick up trends to help you understand what the resort is really like for the first time , i have found that the information provided by the majority of the reviewers for the majestic resort does not match what i experienced first hand normally , i would not provide my own review because i would only be repeating what had been said by other reviewers but in this case , i felt it necessary to balance things out a little and perhaps save some other innocent travelers the great feelings of disappointment that my family and i felt during our trip to the majestic but then again , if mosquitos , musty smelling water damaged rooms , worn out recreational equipment , dirty fitness room , poorly constructed buildings , unhelpful front desk personnel , noisy outside closet doors , unprofessional night time entertainment , and last but not least food that will probably make you ill is your thing then this is the place to go if you are lucky , you might get one of the good rooms they must exist because reviewers have documented how if you complain loud and hard enough they will move you to another better room unfortunately , we did not have such luck basic information : duration of vacation was one week starting december 27, 2007 and ending january 3, 2008 the weather was pretty good plenty of hot temperatures for water activity and just a little rain on one day stayed in room 1337 so , that 's building number 1 on the third floor in room 37 it should be noted that there are 4 buildings and for the most part they are only 3 stories high but in spots there are 4 floors our room was in one of the locations were there was another floor above us first , i will start with positives that are not directly related to the resort the beach was and is amazing also the water is pretty rough i like that because i find it fun to frolic in the waves so did my son however , this can be viewed as negative for families with young children it can be very dangerous two adults drowned on december 28th so you have to be careful this occurred off the beach at the excellence for the record , the excellence is quite a distance north of the majestic the water was rough as far as i could walk in both north and south directions i enjoy walking the beach i walked both north for an hour on one day and south for an hour another day and in both cases never reached the end of the beach this leads to the next group of positives , items directly related to the resort i liked where the resort was located to the south there is resort after resort and to the north you can walk on the beach where they are a couple of resorts then new a giant resort that 's under construction and eventually parts where there are no resorts at all just wild beach with all sorts of garbage laying around i counted two refrigerators a basketball and hundreds of plastic bottles i liked the beach but not the garbage i ca not blame the majestic for that however lobby is very attractive the grounds at the majestic are very nicely landscaped the pool is large and it is worked into the grounds in a way that is very appealing generally , the grounds are kept pretty clean i was happy with the cleaning staff with regards to daily maid service we were there for new year 's and the fireworks display was good also , the new year 's buffet was well done i ca not speak about all the rooms but the variant that we had was very spacious and most everything worked as it should no blocked drains , broken toilets , leaky taps , etc as reported in other reviews oops , sorry there was a problem with the balcony door not always closing and locking properly note : air conditioner is designed to only operate when door is closed and locked our room had a partial ocean view and it was no where near the construction site now for the negatives the room was the biggest disappointment very musty smelling obvious water damage to ceiling and arch over the jacuzzi once upon a time , water from the 4th floor unit above must have leaked down and the resulting damage was never fixed another interesting initial observation upon entering the room was that there were many squashed mosquitos on the ceiling and various walls my wife had asked for a ( cot ) for our son , in the event we could not get 2 double beds as it turned out the room did have 2 double beds but the resort gave us the cot anyway we did not need nor use the cot the cot is actually a single mattress and box spring the set in our room was dirty and ragged considering it 's condition , i would have had a difficult time using it as stated in the positives , the room was big and had a desk and chair as well as a sofa the chair was was stained and dirty the sofa was blocked by the cot and we never used it for the record , it looked in need of replacing and i saw them bringing in new ones but we never got one at night , there was a constant banging noise i eventually tracked down the cause and fixed it there are utility closets in the hallway that the maids use and i guess some closets provide access to pipes and wires at night , it is very windy causing the closet doors to bang loudly i saw down the hall that someone else had stuck a folded up napkin into the space between the closet door and the frame i did the same for the closets near our room and this solved the problem until someone needed to open the closets i had to do it a couple of times throughout the week even though we arrived very late , after seeing and smelling the room , we asked to change rooms we were given the old line that it was impossible because the place was full the person at the front desk suggested that we try again in the morning 
rushed to hospital i 'm not going to bore you with the little issues we had in our trip and so i will get straight to the point we went down dec 29/08 for 7 days , if you look at the date of this review you can tell we only made it for four days and we are now back in canada this was our 3rd trip to dr this hotel is beautiful , the beaches are spectacular and the rooms not too bad everyone knows that at a resort in the dr the waitstaff can be trying and the language barrier issue pops up often , but it 's tolerated after all we 're on vacation warning - this same level of sub standard service continues into their hospitals after two days my wife became so violently ill from the food at this resort she was rushed to a local ( private ) hospital she ( and i ) spent two days in this hosptial after she was admitted i was told to go back to the resort and leave her ( no way ) i spent two days on a wooden chair in a hallway as i was not aloud into the room my wife was so de - hydrated from the illness that an i line was in her arm she took 4 litres in the end over the two days they tried to give her anti - biotic , but my wife is five months pregnant and studies over here have conclusive evidence that antibiotics should not be administered during as pregnancy this hospital tried to give her antibiotics and when my wife asked what it was they were trying to give her , the nurse did not know she told my wife to take the pills and a needle because the doctor says she had to and she must do what the doctor said my wife refused and the nurse threw the products against a wall and walked out after that we never saw a doctor again just a nurse who changed the saline i could go on and on about the no soap or no toilet seats and the ants running around in the washrooms , no pillows or blankets on the beds in the rooms etc etc , but i wo not horrify you all i am saying is that if you get in any trouble in a third world country it can be a very very scary time and you are isolated and most certainly at their mercy there are plenty of other countries to see we managed by the grace of god to catch a flight out , but it cost us $800 when i checked out of this hotel ( three days early ) , i explained why the employee just shrugged his shoulders with no apology or concen and then handed me my spa bill if you do not take heed to this warning be sure to do the following prior to you leaving 1- contact your private ( work ) insurer to let them know where you are going prior to departure and get all the necessary phone numbers to contact them in case of emergency sure you call your cellular carrier and have them place you on their roaming feature so you can use your cell while down there otherwise you phone may not work not trust the hosptial workers down there , if you feel something is wrong this country is trying , but they are no where close to our level of healthcare and there lack of education on healthcare matters is evident i had done the above things and it made things easier , but i think we had some luck on our side too we have been to dr three times i guess our luck ran out this time , because you 're lucky if you do not get sick we will vacation in a first world country form now own it 's just not worth the risk to our health 
i have travelled to many , many all inclusives through the years , first staying at club meds , later on at much fancier resorts what i missed at many of the more posh places was a lively activities team it was ok if you wanted to sit on the beach or at the pool all day but i like to play games , do water aerobics and meet other people the best thing about the majestic resort was their animation team they kept you hopping with fun events , dance lessons , water aerobics etc they encouraged people to get involved and did not cancel events because they were lazy they really made the effort all the time they also had several evening events that were fun as well as for the resort itself , it is quite beautiful and well maintained the food is fair - - nothing to write home about the fact that they advertise several different restaurants is not a big deal most of the places have very similar menus i am the sole vegetarian in my family but i found the salad bars extremely boring usually all inclusives have expansive choices for non - meat eaters but this resort did not each restaurant had a salad bar but they basically consisted of lettuce , cucumber , carrots and chopped cabbage with a couple of chef 's special salads which had fish in them a little disappointing for me i am not a big drinker but i was told that the liquor was not up to par , especially the tequilla if you like to have poolside drinks delivered it does not happen here be prepared to go up to the bars yourself the major gripe with this resort was the lack of beach towels when you arrive each person is given one towel card this entitles you to one smallish towel at the pool not a bath sheet , this towel does not cover the fairly uncomfortable plastic pool chair if you come out of the pool dripping and dry yourself off with it you have to put it back on your chair wet you cannot talk the towel dispenser person into giving you two towels he is a towel security person and cannot be swayed if you take your towel poolside so you have it when you get out of the water , and it is stolen , you are told you will have to pay $25 00 for another towel so bring your own beach towels with you we also only had 2 bath sheets in the room , plus two hand towels and one wash cloth they are certainly cheap when it comes to towels also remember to bring books with you - their little library cart has very few books in english they also skimped when it came to having chalk around the pool tables ( finally a tiny chalk appeared on our 5th day there ) and the ping pong paddles were an embarrassment until late in our trip when they were finally replaced all in all , we had a fun week - the weather was glorious , the grounds were beautiful , and the staff was very friendly 
good but nothing compared to bahia next door my husband  i stayed at the majestic dec this is a very nice , clean well maintained resort but unfortunately my review is strictly based on a comparison to our stay at the bahia two years ago punta cana beaches are the best i have ever seen and i would go back but i would stay at the bahia before returning to the majestic the food was very tasty with great selection but with that said , my husband  i both came down with the majestic revenge half way through the week and medication did not seem to help we spoke to many other guests who had the same problems on a variety of levels because of the tropical storm that passed through , someone suggested that maybe the water system was compromised the staff was outstanding all very friendly and helpful we never had any problems getting drinks and the maintenance staff were always hard at work our room although very clean , we never received a towel animal or flowers or nightly turndown service one day our room did not even get maid service i agree with others that the bathroom was not very private and did become a problem when my husband  i contracted our bug i did as others suggested and took scented plug ins and scented candles as the room was a little musty smelling our balcony partially overlooked the ocean and partially the construction site the construction actually was a source of entertainment to my contruction worker husband who is in charge of health  safety many infractions in the dominican  my husband got enough pictures to make an album of how not to do things overall we made the best of things and it was nice to get away and sit on the beach for a week 
average majestic we stayed at the majestic from 1st november for 2 weeks my first impression of the hotel was that it looked lovely upon entering the room , there was a very musty smell , the rooms are large and bright but i thought they were quite ordinary the food at the hotel is mediocre - the japanese was very good , and the pasta and salads were very nice , but after 2 weeks of mainly eating pasta we were ready for a change , of note we were not sick once the beach is the best part of this hotel - the sea is a gorgeous turquoise colour and crystal clear the hotel was extremely busy whilst we were there and the beach was crowded , hoards of people walking up and down - it was like being in benidorm mid summer we found the staff mainly very friendly apart from the bartenders who were very surly i dont think we would go back to this hotel or dr , it just didnt live up to expectations the other caribbean islands i have visited were much better in the fact that once you go out of your hotel in dr its a complete mess everywhere , the roads are terrible , and nothing seems finished with so much investment in new hotels along that strech of beach why havent they sorted out the roads etc we did enjoy ourselves but have definately experienced better hotels in the caribbean 
not so majestic after all my husband and i ( early 30s ) stayed at the majestic from 8/11 to 22/11 and have vowed never to return to the dominican republic this is undoubtedly a lovely hotel , however , i would think twice about booking a holiday to the dominican if you are reading this we booked in april when this resort was receiving almost flawless reviews and as big believers in trip advisor , thought we could not go wrong and were so looking forward all year to a magic holiday the first major problem was the weather - a lot of rain and big black clouds and this kind of complex is completely dependant on sunny days weather is obviously never guarnteed to be good though , is it perhaps it was an affect of the tropical storm noel , i do not know we had food poisoning twice forcing us to cancel two excursions violent vomiting and diarrhea all through the night and following day the temperature of the food served at the buffet restaurants is worrying you spend the days when you 're well , scared to eat anything other than soup or pasta for fear of getting sick again food is a major let down at this complex mosquitos - we travel abroad each year and have never been bitten until we went to the dominican repellant does not seem to stop them either on a positive note , the rooms are lovely , amazing pool , lovely bars ( they did lack atmosphere mind you ) , great nightly shows and the casino is good although we were robbed ( are not you always i was not overly impressed with the beach - have seen a lot better we originally wanted to go to mexico but settled on the dominican as it was more affordable - i wish we had paid the extra money we always had reservations about this island in that so many people we know came back with food poisoning , but still booked thinking we would be ok maybe we were just unlucky , but unless you want to spend your days nursing the toilet bowl in your room , go somewhere else and do not be disappointed in your much awaited holiday 
do not believe the hype upon arrival everything seemed normal until we were informed our room would not be ready for 2 hours things were missing from our room when we finally got in to it we were served a complimentary fruit plate in our room without any utensils to eat it with the hotel and beach were beautiful , but could not make up for the poor service and ordinary and mediocre food getting a water glass filled seemd like a major chore we had to call daily to ensure our room even got cleaned the beach cleaners were lazy and often forgot to pick up bags of debris that eventually ended up back in the water something must have changed from the time we read all of the reviews 6 months ago and november 10, 2007 this hotel is over rated big time if your only desire is a beautiful hotel - this is the place if you have expectations for your money - you 'll be disappointed notice : beware the ugly american tourist has been replaced by the over bearing , loud , do not - care - about - your - personal - space eastern european we met very pleasant folks from spain , canada , italy , and the usa the folks from the old eastern bloc , and the like were obnoxious and rude 
beautiful resort but not paradise for us the majestic colonial resort is a beautiful resort which has a lot to offer vacationers the grounds are breathtaking and constantly being cared for and the enormous pool is truly majestic and never feels crowded the beach was lovely and you never had to worry about finding a lounger or shade area if that is where you wanted to relax the ocean temperature was actually warmer than the pool water and the beach was well taken care of and cleaned daily by staff the staff there were friendly and always courteous and always attempted to provide for your needs to the best of their ability our favorite restaurant was the gourmet restaurant and their service and four entrees offered were excellent the only consistent complaint i would have about the restaurants is that coffee is not readily available the servers would usually pour a half cup and many times it was prepoured and frequently not hot when it was served ( i wondered if the availability of coffee beans were affected by previous storms as i never noticed this at my stay in puerto plata several years ago unfortunately the weather during our stay was not ideal with lots of cloudy days and frequent heavy rains that makes your entire vacation experience less than ideal the hotel has no control over the weather but the little annoyances that you may not have noticed become more pronounced when you are spending more time wandering around the resort in the rain be prepared to wear rubber soled sneakers as the beautiful tiled hallways and walkways are extremely slippery when wet especially during downpours i do not want to sound like a complainer but would like to comment on some issues i encountered so that other guests may be able to avoid them in the future and enjoy their stay more room it was a standard jr suite in building 4 which was a ground floor room with our balcony facing the construction area that was blocked by a black netting the construction work did start early and several night went late probably trying to make up for lost hours due to heavy rainfalls ( noise was an issue if you chose to use the patio but not heard inside room ) the room is very large and we had no issues with the layout of this suite the bed was fine but the pillows could be improved the sofa is not comfortable ( if you were sitting in the sun this would not be an issue ) and the fabric covering it and the bench appeared dirty due to old stains the increased moisture and ground floor location also contributed to increased number of centipede/inchworm type creatures found inside our room throughout our stay ( the rooms were cleaned excellent by staff so cleanliness was not the contributing factor here we were unfortunately assigned a room that had a door that would accomodate guests that wanted adjoining rooms the door is extremely hollow and we could hear conversations of the guests in that room as if they were sitting right next to you circumstances had one family with children/baby crying which was tolerable but the last night we were awakened to new drunken guests screaming and cursing at each other several times during the night when we checked in we were told that the hotel was fully booked so we did not request a room change i would recommend requesting room on upper floors and not accept adjoing door suite to eliminate the problems i experienced entertainmentthe animation team works hard but i only did two dancing lessons as daytime activities i did use the gym but was disappointed that the treadmill kept shutting off on me after manually trying to increase speed to increase my pace i chose to walk around the perimeter of resort for exercise but that was interrupted by heavy downpours the shows at night were not impressive and it seemed like the only other choice of entertainment was the sax and keyboard player who were good but it did become a little repetitive after two nights no activities available during rain that we were aware of medical emergenciesdo not travel to punta cana unless you are independently wealthy or have travel insurance that covers unanticipated illnesses my husband became violently ill with a bacterial gastrointestinal illness i do not think it matters how or where he picked up this bacteria but i can assure you he has traveled all over the world including many third world countries and knows standard precautions to take to avoid these type illnesses the hotel md was a pleasure to deal with and was very competent my husband was sent to private hospital for iv antibiotics and fluids by ambulance the cost of these services were $400 and charged to my credit card i just by chance remembered that i had purchased travel insurance for the first time due to threat of hurricanes and was pleasantly surprised that it covered medical emergencies too the hotel doctor did tell me to have the hospital contact the insurance company which i did when i arrived the billing person kept telling me they did not take any us travel insurances but i insisted they call prior to giving them my credit card for guaranteed payment prior to treatment she then informed me the insurance would pay but again wanted my credit card which i was reluctant to present the hospital was very clean and of course we did have some communication difficulties as we do not speak spanish fluently but nothing insurmountable the biggest problem was trying to be discharged as they wanted guaranteed payment but were not accepting verbal and written confirmation of payment by insurance company and appeared to be insisting on charging my credit card as opposed to insurance payment guarantee i actually spoke to insurance case manager several times via telephone and she said they had never encountered this before and she had dealt with same facility on prior occasions as we finally left the hospital i observed another frustrated family dealing with same issue of insurance guantee that we had i recognize that this facility does not want vacationers to disappear without receiving payment but when they are dealing with internationally known insurance companies there has to be a better way to a confirm coverage without causing patients and their families the increased stress i would have been willig to use my credit card if that was procedure to get reimbursement from insurance company but they stated they already guaranteed payment and i did not want to be double billed for services i also was not able to receive a written itemized list of supplies and cost of services when we left hospital i think a variety of circumstances such as the rainy weather , less than ideal room location , one bad meal resulting in bacterial infection and hospital experience will not bring me back to punta cana in the near future if i did choose to return and wanted a quiet relaxing vacation and could be guaranteed an upper level floor without adjoining doors i would try the majestic again as it really is a magnificent property suggestions to the management team at the majestic would be to make sure you have information and maps of property in english and other languagues for new arrival guests also it would be a great if they actually had drink menus at the bars so guests could experiment with new drinks and know what types of beverages were available and ingredients in them 
very pretty resort , but got sick my husband and i stayed at the majestic from (8/26-9/02) we arrived before the 3p check in time and our room wasnt ready so they sent us down to lunch and we were still able to be in our rooms by about 2:00 the staff was very nice and worked very hard to please unfortunatly we got sick , my husband worse than me , so much so that i took him to the doctor on site instead of just giving him the antibiotics she gave him some injection that he had a bad allergic reaction too so that was scary being in a foreign place and being at the mercy of a doctor who you dont fully trust my husband responded well to the antibiotics and was only out of commission for about a day and a half i also had bad stomach issues and broke out into hives but after the disaster with the doctor i decided to self treat the grounds were kept very well , the pool was fantasic and the beach was clean and beautiful the food was pretty tasty but just didnt agree with our stomachs i loved the japenese restaurant , but make sure you make reservations right away , we only got in because someone didnt show up the french restuarant wasnt great to me , they did have a delicious chocolate cake dessert though the breakfast buffet was good i didnt care for the continental breakfast in the restuarant by the beach , the food never looked fresh and despite having an expiration date of mid september my husband got a molded yogurt and the staff at the resturant made no apologies for it i would just advise those who havent travelled internationly to come prepared with any medicines that you think you may need particularly anti biotics and stomach medications 
beach activities this was our second trip to punta cana our resort was beautiful it was really fun being there my family and i usually went to the beach i have 1 child who is 13 years old , and when she was bored she would join in the beach activities these activities were very fun and active the games were setup by the entertainment group at the majestic however , there was only 1 problem 1 woman who worked for the entertainment group , called alexandra , did not let the kids participate in the activities she would only let them participate after 3 parents complained and told her that our kids came to the beach to have fun and to join in the activities usually , adults do not play games the kids are the ones who do enjoy doing those things alexandra was very rude and usually she rolled her eyes at everyone who insisted on letting children play the games i do not think that this woman should be working as an entertainer if she 's not letting people at certain ages play everyone else from the entertainment group let the kids play the rest of the experience at the majestic was excellent 
disappointing having read the reviews on trip advisor when i was planning my trip to majestic colonial , punta cana , i was really looking forward to my vacation there unfortunately i was very disappointed the concierge staff was very matter of fact and the staff of the hotel was not friendly the rooms were very spacious but you have no privacy at all because the bathrooms are wide open ( no wall or doors ) and if you should want to get up in the middle of the night you will wake everyone in your room the toilet bowl is in an enclosed area 2 feet by 3 feet ( this is not an exageration ) , a big person will have great difficulty manuvering the refrigerator in the room did not refrigerate any thing after a rain storm we had a leak in the room they claim to have seven restaurants but what they really have are three restaurants and two huge buffet restaurants all severely understaffed the food however is the same where ever you go and is mediocre my all family got food poisoning and we spent the last three days of our vacation throwing up a bottle of sun tan lotion is $28 75% of the people who go to the theatre can not see the stage if you want a decent seat you must get there one hour before the show and since the shows are very amaturish , it is not worth the time invested we decided to take a safari tour with a company called turinter it was a total rip off and at one point we were attacked by some haitian sugar plantation workers brandishing machetes and demanding tips the tour guide never intervened to protect the members of his group if you are going with children there is a $70,00 a day fee for each child to enter the childrens park although the beach was ok ( nothing spectacular ) i would have enjoied it more if i di not have to explain to my children why a number of women were topless we should have been warned about that 
beautiful , but hard to understand after reading all the reviews listed at this site and getting a special upgrade offer , we decided the majestic colonial would be an ideal place to spend our week - long vacation in punta cana i noticed on the reviews that everyone loved the pool , but the food and staff got some negative remarks i chalked this negativity up to high standards first , the positives the resort was beautiful nice landscaping , great pool , very nice rooms we had two jacuzzi tubs ( one inside , one outside ) we were right by the pool , so we were able to open our patio doors , roll our lounge chairs to the edge of the pool and jump in that was nice they also had a variety of restaurants you could always find a place to get a drink , if that 's important to you now for the negatives the food at the buffet was ok i 'm a picky eater , so it was just a matter of finding what you like but there were enough options at the resort that it really was not a problem yes , the mattress and pillows were pretty hard , again , not a big deal we were awoken every morning by housekeeping the front doors hardly kept out any noise although you could barely hear anything from the patio or the other rooms they experienced brief power outages throughout the day we would reset the alarm clock 3-4 times a day the ocean was pretty rough in this area , but it was pretty enough to make you forget my biggest gripe however , was the language barrier i understand that we are visiting an area that is spanish - speaking and i am the first to give credit to them , because i figure they know more english than i know spanish ( i only took one year of spanish , my boyfriend took two ) however , the language difference was a huge problem here first off , our room keys worked , so we went back to the front desk and tried to explain they did not understand , but soon swiped the cards and sent us off again needless to say , it took four trips back and forth from our room to the front desk before they understood that the scratch on the back of the card is why the one card would not work through out the trip we had a hard time relaying our message to just about everyone we had a small leak from the ceiling in our room , which i alerted housekeeping about , because it was dripping onto the outlet the first gentleman told the girl who cleaned our room she brought bug spray she later sent maintenance , who simply said no comprendo , eventhough he could see the leak i inquired about a shopping center that opened in december with guest services i wondered if there were many stores open there all she kept responding was yes , it 's wednesday , they are open needless to say , we spent $40 on a taxi , only to find out there were only about 12 stores open one night we decided to check out the light nite fast food restaurant we were the first ones in line , the gentlemen took my boyfriends order , but not mine then when i asked for a burger plain , he started spewing words and stormed in back later two coworkers came to see him and he turned around , pointed at us and yelled all kinds of words ( probably a good thing , i could not understand ) i so wanted to tell someone , but the problem was noone would understand me time after time , language was huge issue even those people that did speak english , did not seem to understand what it was they were saying you could repeat the same words to them and they were confused so after a week , i was very frustrated and did not want to talk to anyone overall , the resort was very nice , but i would not go back because i do not like feeling left in the dark 
still trying to figure out how it got a 2007 travel award we stayed at the majestic from may 23- june 3, 2007 i am still trying to figure out how it was rated 2007 travel award seriously , i stayed in punta can 2 other times and this was rated 3rd the iberostar bavaro was excellent and the other was the melia this came in 3rd place food wasnt so great and the grounds were not anything great not much music going on in the day or activities would not recommend this hotel although if this is your first time at a resort in punta cana , you may like it but there are definitely others out there better than this 
just ok - - totally honest opinion having traveled to several countries i am well aware of the cultural differences in food , culture however , i would have to say that that our time in the dr was just ok i read the reviews on trip advisor and went there with an open mind since i know that you cannot please everyone the hotel - - a++ for the beauty of the grounds , the pool , the beach , the rooms and the overall layout of the resort i have no complaints whatsoever about any of these the pool is huge and very clean , the beach is stunning and very clean the resort itself is gorgeous no problem at all getting chairs , shaded huts , etc the food - - i 'd give it a c at best trust me when i tell you that i was not expecting amercianized food but even their local fare just was not good i would say edible at best fruit - - excellent - - you ca not go wrong here chatueaubriand was very good and the french restaurant , while not spectacular , was by far the best the sushi at the japanese place was also decent the drinks are made with bottom of the barrell liquor they have stoli if you ask but everything else is the cheapest available my husband did get sick but i am going to chalk that up to too much alcohol and sun but lunch at the beach restaurant is not good at all there were clearly rotted vegetables , things that should have been kept cool just sitting out baking in the heat and not a great selection stick to the main lobby buffet service : f the front desk staff was very good and helpful i was truly made to feel as though i was inconveniencing anyone else including the bartenders they look at you solely as money and that 's it i am a firm believer in tipping as we are told these people are making $50- $60 a week , however , i will not tip just because at no point did i feel as though anyone was happy to serve there is zero beach or poolside service you have to get your drinks yourself the entertainment staff do work hard the michael jackson show is by far the best i have seen at any resort anywhere shopping : f - if there was a grade lower than f they would get it there is a shopping area just outside the resort they hound you to point where you ca not even look i understand they are trying to make a living but they are beyond agressive we left after 10minutes because they do not leave you alone for 1sec pay a little extra on the resort and save the hassel of being harrassed the main thing we did not like is that we felt like we were in a prison you cannot leave the resort under any circumstances unless you are taking a tour you are hounded for money from the second you get off the plane to the minute you leave it was a nice place to rest and relax but we will not return to dr 
do not come here for the food my girlfriend and i stayed at the majestic from february 9th to february 16th the best way to describe this hotel is ??lose , but no cigar? at a glance , everything about the resort looks amazing however , if you take a closer look , you??l find that this place has many flaws i can deal with most of the flaws the food was by far the worst thing about this resort , followed by the not so private bathrooms , and the fact that they reserved the wrong room for us the foodbefore choosing this resort , we read all the reviews relating to the food choices and found that the reviews were mixed we got the impression that the negative reviews were a result a few snobby people who expected way too much from an all - inclusive resort on the other hand , we got the impression that the super positive reviews were the result of a few people who still consider spaghetti and pizza a foreign food we figured that the food was probably of average quality ( at least the buffet food ) ??bout on par with or just below the quality of food you would find at restaurants such as friday?? , bennigan?? , ruby tuesday , and others just like it??othing spectacular , but decent we expected the specialty restaurants to be slightly better we figured that a five star hotel should at least be able meet these food requirements??ot too much to ask??ight now i don?? consider myself a food connoisseur , but i know bad food when i taste it most of the food here is terrible , has no flavor??ust completely bland and boring so , unfortunately , i have to side with the few snobby people?? guess that makes me a food snob if food is important to you , then i would not recommend this place for you however , i?? sure some of you probably already made your reservations or think my review is flawed if that?? that case , then read my reviews below of each restaurant as a guide while at the resort??iterally , print this review and take it with you??ou??l thank me as a quick tip , the best food at the resort is at the dominican food at the mexican restaurant??o figure??he dominican?? know how to make dominican food breakfast - there is only one place to eat breakfast , which is at the main buffet building not to worry though??he breakfast is very good and always fresh the omelet stations ( more than one ) can prepare eggs of any style almost every breakfast item you can think of is available such as pancakes , french toast , waffles , crapes , sausage , bacon , pastries , awesome fruity milkshakes , an assortment of breads , and much much more the breakfast seems to accommodate all the major nationalities that attend this resort ( fyi??he dominican coffee they serve is not high quality dominican coffee??ou have to leave the resort to find good coffee??ut i like the coffee from mcdonalds better than starbucks , so what do i know ) lunch - you have two options at lunch??ross and disgusting lunch is served at the main buffet building and at the restaurant near the beach called la hispaniola the lunch at the main buffet serves basically the same thing every day??lmost all of it is gross??ood enough for a dog however , sometimes they do serve dominican food , which is very good??ut it?? hard to find because they don?? label it as dominican food as for la hispaniola , don?? be confused by the name??his place does not serve any latin food they serve hamburgers on hard buns , hotdogs , and french fries on the plus side , both restaurants do have very good desserts dinner - for dinner you have eight options? most are disgusting ( option 8 is the best ) option 1 ( the main buffet ) ? you guessed it??ross it was the same thing every night options 2 and 3 ( the rodeo grill steakhouse and tres carabelas ) - both are located at the la hispaniola location , which is split into the two restaurants for dinner at the steakhouse , i go the steak , which was about on par with a steak that you would find at a breakfast diner like ihop i ordered my steak as medium rare???? glad to report that it did not get me sick my girlfriend ordered the pork chops??hey were dry , tough and tasteless tres carabelas is a seafood restaurant i got the lobster and she got the shrimp both portions were very small??owever , they did offer to give us a second helping??ven though we thought this place was a little better , we declined as we were still not impressed??his was no rudy tuesday option 4 ( the french restaurant ) - we didn?? get a chance to eat there so i have no comment ( reservations required ) option 5 ( hibachi grill ) - the hibachi grill located in the asian restaurant all the food is loaded with way too much soy sauce??ike licking a salt lick the egg rolls and dumplings they serve were once frozen if you know what japanese food from a hibachi grill should taste like , then you won?? like this place on the other hand , if you??e the type that has never used chopsticks before , then you??l probably love this place ( reservations required ) option 6 ( chinese food and sushi ) - this restaurant is also located in the asian restaurant as well , but you don?? need reservations they serve fake sushi ( california rolls??o raw fish ) and chinese food we did not try the chinese food or the fake sushi options 7 and 8 ( taino caribbean restaurant ) - the featured food at this restaurant is mexican food ( option 7) ??ut take my word on this??he mexican food they serve makes taco bell seem like a gourmet restaurant option 8 is by far the best food to eat at the resort option 8 is the dominican soup and salad bar that is located inside the mexican restaurant??ut don?? be fooled , the dominican food they serve is not just soup and salad??hey serve pork , chicken , beef , goat ( just try it??ts very good ) , sweet plantains , beans and rice remember , when traveling to a different county , you should try the local food??hy??ecause that?? what the know how to cook funny story , i told some guy at the asian restaurant that only good food at the resort was the dominican soup and salad bar??e responded with these exact words ?? know?? agree with you???? one of the people that makes this whole resort possible????asically , the guy , who i think was an owner or investor , told me that that food at this resort sucks and agreed that the best food was the dominican food at the mexican restaurant the beachthe beach is gorgeous??t least if you don?? mind the occasional seaweed build up up and down the entire beach ( at all the punta cana resorts ) , seaweed drifts down the entire coast the amount of seaweed along the majestic?? stretch of the beach varied from day to day??ometimes it was hard to avoid it as it wrapped around my ankles however , it wasn?? a big deal on most days the seaweed does build up on the beach??ind of ugly , but they rake it up every few days even so , a nicer resort would remove the seaweed each morning as for the water itself , it?? crystal clear ( when calm ) i?? not sure what the temperature was , but it was prefect and refreshing one caution though??f you??e bring your children , keep in mind that the water gets deep pretty fast??t was over my head about 20 to 25 feet out (7 to 8 meters ) there weren?? too many rocks?? only found one area were i couldn?? avoid stepping on some rocks??hey are hard to see as they are the same color as the sand as for the beach , the sand is white and soft??ots of chairs and umbrellas however , on some days , small roots are exposed that are annoying to step on??ther days , the roots were covered by the sand??robably covered the same day the seaweed was raked off the beach other than that , the beach is generally clean??otel workers are always walking around picking up trash ( fyi , if you want an umbrella , place your towel on the chair under the umbrella before 10am??lthough some people dropped their towels at 9am and didn?? return to their spot till hours later??lease don?? be one of those people ) there are plenty of activities on the beach every morning around 10:30am , an aerobics class is held on the beach keep in mind that the instructor plays the same load music every morning that can be heard from every point on the beach??ind of annoying when you are trying to relax or recover from a night of drinking??o bring your ipod to drown out the sound this lasts for about an hour 
falls short in important areas my review is based on placing the majestic along side all of the resorts in the caribbean that i have visited - - this is not a how much fun did we have here review , it 's a how does the majestic stack up against area resorts in general review our stay : january 8-14, 2006 positives : the professional and candid photos of the resort really are a true reflection of the property the main building , the grounds , and public areas overall are quite lovely the thoughtful architectural design and physical layout ensures that nearly all rooms at the resort have a view of either the pool , the beach , or both ( there are a few very unfortunate exceptions where rooms face an ugly neighboring hotel building , access road and/or chain link security fence the beach is large , the pool is huge , and we had little problem finding chairs at either - - it was particularly easy to locate chairs on the beach the service and the staff who directly interact with guests ( animation team , bartenders , restaurant personnel ) are very good negatives : despite the nice overall appearance of the rooms ( marble floors , large walk - in shower , double vanities ) , the items that you actually need and/or use in the rooms are poor or nonexistent beds are hard as a rock - - literally pillows are not actually pillows but thin half inch slices of non supportive foam ( you need 4 or more to equal one 'normal ' down pillow ) , you may or may not get towels our room , despite assurances that more would be sent ( that never were ) averaged 2 bath towels and one hand towel for 2 adults , this is not adequate never a wash cloth , only twice in 6 nights did we have a bath mat ( and the marble is way too slippery when wet to not have that ) , and twice our dirty towels were just not changed ( we had to use our pool towels bedspread was dirty throughout the stay , and on one day sheets were put on our bed that had lipstick all over the top of them when the bed was turned down , there was no possible way that it could have been missed by maid service - - but was left nonetheless fittings and room finishings are below par we had a broken ceramic lamp in our room that the maid kept trying to rebalance on it 's severed base - - it fell over on my head the first night and we requested replacement - - which never did arrive although the lamp was removed on the 4th day ( they left the shade cheap furniture is also already showing wear , slip covers are ill - fit and untidy , missing trim pieces were evident in the bathroom food and drinks : this is where the resort is most seriously lacking if your idea of 'good ' is akin to 'a lot ' , then you wo not be disappointed with the food and drinks however , if what you want on vacation is fresh , local , interesting , tasty , well prepared , cuisine - - go elsewhere the quality of the food at the buffets is on par with hospital food and/or public cafeterias the quality ranges from disgusting to below average at lunch time , average at breakfast , and below average at dinner the most passable dinners we had were at the rodeo grill ( steak ) and the japanese restaurant - - where you are lucky to even get a reservation ( we were told both reservation - only restaurants were totally booked during our entire when we attempted to make reservations upon arrival ) neither is worth writing home about , but at least the food is average drinks  wine : the wine is plentiful , but it is utterly horrid if you are truly a wine drinker ( and i do not mean 'wine snob ' , i mean if you like anything above a $4 bottle or box ) premium brands of liquor are advertised but do not count on their availability in sum : if you like a spring break type atmosphere , your goal is to 'par - tay ' and you do not care about food and drink quality - - you 'll have a good time ( i think i may have enjoyed a stay here when i was in my early 20s ) if you seek a relaxing , romantic , comfortable or pampering get away with good food  drinks , this is not the place if trip advisor allowed , i 'd give the majestic 2 
do not expect too much the majestic colonial is an average all - inclusive having stayed at a number of other all inclusives on other islands , it appears that , at least at this resort , the dr needs to do some catching up we paid for an ocean front room which was lovely ( after we went back to the front desk and demanded what we had paid for ) , spacious , clean and with a personal jaguzzi while the beach was lovely , the high winds never stopped during our entire trip , making walks on the beach tiring and painful ( sand hitting you constantly ) there were plenty of lounges because everyone seemed to be at the more sheltered pools , where lounges were at a premium the water was incredibly rough with whitecaps and rollers inside the breakwater food was acceptable to poor , depending what and where you ate everything was cold , unless you had it prepared at one of the chef stations they seem to do fish well and the french restaurant was good the buffet was the same every breakfast , lunch and dinner the bars had no snacks , what few hor d 'ouvres they put out in one spot in the evening were inedible glad we were only there for 5 days , a week would have been way too much 
you need to consider the food before going we are a 28 year old couple from boston , stayed at the majestic for one week in december before making your decision to go to this resort , you need to be aware of how bad the food is i did not listen to the reviews about the food before i left because it was a very affordable price for such a beautiful resort and beach the buffets are big , so one would think you could find something , but it 's all awful i never got sick , most people i met there did not , but it 's hard to eat cafeteria grade food all day long when the rest of you is in luxurious resort mode i tried to not let this bring me down on my vacation , but i would have given anything to have known , i would have brought snacks in my luggage even a loaf of bread , for a pbj would have tasted fantastic the only restaurant that was good was the japanese , but you can only go there once the food at the french restaurant is a disaster i met a woman on vacation who had been to 11 other all inclusives she said the food does not get any better than this if they only had a grill on the beach with real meat hamburgers and hotdogs , i would probably go back the resort and beach are both amazing just like the pictures i had an hour massage on the beach in a palapa hut it was the best massage i 've ever had definately worth the 70 the rooms themselves are above and beyond they could easily pass for the ritz or four seasons if you get a room without a pool view do not be dissapointed the pool is very loud , it was nice to get away from all the noise the beach is great for long walks there are hundreds of palapas and you never have a problem finding comfy chairs for the women , do not forget to pack some summer dresses at night , most people dress up 
as expected but probably the last time for an all - inclusive coming on the heels of our stay last year at sunscape the beach , we decided to go back to punta cana since i could not get a room at sunscape , tried the majestic some observations :1 the service level is probably as good as it is going to get at this type of hotel in the dominican both the beach and pool areas were well maintained and very pleasurable i cannot understand prior compaints about the roughness of the surf or comparisons of it to the atlantic ocean beaches of the northeast other than swimming in a pond or a lake this is as mellow as the ocean gets pool water temp is not optimal as the sun is not as intense in the winter and therefore you cannot hang in the pool as long food is at best mediocre given my experience last year at sunscape , we expected marginal food options however , this was worse than sunscape less diversity in salads , no nightly variation ( little ) everything seemed old and cold , if it was just slightly fresher and hotter it would have made it a little better we bought alot of snacks ( pretzels , nuts , candy , etc ) which served us well in between meals i do not mind paying the prices ( week of x - mas , larger suite ) because to be in the sun and have the beach access is worth it however , this will be my last all - inclusive i need more control over my food choices and like to explore my son will be old enough to do that in the future 
but i do not recommend it unless you speek spanish my wife and i booked our trip to majestic in april , and were there from july 21st thru 27th after 3 months of anxious waiting , it was a very big let down i wil note that the resort itself is beautiful the pool is awesome , the beach is perfect the room was clean and large with a great view ( we had an ocean front/view ) now for the negatives :1 i will start with the language issues first , because in my opinion , this is what really made our vacation as bad as it was not only do 95% of the staff speak spanish only , but 95% of the guests as well as stated in a review before mine , it is very hard to meat people , drink at the bar with people , and get involved in the pool games and activities when you are truly the only americans and english speaking out of the group to give a perfect example , they had bingo at the pool , and the letters and numbers were called in spanish only now , im not a big fan of bingo , but this is just an example when the staff does try to translate , which isnt very often because they must not feel the need being that all the guests speek spanish , you cant understand them anyway my wife and i like to meet people , and spend time socially with other people , and we found it almost impossible for this reason , we chose not to do any of the excursions and for this reason , we will not go back to punta cana last year , we went to cancun and had the time of our life i highly recommend cancun the riu caribe was awesome i expected a lot more from a 5 star resort yes , they had lots of choices , but the taste of the food was not very good the meats were very rough , seafood not very good i dont know if i was spoiled ffrom the riu in cancun last year , but this did not match up i still have an upset stomach the air conditioning in the room did not get cold enough i like to come in from the beach or pool , where it is very hot , to a nice cold room the air conditioners here max out at a certain temperature (19 degrees celcious ) and that is it i had trouble sleeping most nights because the room temperature was very unconfortable after the first night , i tried explaining the problem to the staff , and nothing got fixed i realy dont think it was a problem with the air conditioning unit i just think that they set it so that the room will not get any cooler than the 19 degrees celcious it may be fine for others , but not me and my wife is always cold at home , and she agreed that it was way to warm night club played spanish music only i wasnt going to write a review , because i am not a negative person but when you spend 2 or 3 thousand dollars on a vacation that you only get once a year , you expect more and when you dont get it , theres really nothing you can do except wait untill next year it was a big let down i hope this review helps if you are spanish speaking , you will have a much better time here again , it is a bautiful resort , we just couldnt get passed the launguage difference next year , back to the riu in cancun 
ok but not the best the hotel itself is absolutley beautiful staff do not speak very much english at all rooms are beautiful and very comfortable casino small but loved it no did not win but did provide good fun and the shows were pretty good especially the michael jackson show - a do not miss most important is ifyou like to use a wash cloth bring from home called to get one and they do not have any at all just large hand towels too large for using as wash cloth but towels are huge and plush and better than any other posh places i have stayed the food was ok nothing to brag about did not care for the daily lunch buffet by beach and steak house basically terrible service and after we finished had to go to regular buffet since starving i had just been to mexixco in april and restuarants there were like real restaurants not a place to get salad from bar and dessert from dessert bar they really need to pick up on the service end everyone there was very nice though pool fabulous as well as beach but if you want someplace wher they wait on you do not stay here i never knew their were all inclusives with service on beach , at the pool and free room service room service here is available but very limited and you pay extra very safe enviroment but would not bring kids if they are picky eaters we did decide the main large buffett area was the best bet for being able to find something everyone may like ( other than children ) would consider coming again but would be better prepared bring snacks for room as not always something open when you are hungry too many other places to go and see so may not be back here again 
stayed at this hotel from october 30 - until nov 7th , went with my boyfriend and three of my girlfriends had a great time , the beach is amazing the pools and the grounds were well maintained our room was clean the aircondioning leaked but we just used a towel to soak it up did not really bother us much the food was ok some of us had stomach issues immodium is a good idea the staff were great always willing to help you out thanks to franklin ( entertainment staff ) for teaching us how to dance they have a really nice spa for massages , hair braiding ect ect went on the swim with shark/stingray excursion - - - loved it and we went on the jeep safari really shows you the dominican life the vendors are very pushy , and will grab you as you walk by just have to be very stern with them and they will leave you alone the nightly entertainment was alright some nights better than others but the bar has chicken wings yummy the disco was alright i went to the halloween party - - - it was a good time the only thing we found is that the hotel is far away from things so other than excursions not much to do did walk down the beach about an hour and found a big flea market did some bartering and came home with some nice paintings so all in all it was a good trip lots of rest and relaxation mixed with a few excursions 
long story short : our luggage was left at the front for about 2 hours unattended when they told us it would be brought up like everyone else 's , had to change rooms 5 times ( should have been more but by the 5th , i was fed - up - that resulted in a lot of bug bites since the balcony door would not close properly ) and the tiling outdoors and indoors=deathtrap also , the hotel reception hardly speaks any english , was rude to my mother when she tried to locate me and , as a result , was trying to find me for 3 days just because of horrible disorganization on their part i received no compensation for everything my friend and i had to go through 
rat a tat tat we went there in 2006 for a wedding there were close to 20 in our party all but 5 ended up with flu - like symptoms we stayed 2 weeks , were bored by the second week and wishing we were home we also saw a rat that is right , a rat , on the overhang above the stage area ( also the roof to the mexican outdoor restaurant at the time ) our first room was moldy and we got moved the elevators did not work the only saving grace was the beautiful beach and the fun we had in the water oh might i add , during the wedding they deflated some part of boat pontoon or something and it was like letting helium out of a gigantic balloon and extremely loud right during the vows 
barcelo premium - a whole new meaning to all inclusive services we transferred to this hotel from dreams after just 5 days , see my review about that nightmare we arrived very hopeful and at face value it was a vast improvement its appearance , staff and facilities were more in line with a 4*+ which it had been rated the food was plentiful and always hot , the pool was lovely and had a quiet and a more lively one , with a separate water park for kids , which makes a difference the beach is good but unless their is a development adjacent then it wo not be clean and alas like dreams if you take a walk to the left its strewn with rubbish , even what i can only describe to be a piece from the side of an aeroplane its such a waste so the food was good , the staff were pleasant and you were not harassed to partipate in anything , only the vendors that the hotel allow on site to sell local products is intimidating as they do not like being told no thanks so what could possibly be wrong well there is the fact that at the weekends the hotel sell the rooms to dominicans for $10- $15 per night and they take over the pool area and are very rude we had to move from sunbathing because a full family surrounded us and literally forced us out then they take the food from the restaurants on the day they check out , filling take - away cups and plates with whatever is removable but that 's not it , barcelo premium have taken the term all inclusive to new limits with , wait for it , resident female and male prostitutes with the latter selling drugs as well and boosting to guests of making $500 dollars in a day selling drug do not think that they selling of these services is discrete , far from it my husband and a friend was approached at the lobby bar 2 by female prostitutes using mobile phone to communicate room number , i was sitting not very far away the male prostitute tried to grab my friends arm and drag her into a room like the locals the prostitutes get a room for $10-15 per night , they stay there and then move on after a few rounds doing a circuit of the hotels in the area i ca not believe that hotel management and even the tour operators allow this pratice given that it is a hotel for families and couples , its not your 18-30 holiday the day we check out there was a hysterical english girl in the lobby , she had woken up with a rat on her i rest my case about the dominican republic tour operators need to think long and hard about promoting this country and how rigorous are there checks that they miss prostitutution and drug selling at a 4*+ resort do not go to the dominican republic , tourists should stay away and it might prompt the government to seriously think about cleaning it up and putting in proper road infrastructures t our operators get your act together about your selection process 
read this for the truth we stayed at this hotel 21st september 08 and read many conflicting reports on this website concerning the hotel that we felt we wanted to add our opinion the hotel is marketed as a four star hotel the rooms allocated to guests staying with our operator , thomson tui , were in the older part of the hotel and this is where the problem lies these rooms are old and tired , and to make matters worse have very poor housekeeping if you stay in these rooms then you are staying in a 2* room and a bad one at that our initial room smelt damp and unclean on inspection of the a/c unit i noticed mould build - up inside the unit?? vent shaft , the bed was ??nackered? to say the least , pubic hair in the bath , cracked mouldy tiles etc etc etc we rejected the room and were told if we wanted a room in the new wing then we would have to pay $30 per person per night extra or we could have another room in the older wing , we accepted the latter this room initially seemed an improvement - until it rained within one hour the bathroom ceiling started leaking in several places ( the room was not on the top floor ) causing the bathroom floor to flood we returned to reception to complain and we were eventually allocated a modern room in the refurbished wing free of charge these rooms are good modern rooms and what we were expecting from a 4* hotel the room however did have its problems , a water leak coming from the rsg ( reinforced steel girder ) , and positioned next to a main walkway close to the casino we couldn?? face moving again so lived with it one rainy afternoon we were bored and walked past the older rooms the housemaids were cleaning to check them out it appeared all the older rooms were tired and unloved so this confirmed to us we had not experienced the only two bad rooms in the hotel i have stayed in many hotels both on business and pleasure , expensive and budget and can state the older rooms in this hotel are below par , anyone who disagrees is extremely naive food wise we managed to try out 5 of the 6 themed restaurants , all of these were very good especially the paris the buffet restaurant was good quality , but lacked variety and consisted of the same food every day lunch or dinner pool and beach area very well looked after majority of the staff were very friendly and i would question anyone who says on this website that the staff are rude i witnessed a few holidaymakers ( mostly american?? ) speaking to the staff like dirt , so what do they expect entertainment is held in an impressive large modern theatre the house band was dreadful but the entertainment team/dancers were very good especially the michael jackson impersonator to summarise , if you stay here moan like hell ( or pay the upgrade fee of $30 per person per night ) and get a room in the new wing , then you will have a good holiday in a 4* hotel that you were expecting 
cheap is cheap - old is old first of all should anyone complain about an all inclusive for 297 00 plus taxes per person probably not because you shouldnt expect much at this price level hotel room was sub par buffet was sub par , alacartes were average , pools and beach were superberb but then i am comparing to resorts we have spent 5 times as much at overall a good value dont drink local water hotel is good to supply bottled water everywhere in the hotel and your room maid service was really lax 
dream beach - very ordinary hotel just returned from the barcelo premium in punta cana , honestly cannot see what was premium about it this is no doubt a dream resort with a beach that stretches beyond where the eye can see , you would be hard pressed to match the view we went with a family of 4 expecting great things from this hotel , do not we checked into the hotel with relative ease and after a long journey were very tired our room i have to say did not meet with our expectations you should note that blocks 4-7 are not the renovated blocks and are in desperate need of repair i immediately insisted on being moved , the ceiling was partially falling down in the bathroom and would have been dangerous to stay in we were moved on request to a second set of rooms that were actually no better and by this time i was almost at the end of my patience i had to insist that i was only staying in these rooms until the next day and insisted on being moved please ensure that you check with your travel agent as it appears that ours did not have a contract with the hotel for the renovated rooms , so they said this was not told to us when we booked or mentioned in our brochure i have to say that tanya , one of the hotel managers was excellent in her care and ensured that the very next day we were moved to the renovated block thank goodness you would think the room , although renovated had a distinct smell , one of damp the whole time , the cleaners did a very basic clean , never any smell of cleaning materials or evidence that any were used so we never got rid of the fusty smell three of the four of us had upset tummies after day three so you do need to be very careful with the food , there were lots of guests with the same complaint , the doctor on site always had a queue of people to see i eventually survived the whole holiday on 'chip butties ' , the last thing you expect to have to eat what made it worse is that there was a constant smell of food being cooked from morning until night , the only place to escape the smell was on the beach when you have an upset stomach the last thing you needed was to smell food cooking i have to say that the older part of the hotel needs a good clean and the soft furnishing all over need replacing as they are also visibly dirty , not appealing or inviting to sit on as they currently are bar staff were a little hit and miss , it is almost expected that you should tip , in my opinion you would tip if you receive good service , not tip to get good service on the up side the entertainment staff were excellent themselves but were very limited as to what extertainment was actually provided i had two girls who were some what bored to say the least with what was on offer in the evening we would go back to punta cana but not this hotel again there is building work going on down the beach , the first complex due to be finished in december this year and the second compex to be finished next december , these should be stunning and worth waiting for if you are going to punta cana unfortunately the description on trip advisor does not reflect what is offered at this hotel unless you are paying for a premium suite and even then this may not live up to your expectations our thanks go to aldo , leandro , caesar , juan carlos , franklin and modesto who managed to keep us smiling and who we would go back to see if we ever went back , they kept us sane and entertained with their hilarious antics 
stayed 2 long my family went to punta cana because so many people raved about its beautiful beaches , so we decided to go we stayed seven days and six nights ( way too long ) first , the resort was beautiful , but after a couple of days you get very bored with the hotel although i love the beach and the pool , all the entertainment involved the pool or the beach you can only do pool aerobics for so many days also , you couldn?? venture outside of the hotel unless you were going on a tour , or was familiar with the town unlike other places i visited , you can walk the streets or visit other hotels i felt confined to this hotel second , we have a teenager , and there were no activities for teens no teen club , teen disco , nothing ( if you have teenagers , this makes for a very long vacation ) the game room was lackluster : pool tables , table tennis , a few board games , and a air hockey machine that looked 10 years old the game room was adjacent to a ??ports bar? please do not be fooled by the sports bar pictures on - line , the sports bar was horrible very very horrible because our trip was in the middle of the olympics , they showed almost none of it the sports bar only played soccer , and that was in spanish they had espn deportes playing , but i don?? speak much spanish , so i couldn?? understand it so i won?? go on and on and on ( because i can ) , the sports bar looks more like your home basement , a tv , sofa , and an old pool table third , almost no one spoke english this is partly my fault because i assumed that if you are going to a resort that many americans go to , everyone will speak english it was hard ordering drinks that were not on the menu , like a club soda fourth , the room the room was nice , clean and had a modern look , with a couple of problems : (1) the room was riddled with bugs ( bring bug spray ) (2) the double beds are not american sized double beds , they are much smaller my husband and i were very uncomfortable sleeping in those beds i guess it doesn?? help that i?? 5? and he?? 6? lastly , the food was ok , lots of it but it was hard for me to find dishes that i like ( since i don?? eat pork , and rarely eat beef ) i know there is a lot of negative feedback , but overall if you love the beach , the pool , and leave your teenager home you will love this resort i mention there was a hurricane name fay that passed by 
loved pools beach , hated buffet food firstly the beach and pools lovely and clean , sports pool not as clean but the staff do try it is the fault of clients un - renovated rooms okay but clean need the refurb , didnt get allocated new rooms but all good comments trapeze and climbing wall very good staff there brilliant especially paul beach towels get them early otherwise they dont have them dont complain to the reception staff about anything because they are the worst part of the hotel they completely ignore you - i liked all that i tried but you have a fight on your hands trying to get bookings ( you cannot alter bookings or get any cancellations until 9am that day ) at 9 01 the sign goes up saying all restaraunts fully booked buffet food terrible really bad , the cooking stations in there are quite good but the queues as for the service in here it is terrible you have to search for plates , as for knives , forks , etc you have to take them from a table they are setting because you ask for them but they never bring them to you also you can sometimes finish your meal before they bring you a drink , bar service , there are a few barstaff that are okay but they do prefer to serve spanish speaking clients even though they know you have been waiting patiently for 15min a lot of the bar queues would be helped if they had soft drink dispensers around the bars so that you could help yourselves one tip on the buffet at lunch time give it a miss as the tex mex turns into an afternoon restaraunt without booking , you sometimes have to queue but it is well worth it , ps no wet clothes which i agree with overall lovely pool , beach a few good staff , rooms clean and okay you are not in there that long but the buffet food terrible and service except for a few terrible 
not my first choice we returned from the barcelo punta cana on the 17th june 2008 after going there for my nephews wedding there was 30 people in our party and i was quite excited as i havent travelled to the caribbean before but was recommended by my brother in law who has been 5 times but not to this resort to say the least i was quite disappointed the room wasnt up to scratch the maid used to try and get in your room at 8 10am every morning and then it was only usually cleaned at 5 30pm onwards when you were waiting to shower to go out the evening entertainment was practically non existant the entertainment was in the theatre bar which was absolutely stifling and you had a job to keep your eyes open when the show finished approx 10,30pm that was it then you had to go to the two bars which to be honest the service was atrocious not the staffs fault at one point there was one person serving with about 20 at the bar it was ridiculous on a positive note the beach area and daytime entertainment around the pool was superb i enjoyed the monster truck and seona island apart from the travelling involved i would probably go to the dominican republic again but not for a very long time and definitely not to the barcelo punta cana 
gorgeous beach , bad cocktails , and awful customer service i stayed at the barcel? premium punta cana last year in august i did not write a review then because i did not have a trip advisor account and was too upset to get more frustrated writing a review i grew up in dominican republic and have visited several resorts in punta cana , puerto plata , la romana , and samana i have been to sandals properties in jamaica and have traveled to europe ( italy , france , portugal , spain , the netherlands , and switzerland ) , egypt , kuwait , puerto rico , and panama here is a summary of my stay : - the beach is gorgeous it is windy and can have strong waves , which is fine with me the pool is big with a swim up bar customer service is inexistent we arrived after check in time but waited over an hour to get room keys because the room was not ready when we finally received the keys , the room was disgusting the beds were unmade and used towels and empty bottles of soda were on the floor i recorded the room?? conditions and took pictures and went to the front desk to complain after my persistent complaining of how unacceptable the room was , i finally got someone from the front desk to give me a clean room the cleaned room was ok the cocktails are lame they are enough to get you drunk but they are low quality they use very cheap liquor and mixers when you ask for something with ??range juice , ? you get a juice called tampico that resembles ??ang there was something that looked like vomit on one of the paths leading to the gardens i fell down and luckily did not hit my head because i used my elbows an employee saw me falling and started laughing i told him that i could have been hurt and that he should get someone to clean it up we waited over 15 minutes and no one showed up to clean up the spill the food was very good at the seafood restaurant however , the buffet and other restaurants were less than average with the dessert as the best course - the night shows are entertaining and overall the resort is beautiful despite the bad customer service and awful drinks , the price i paid was very good because i found a 10% off on the hotel?? website bottom line , this is good value for young people and families looking for a nice vacation at an affordable price but do not choose this hotel for your honeymoon or special occasion because you might be disappointed 
this place is a dump i took me 4 months to write this review because thats how long it took to cool off this was the worst experience i have ever had with a vacation in my whole enitre life check - in was terrible , we waited over an hour to get our rooms and when we did we found out that the only reason they had given us the rooms was because some other group had requested to be changed there was a huge flood in front of our rooms inside one of rooms the toilet had overflowed instead of immediately honoring our request to change rooms they asked us if they could try and clean up and fix things first since they were overbooked and had no rooms left well with a family of 5 in tow what other choice did we have ( during winter break ) the toliet in my kids room didnt work for 3 days the hotel is noisy and it stinks of fried food whenever they were preparing for meals the service is horrible , i have never waited for a bartender to serve himself before he served a guest since the old days of the iron curtain the food was not fit to be consumed by human beings the poolside entertainment was lame at best there was no real nightly entertainment to speak of the shows were a joke and even the new years celebration was the worst i have ever attended the casino was deserted and talk was that there had been some cheating by the house going on this place was an absolute nightmare so bad that i wrote to the ceo of the holding company to let him know what i thought needless to say , unlike any other time i had written a c suite exec about a problem and recieved a reply , usually at least an apology , i got nothing from them well all i can say is i will go back only if he#@ freezes over 
not worth the money i just returned from a 1 week stay at the barcel punta cana , with my husband , sister and her boyfriend we are between the ages of 22 - 33 i would like to start off by saying that this is my 3rd time in punta cana and the only time i was ever disapointed if you plan to go on holidays and enjoy some good food and rest , do not go to the barcelo food : the food here is horrible there is hardly a variety , the same stuff every day , undercooked meat , brown salad which taste funny , soups taste off terrible , just terrible my husband is not a picky eater at all , and even he struggled to find anything to enjoy we lived off of hotdogs ( which were orange in the middle and odd tasting ) , frechfries , and bland tasting pasta rooms : we booked the ocean view delux , and were told that our rooms would be in the new building , upgraded rooms , jacuzi tub , seperate stand in shower , ect long story short we did not get these rooms the rooms we ended up in are ugly , run down and in some desperate need of upgrading and a paint job we complained to the front desk and they stated that we never paid for the nicer upgraded rooms , which surely we did , we complained to the manager whom was completely rude to us , very dismissive and simply told us - nope , you did not pay for the upgraded rooms , you are not getting the upgraded rooms it was very frustrating on our last day there i found a cockroach in our room then the next morning i noticed that a bunch of rooms had signs/notices up on their doors stating that they were going to be fumigated by the pest control these rooms are not sound proof at all you can hear every single sound comming from the hallway , other people balconies , the pool , the pool bar since we were overlooking the pool and pool bar , we were kept up every single night by people partying at the pool bar until almost 6am most days i am totally cool with people partying on their vacation , but the way the resort is set up , the noise really travels and becomes quite loud at night if you are looking for a more quiet time , i would recomend you request a room not facing the poor/ocean side service : service at the barceo is very very slow if you plan on having a drink with your meal , you are better off getting it from the lobby bar yourself , rather then ask a server to bring one for you - because you will never recieve it so many times we would ask for a drink , and the server would simpy not bring it - and so we would have to get up in the middle of our meal , go to the lobby and get our own drink we found the staff and servers here to be very rude and ignorant no one ever said hola or even smiled anytime you asked for something you almost felt bad because they made it very clear that they did not want to do anything for you we even had eyes rolled at us a few times one server was cleaning our table while we had drinks in the lobby , and she wipped the pile of ashes from the ashtray all over my friends khakki pants - she looked right at him , then walked away - how rude possitives : the resort itself is very nice and cleanthere is two beauitful pools and a swim up bar which was not usually too busy the beach is beauitful , with perfect white sand , blue ocean , clean and has plenty of chairs , but very limited spots for shade - same goes for the pool - not much shade you have to get down very early to reserve your spot the main pool is quite loud with music and activities , but the 2nd , newer pool is much more quiet we enjoyed both pools you are at the end of a line up of other resorts , and it is pretty eatay to take a walk down the beach and sneak into them to check things out we did not see any weddings at this resort , and do not really see where they would do them they do not have a wedding gazebo or anything like that overall , i would rate our stay a 1 5 or 2 out of 5i would never never go back - not even for free - the food was just way too bad and i could not stand the rudeness from the staff if you want a good vacation , spend a little bit more and go to the bahia principe in punta cana - i went there last year for my wedding and what an amazing resort i have also stayed at the riu taino in punta cana , and that also was an great resort it really is a shame because the grounds are very nice - but bad service and food really ruined it for us 
would not go there again i have gone through the other reviews on this hotel and i must admit i am a bit surprised that so many people have rated this hotel favourably it could be that i was extremely unlucky? my experience there was not quite as positive? here are the facts? what we liked : the beach is fantasticthe swimming pools are huge and great what we did not like : the service : it is extremely slow , slower than you can imagine we queued 1 hour to check in and 45 minutes to check out service at the restaurants is also very slow things are better at bars ? our room : nothing was working in our room , starting from the lights , to the toilet , to the shower , just to mention a few we had a leaking ceiling in the bathroom using the bathroom was basically a nightmare looks like some rooms at the hotel have been refurbished and some have not? those who describe their rooms as really nice must have stayed at the refurbished rooms we did ask if we could change rooms , but were told the hotel was fully booked in 10 days , we only had our towels changed once we were without towels for 4 days ( luckily , i had brought 2 when we asked the maid , she said they were washing them and she would bring them? the restaurants : we were booked at 3 a la carte restaurants , which sounded really good but they booked us at 9 30 pm every time and we could never make it ( we have a 5 year old child ) we asked if we could change time , but they told us no the food at the buffet was not very good it was kept there for a long time , was greasy and overcooked i once found an insect in the soup? these things happen , but it was not that pleasanthotel facilities : we chose this hotel because it had a great water park for kids? shame that it was closed when we were there on the hotel website it did not say anything about it being closed? our child was really upset about that the spa was also under construction ( or refurb , not sure ) the gym was closed 2 days i was disappointed by the standards of the hotel and by the way problems were dealt by hotel staff 
if you are trying to break up with someone then take your bf/gf to the barcelo resort in punta cana needless to say , our visit was awful so awful that i could not shake a feeling that my bf wanted to break up and , break up we did - - - -2 weeks later 
nice hotel , but bad service we travelled to barcelo , punta cana the hotel itself is very nice , decent rooms , beatiful pools and landscape the beach is excellent , water sports are great and can be booked very easily the only negative thing is how slow and unfriedly the service is in this hotel nobody knows anything when asked , in the morning before going to trip we had to come for an early breakfast - personnel was sleeping by the palm trees they are not willing to help - forget about asking in english , when we tried to ask in spanish they did not even try to understand they just do not want to work 
definitely a 3* experience we stayed at bpc from feb 10- feb 17 in a premium club room we were told before we arrived that we would be in a suite , but when we got there , we were in a standard , but renovated room in block 3 overlooking the main pool we were ok with that because we heard that the suites were not as nice as the renovated rooms the renovations were definitely nice unfortunately , our air conditioning unit never actually threw out cold air , and despite numerous requests , they never fixed it it must have been a problem for the people before us as well , since the maintenance people were installing a new thermostat when we walked in with our luggage maid service was terrible - - the maid would hang up clearly dirty towels again instead of leaving fresh ones and we were left without towels at all for two days - - we made about 5 calls asking for towels the second day and finally got some an hour and a half later there were also two days when the maid did not bother to come to our room at all our fridge was always filled with drinks , so that was good we ate at all 7 of the a la cartes for dinner , and they were all fine - - service was great at the tokio restaurant we did not care for the food at mirador i ordered a ny strip steak ( for which they charge you an extra $10) and it was inedible the steaks at the other restaurants ( without the extra charge ) were much better the people in the premium club lounge were nice and were very helpful with dinner reservations , which allowed us to avoid the front desk both pools were nice , although the music at the main pool was a little irritating when you were trying to sleep in a bit - - it started at 9 am the alcoholic beverages were ok and we never had any problems with service - - margaritas were generally excellent - - but be prepared if you are a cosmopolitan fan - - they do not have cranberry juice the only concern is that they do not seem to wash the bar glasses very carefully - - - we watched them basically just rinse them off most of the time and then re - use them we went to the new spa and my husband and i each had a massage , and we both agreed that the massages were the worst we ever had my feet were actually aching after the foot massage part the new theater was definitely nice , but i agree with other posters about amateur quality our second night there , they asked to come up on stage for what we thought would be a short game the show was supposed to be dance around the world it turns out that the entire show was us and 3 other couples taking turns dancing the waltz , swing , tango , lambada and merengue we got a bottle of rum out of it , but i ca not believe it was that much fun for the audience the rest of the shows were mostly lipsyncs with pretty bad dancing - - the lead male dancer was very good , though , and the gentleman that came in and did two songs as michael jackson was also good overall , i would not go back - - the all inclusives we stayed at in jamaica and cancun were just better run and more fun , especially for an american couple in their mid 30s 
still undergoing renovations/upgrades my boyfriend and i are from the states , in our 40's we have no children and enjoy pool/beach time as well as cocktailing and beach walking we have mixed reviews the first thing to know is that there was a lot of renovation work going on barcelo bought the hotel from breezes and the company seems to be working hard to upgrade everything unfortunately , it made for an unpleasant stay at times for us my boyfriend and i went for a week we paid for a sea view room when we got to our room it was recently renovated and very nice , clean , comfortable beds even a brand new coffee maker , mini - refrigerator etc however , by that night we realized it would be hard to get rest we were on the 2nd floor the space/rooms below us were gutted and there were workers moving cement with wheelbarrows and pounding until 9 p the next day we complained and tried to get another room the problem was there were many people trying to move to different rooms our complaint of construction noise paled compared to what we heard from others some said their rooms ( in a different side than ours and on low floors ) smelled like mold or mildew one woman said she was sleeping on 2 boxsprings instead of a matress and boxspring another couple had a leaky ceiling hot water was also a compliant some made by the 2nd day we did get moved up 1 floor however we had to make due with 2 beds instead of 1 king at least it got us up away from the construction noise more and the view of the ocean improved the key to getting a room cahnge is persistance and either kindness or loudness it depends on who you talk to it also seems the premium ocean view rooms and suites up high on floor 5 or so are the best bet the other disadvantage of you get a room near the casion the voices of people will wake you up in the wee hours as they leave the casino renovation work was also being done on the grounds near the rock climbing wall and it was closed the week we were there we found the front desk service so slow and they are not very attentive it seems each week they play a game of moving people around to make as many people happy as possible we realize most people do not use a gym on this kind of vacation but we like to work out and the gym equipment is very old , rusty , broken and hardly worth using only 4 cardio bikes and no treadmills it was pretty pathetic the postives -  the beaches were absolutely gorgeous as well as the very large pool there was never a shortage of lounge chairs at the beach or the pool there are also plenty of poolside activities like yoga/stretching , spanish lessons , water aerobics , etc we found a nice mix of  we enjoyed the large selection of food at the buffets and the service at the bars was always quick we also really enjoyed some of the specialty restaruants like paris - the french restaruant and the japanese restaurant however , we went to roma , the italian restaurant and were seated 30 minuted after our reservation time and still sat another 20 minutes before we just walked out not sure if that was a fluke with something that night or not we enjoyed a couple 's massage with oils at the spa it was very nice bu the spa is very small - it just takes up a coupld of normal size guest room spaces on the 1st floor we booked a couple of excursions on site through our worry free vacation representative names mr he was awesome he was expecially helpful in tracking down our luggage ( we had a tight connection and our 1st flight was late - we made it on board but our luggage did not ) we got it 2 days later thanks to mr we enjoyed the 2 boat excursions , one was a half day on the ron tiki - very fun , snorkeling , etc the other was a ful day (2 5 hours drive time each way ) they take you out to an island on a catamaran and bring you back on motor boat be sure to take toilet paper if they stop at a community bathroom for you to use there is no toilet paper to anywhere this resort is also down on one end from the main strip and the other resorts this can be a pro or con depending on what you are looking to do we did not do any of the shows so i cannot comment on those my final comments are that front desk service leaves a lot to be desired but the bartenders are great and usually fast i believe this will be a beautiful place when it is completely renovated but in the meantime it is hard to endure some of the construction noise , etc right now , you truly get what you pay for when it comes to rooms there is quite a difference in quality depending on if the room has been renovated yet , etc 
amazing beach my boyfriend and i are in our 20's and overall we had a good trip a few problems here and there but nothing extreme to start if you see that you are booking your trip with the prestige class this means abosolutly nothing it stated that with this prestige class we would get a separate check in 00 to the casino which we did however they do not tell you , you have to spend $20 to get the $20 free , and separate swimming area which we never saw either rooms - after reading these bad reviews about the rooms and having heard many complaints well at the resort my boyfriend an i were very shocked we stayed in building 7 on the top floor and it was great very clean , the tall ceilings , and the maids did a great job everyday only downfall was the first couple of days we had trouble getting hot water and at one point we had to wait about 10 minutes for any water at all food - we had a lot of trouble with the food it could of just been our stomach 's but we talked to many others on the resort and they had the same bad feelings towards it there is lots of variety i would advise all to say away from the marlin steak and seafood a la carte it was horrible we enjoyed the mexican as well as the italian also we could only get reservations for 9:30 pm which is much to late for dinner so we went at 7 every time and they let us in early with no problems there is nothing bad to say about it any disappointments we had with the hotel were forgotten about because of the awesome beach we spent everyday by the ocean used the pool once or twice the pools are very clean we used the newly opened pool as it seemed to be less busy we soon realized if you want a hut on the beach for shade they were always taken by 8:30 but there was more then enough lounge chairs service - the service was pretty bad however this could have been because we choose to go the busiest time of year dec 30- jan 6 staff would come around at meal time and ask what you would like to drink half the time i would not know if she even understood me because we would never get it or we would just get them ourselves as we could not wait any longer we went to the buffet one night and there was not a clean table in sight we had to sit at a used table that had no cutlery/glasses until we got them ourselves we had a problem with the towel hut as there were none cleaned and this was at 9:00 am after going back about 45 min later we received them and just kept those towel for the rest of the week and dried it on our balcony i found the language barrier was so frustrating at reception i would have thought that at least one of the workers could of spoke english a little but no this was definitely not the case excursions - we did the reef explorer and it was the highlight of our trip you take a boat ride out to a floating dock and get the chance to snorkel , swim with the sting rays and nurse sharks we got to hold the sting rays however it is very difficult as well they provide you with sandwiches , smoothies , veggies , and cookies we got massages at no extra cost and there was also kayaks and lots of lounge chairs if you chose to relax this is well worth the $83 00/per personwe would not go back to this resort just because there are too many others to seek out 
not good , not bad , but definately not a 4 star i 'm one of those travellers that visits trip advisor to review a resort before i book i do agree that you ca not always judge based on bad reviews , however , i now understand why this resort gets mixed reviews when i booked this resort , i asked the travel agent about the bad reviews and they assured me that airtransat holidays rates this resort a 4 star since i have travelled and stayed in mexico , cuba , and costa rica resorts ( some rated at a 3 5 star and some at a 4 star ) i can confidently say that this resort is definately not a 4 star we got a fairly decent price for a two - week stay from dec 6 to dec 20th under the so - called prestige class do not let this marketing scam fool you prestige class is a scam to attract more people to the resort you do not get any perks that is advertised the resort looks very nice from the outside the pool is amazing ( lagoon style ) and the beach is breathtaking i do agree that the beach area at this resort was the nicest areas of the beach as it was always clean ( compared to the other resorts ) the entertainment was amazing the service was somewhat good except for the front desk we always tipped at the restaraunts and bar so i 'm sure that helped the greenery and landscaping is also very nice and well kept now for the bad the first room they gave us was horrible it smelled really bad , the closet door was broken and off its hinges , the balcony door was broken , the bathroom ceiling leaked , the soap dish rusted off and rust appeared throughout the bathroom we decided that the room was not going to affect our vacation since we would only be sleeping in it , until we found two cockroaches one in the bathroom and one in our bed i developed a skin rash on my legs and soon discovered that it was from bed bugs needless to say , i was upset i complained as calmly as i could at the front desk and showed them the rash on my legs finally , we sparked their attention and they moved us into a better room with a rubber seal below the door ( this stops bugs from getting into the room ) the room still smelled bad but as long as there was not any bugs in my bed i was fine the housekeepers were great they washed the floors daily and did a good job trying to keep the room clean the food at the buffet is horrible and , as mentioned in other reviews , was never covered from flies or birds the bread is covered in baskets so i mostly ate bread or pasta at the pasta bar , since it was cooked in front of you the tokio restaraunt was really good and the other a la carte restaraunts were just okay i got food poisioning from the paris restaraunt , which i validated when 2 other people that ate there the same night also got food poisioning this resort is falling apart as we stood outside of the resort ( close to the photo shop ) a bunch of slate shingles slid off the roof and landed a few feet away from us another person we met got zapped by the light switch in the bathroom because it was hanging by wires the hazard that concerned me the most was the water leaking through the ceiling in many different places in the common areas and the ceiling was falling apart we also found out that one of the chandaliers and part of the ceiling came down on an older man sitting in the common area this resort has the potential of being a 4 star but at its current state i would give it , at best , a 3 star and mostly because of the pool , beach , entertainment , and some of the staff we have not been feeling well since we left this resort and i 've come to the conclusion that it was from the food overall , i will visit punta cana again someday but would rather pay the extra to feel safe and comfortable in the end , since we met a lot of fabulous people , enjoyed the fab pool and beach , i still enjoyed my vacation a few travelling tips : bring lots of single us dollar bills for tipping and no large bills bring toys , school supplies , and candy for the kids when you go on your excursions you can throw them to the kids when driving though the villages bring toys and school supplies for the maids the maids especially like things like shampoo , conditioner , etc the vendors are very agressive so be agressive back if you want buy something never pay what they ask and take about 30-50% of their asking price you 'll get tired of them saying for you try to speak as much spanish as you can even if you just smile and say hola , amigo or hola , amiga they appreciate it by smiling back : ) 
not 4 star the resort itself was okay some things you should know before you book this resort some ants in the room , food is fair , the worst casino i 've ever seen , sports bar a joke , only 2 decent restaurants and unless you book at 8:30 am you ca not get in , drinks only fair , few staff speak english , little entertainment in spite of all this , my family had a good time as long as you expect little more than beautiful beach and pool , you 'll do okay 
not bad/great beach my husband and our friends stayed at the barcelo from 11/12 thru 11/19 if you 're looking for the ritz do not go , but neither is it a flea bag hotel i cannot stress this enough remember where you are you are in a country where the people work at a slower pace and do not have the same standards as we do check in went smoothly we arrived at the hotel around 2pm there was not a line and they greeted us with drinks ( great drink , i never did find out what it was and when we asked for it at the bar they looked at us like they did not know what we were talking about ) our rooms were not ready ( we were told on the way to the hotel that check in was 3pm and it was likely that our rooms would not be ready so we went to the buffett and had lunch and walked around for a bit right around 3pm we went back to check on our rooms the front desk made a few calls and we finally got our keys our rooms were adequate and clean we were in building 7 again , if you expect the ritz you will be disappointed we had a king bed which i thought was pretty comfortable my husband woke up with a sore back every morning we had a nice garden view from our balcony and we had coffee on the balcony every morning our room was situated at the end of the building closest to the pool the shows are at the pool every night they did get loud it did not bother us that much as we were not in bed very early we were out on our balcony one night and it was a little annoying they stock the mini fridge everyday although they only put in 2 bottled waters we stopped at the bar everynight and got a couple extra bottles to make coffee with in the morning we did not have any trouble with the hot water although there were at least 3 times when i was showering that the water pressure dropped to the point that there was not any water coming out of the shower head i turned the faucet off and turned it back on after about 30 sec to 1 min and it was fine i do not know why it happened , but it did the food was good we ate at the mexican , italian , french , japanese and the buffett i liked the mexican restaurant the best i thought the french was the worst the food was not bad there , i guess it was not what i was expecting we only ate at the buffett twice for dinner i think it would get old after awhile the times we ate there they had a pretty big selection the buffett was best in the morning the guy making the omlettes was great best omelettes i have had in a long time if you 're looking for a big selection on a buffett the restaurant by the pool is not the place to go of course they do not have the room to lay out a big spread like in the hotel oh and do not leave your food unattended at the pool buffett a few times people filled their plates and put them on the table and left the table only to come back and find that a bird had been their eating the food the cocktails are wonderful they do not scrimp on the alcohol the banana mama 's are great the blue lagoon 's are not bad either the beach is great we did not have any problem getting a little hut on the beach everyday we went down around 9 - 9:30am every morning and there were usually plenty available watch the waves they can be pretty rough the staff was great the front desk spoke pretty good english as did most of the wait staff and bar staff we did have a communication problem with one of our waiters and a bartender but for the most part if they do not understand what you are trying to say they will call someone over who speaks a little more english it was fun trying to communicate with what spanish that i knew and for the most part the staff tries to teach you and help you if they see you are trying now to the complaints our friends seemed to have the most problems so i 'll relay what i know our friends went to their room one afternoon and their card key did not work they went to the front desk and the person at the desk reprogrammed their card after dinner that night they went back to their room their card key did not work they went back to the front desk and again the card was reprogrammed the next day i went to use my card key and it did not work i went to the front desk and they reprogrammed my card it was a minor but irritating incovenience our friends called down to the front desk our first day there and asked for two extra pillows the front desk said they would take care of it after 2 days our friends saw their maid in the hall and somehow communicated to her ( she spoke very little english ) that they needed 2 extra pillows the vendors are annoying i think the hotel lets them set up every other night the first night was fine you walked through the lobby and they were very persistent that you look at their things we looked at some and walked by others the second and third times that they were there we started looking for ways to go around them 
great place - just stay away from the casino my boyfriend and i just returned from our trip to punta cana , where we stayed at the barcelo premium overall , we had a great experience and a wonderful time before i lose any of you , please please please do yourselves a favor and do not even go near this resorts casino there is something very strange that goes on down there , and after speaking with many guests , everyone felt like there was something very strange and fishy with the casino and people who work there we lost over a thousand dollars in a dumb game within a few minutes another couple lost three thousand in a few minutes almost everyone we spoke to lost a lot of money and had something to complain about with the casino so stay far far away , very shady besides that , the check - in took us over an hour and half they are very unorganized and they did not have any rooms cleaned so bring an extra bag of patience because you will need it our room was not ready and we ended up getting very very frustrated , to the point where we had to speak to the manager also , there is a lot of construction going on at the hotel , so be prepared to hear a lot of drilling and noise from early morning to evening time i would request a room far from the construction area if possible but honestly - we had a blast and such a great time regardless we met many many nice people , including a lot of dominicans working at the hotel the pool and beach are awesome the food is fab and there is always something to eat the drinks , especially banana mamas are great bring dollar bills and tip the bartenders , they will hook you up and give you special attention also , i would recommend bringing something little for the dominican children especially if you are planning on doing an excursion or going out into the town something as simple as pencils and sharpeners , or crayons and coloring books the children will run after you asking you for money , etc , and i found it nice that i had little gifts for all of them something as simple and little as a pencil made them smile , so it is well worth it you will have a great time get involved w/ the entertainment staff and get to know the workers they made our trip wonderful just stay far away from the casino - or you 'll regret it 
what a dump the hotel looked great on the website and the amenities sounded great , but the hotel is a total disaster i say stay away from this resort : if you like your room cleaned before 3pm if you like to use wash clothsif you do not like roaches in the bathroomsif you like hot waterif you like good foodif you do not like to have salad left out for hoursif you like clean dishesif you like clean towelsif you like top shelf liquorif you like to sleep and not hear the people in the other room if you like to see the ocean view in your ocean view room ( not the trees ) yeah the price was good , but i can think of a lot of other places for the price 
nice place for the price aside from being shocked by the air conditioner controls while not wearing shoes , the room was nice , and cleaned daily the floors are tile so if you do not have the air conditioning pumped the floor will be wet and slippery dr is very humid so a lot of things are wet there unless air conditioned which would somewhat explain getting shocked by the air conditioning controls all the rooms have a balcony which is nice , ours overlooked the pool which was huge and beautiful with a pool bar in the middle which was a lot of fun in the afternoon we met a lot of nice people there the room we had also had an ocean view which was nice , we could see the waves breaking way out from shore in the sea the beach at this hotel is gorgeous , one of the best i have seen within walking distance of the hotel we walked down the beach a ways past other hotels that were more expensive but their beach did not compare to ours the waves were nice if you like to boogie board i beleive there are other hotels further down in the bay area that hardly have any waves on the beach so it depends on your preference we had a really nice time at this hotel it was not 5 stars but for the price you cannot beat this hotel for all inclusive especically if you love the beach and pool scene bring a raft and big insulated cups for them to make drinks for you in the cups they give you are about 6oz cups for drinks and beers bring snacks too , you will get sick of the food after a while and if you want a bag of chips get ready to spend $10, no joke about $50 if you want to buy a raft there also bring lots of small bills they hold on to the american dollar like it is gold there you will have a hard time getting change , only in pesos bring lots of singles and fives and tens also having exact change for everything is key , they will always tell you they ca not give you change so that you will tell them to just keep it , seems to be the theme of the island 
teppanyaki cock roach racing mick  beach location , fantastic pool , superb if you want to lose weight , eat the food ,4days on the toilet if you like good entertainment , go to the teppanyaki restaurant , while our food was being prepared , 2 cockroaches appeared and raced aroundthe edge of the hot plate which were then squashed by the chefs foot rooms clean but smelly and very damp , staff very friendly apart from beach bar 
may be cheap and 4 star - not worth it my husband and i went to this resort for our honeymoon we stayed for 2 weeks they have a very nice pool and great beach the beach is very large , but they did not provide enough lawn chairs and also never had enough towels we have never travelled anywhere before and we thought it would be better to go to a less expensive resort for 2 weeks , we were wrong by the time the 2 weeks was over we were dying to go home they do not provide enough included activities to keep you busy the entertainment was dull - the man by the pool everyday was just annoying they blast the same song every morning and it wakes you up they literally play the same 3 songs for 4 hours a day every day , i am not exageratting the food was absouloutly terrible there was lots of selection but it was boring , tasteless , and made your stomach hurt i found some of the people nice , but most just ignore you the merchants they allow in every other day are the most uncomfortable experience the hound you and lie to you to try to get you to buy things from them never pay full price for anything , not even half , they amount they ask you for is just insane the towel situation is ridiculas , never a clean towel - ever the maid only changed our bedding once , it gets very damp there so the sheets and blankets stink also the atm was never working make sure you bring your own american money as most places only accept american anyways no need for pecos you would have to get up at 6 am just to get some money they also will rip you off anyway they can , watch your change this is definatly not a four star resort , im not sure how they rate resorts but they are way off with this one this is in my opinion a 2 or 3 star you may think your getting a deal like us but your not this year we will try sandals tubing was fun , so was horseback riding and scuba diving , but in my opinion these activities were very overpriced please dont choose this resort i am not a negative person , it takes a lot to dissatisfy me i went with the expectations of a four star resort i am so dissapointed because this was my honeymoon next time i will not cheap out 
hotel from hell we arrived at the barcelo punta cana and began to get excited because the hotel was very pristine on the exterior however the nightmare began on check - in we did not get a room key for five hours , even though we were told to return to the desk at 30 minute intervals we tried to make the best of the situation by having lunch at the buffet restaurant , where we discovered that the food was not good quality , and by trying to get beach towels for the entire 5 hours finally , we received our key when we entered the room , which was in building 7 on the 3rd floor , we were greeted by this horrendous smell of mold and mustiness i immediately called down to the front desk to advise them and was told that housekeeping would be there momentarily to address the problem well needless to say that the smell remained the entire time of our stay , despite the constant air freshener smell that housekeeping tried to mask it with also , the room was very shoddy and mold was evident under the bedroom mats and around the ceiling and tile grout service was terrible when you were able to find someone that spoke english , everything under the sun was promised , but nothing was ever delivered not a working tv , not the correct amount of towels , not a cleaner , fresh smelling room , not daily beach towels , not fruit that was not covered with flies , and not poor quality food that was not laden with loads of salt nothing was delivered and even though i complained to 5 managers and got five excuses and promises to address my complaints , i received nothing so , if you enjoy vacationing at a hotel from hell , then by all means barcelo punta cana is the place for you by the way , we tried to change hotels , but after being told by our vacation rep , who had an office at the hotel , that the request had to be submitted , reviewed , and authorized over a period of four to five days , we had no choice but to stay 
not as nice as it could be hi all , my husband and i stayed at the barcelo punta cana from the 17 of july to the 1 august i had read up alot about this hotel on the trip adviser and it was our first time in the dom rep so we was not sure what to exspect obviosly because everyone is different in what they like and exspect , it was our hoonymoon and we took our 4 year old daughter with us so anyway the check in took about half hour but we did have a problem with rooms we were told to stay at the reception for half hour till it was fixed , we waited , then a hotel porter took us to our room where he opened the door to a man taking his trousers off , ( wrong room ) so then he took us upstairs to another room which had somone staying in it but fortunatly this time they were out so then we were told to wait in the hallway again , finally half an hour later we were taken to our room the room was ok but the balcony had some rails missing , so there was quite a big gap , ( watch out kids ) there was some rust on the mirrors , the sliding doors got jammed , the toilet was broke , the draws got stuck , the sheets were a little damp the t v ariel broke the last 2 days but so was everyone elses and the aircon leaked just a little in the bathroom , but i could cope with all that as we wasnt going to be in our rooms hopfully that much , id hoped anyway we tiped the maid 2 dollers everyday because she was nice and always fussed our daughter but about 6 times she came after 5 30 and we were in our rooms by then and i dont want to sound fussy saying it but i didnt like coming back at that time and the rooms not being done the buffy food was ok and the resterants were good ( roma my favorate ) but we did have trouble getting in as they were booked up by 9 15 in the morning , so get there early the one restarant i didnt like was el marin , they do a lunch buffy everyday next to the beach and there are alot of flys and birds landing on tables and food and i saw a bird poo on the restarant floor which put me off my meal , we also all got the runs for about 8 of the days we were there and my husband got sick for 2 days the shows was the usual stuff in a all inclusive some you like some you dont they all started about 9 30 but to be fair we didnt watch them all as our daughter got tired , they did have a mini disco that lasted about 3 songs but i think this was because people didnt bring there kids to it for some reason so i think they ended it early which my little girl wasnt happy about some of the waiters was nice but alot just snarled at you and gave us the wrong drinks all the time and i also found that if you dont tip you get served last if that , so i was eager to tip just to get served but my husband refused because they were so rude a lot of times i was in the buffy que and the spanish ( well looked spanish anyway ) women just pushed straight in , which when you have been queing got my goat a little to be fair the beach was brill and the pool was nice but too many stupid little things let down what was once i imagine was a nice hotel but would i go again , no , i would have liked the little touches like the flower art in my room because it was our hoonymoon but we didnt get any of that and we didnt get the free room upgrade or drinks on arrival which i thought we would , so overall i wasnt that impressed but its like i said , people exspect differant things and for the money we could have had a better holiday at another resort like the riu just down the beach we had a look and that and that had the wow factor thanks for your time we hope our information is of some use to you , have a good holiday 
not as bad as others are saying just roll with it single lady alone you take the good , you take the bad and you realize that , hey you 're on vacation not everything is going to be perfect check in was not perfect , eh and if you 're at the front of the line , you 're on your way to your room in 5 minutes , but if you 're at the back of the line , you 'll have to be patient and wait longer i waited about 15 to 20 minutes i decided to be a paranoid and an independant little snot and carry my own single duffle bag and so i got lost trying to find my room i recommend you allow the bellhop to carry your bag and lead you to your room i got lost and walked around in circles but it was my own damn fault it 's a big resort seven buildings and over 700 rooms so can we all expect quick and personal attention all the time plus , when i got to my room , finally , i looked into the little envelope the front guest gave me and there was no room keycard so i had to go all the way back to the front desk and get another one again , my own damn fault , i should have checked that i had it the food was okay being really paranoid about my health , i did not eat any vegetables or salads i just ate carbs and meat but i was full and satisfied there 's more than enough food two buffets for breakfast and dinner and then five speciality restaurants ( tip : go the the front desk there 's a sign on the desk go in the morning between 9am and 4pm to book a speciality restaurant the day of when you want to eat there ( the italin one fills up the fastest the beef is very tough but the dairy products are heaven the butter , yogurt , and cheese i do not know what they feed their cows here but their milk must be wonderful i was not sick from the food at all i just felt sick when i got home from the re - circulated air on the four hour plane ride day activities are corny and simple by the pool but the mc is cute and funny look out for spagetti a very talk and thin dominican staff guy he 's very outgoing and very funny relax and have some fun evening shows at the theatre are a must they are equally funny and corny but a good laugh the dancers are not from broadway but they 're good enough to entertain they try to lip synch to english songs rather poorly , they speak spanish after all , but at least they 're trying beach is lovely watch out for jets flying insects that look like wasps it was 30 degrees celcius everyday and only rained at night use waterproof sunblock i ca not stress that enough i burned my legs to the point of blisters the room was adequate enough i left tips ( t to ensure promptness ) and my room was always clean by 1 or 2 in the afternoon unless you 've got a wad of cash burning a hole in your pocket stay away from the art vendors their prices are outrageous even if you bargain they offered me a necklace for $80 us they are extremely aggressive and annoying you can not use a calling card because the resort does not allow any toll - free numbers to be called out you can call long distance from your room , but it 's $2 us a minute ( pay at check out ) there 's a bank and an atm but if you have a td canada trust card , you 're out of luck it does not work in the machine after 3 failed attempts the machine will take your card i suggest cash us dollars or dominican pesos ( you can exchange at the front desk ) your on - site travel agency resort representative will have smaller bills to make tips if there 's one bad thing i can really say it 's that i was travelling alone as a single woman in her 30's and some of the male staff members were sexually agressive i lost count but i 'd say in the seven days i was there i was hit on by at least 20 men but you can take advantage of it ladies we get away with murder here you can get men to do anything for you 
poor service we stayed at this hotel from 2nd april to 16 april 2007 potentialy this could be a very good hotel , it was our fourth visit to dom rep and the service at this hotel was probably the worst we have had anywhere in the world service in all the resteraunts is slow and unwelcoming the rooms are shabby and not very clean the food is hot and plenty of choice , el sombrero serves food 24 hrs but we found that the chef was drunk every night from approx 1 30am so choice was limited in my opinion it is not worth the extra cost to upgrade to club premium although the staff at club premium lounge are the best at this hotel ( rosa  bella ) they are fantastic and cant do enough for you shame the rest of the staff are not the same do not bother contacting barcelo headoffice they will not reply to your correspondance a tip for anyone going there if you are lucky enough to be served at any of the lobby bars double up on your drinks barcelo need to get a grip on this hotel as i said it could be excellent good pool  beach excellent entertainment as far as dom rep goes fun buggy tour well worth going on , but you can only book this on the internet monster truck safari dont bother better trips than this and less expensive 
the whole truth stayed @ this property and did find it to be extremely aged , ( it was bought by the barcelo from breezes some time ago had terrible food , and the rooms were not nice at all if these things are important to you , then this resort is not for you the food was a huge disappointment , the matresses were very poor , the housekeeping service was sub par however , ~the dominican people are wonderful very kind  friendly the trapeze , rock - climbing wall are super the beach is nice however , we wish that we would have not gone to this property saved a little more $$ and returned to cancun again , or puerto vallarta , hualtulco or ixtapa had been to puerta plata previously and found it to be nicer because unlike this location , you are not locked in nothing nearby for fun or shopping , no public transportation etc if we would have gotten sick or in need of medical attention , it would have been disasterous many people we spoke with did enjoy the resort , but all had never been to all inclusive resorts in mexico or anywhere else really hope this helps 
mixed review ok , this is my 4th time to dr the others were : iberostar dominicana , pc , sunscape the beach , pc , and occidental puerto plata i will be comparing only to these other hotels not to my other destinations ( not fair to compare to europe , us , etc ) i also went alone on vacation this time around so had lot of time to take it all in : check in - a breeze i guess it depends on how many people come to this hotel on your flight i had no problem with customer service as others have said the opposite do not forget to ask for your free safe key room - decent nothing to complain about i 've heard nightmare stories , though i had no hot water on my last day but thats the only complaint about rooms itself it seems as they are renovated a building at a time starting with 7 and moving backward i was in 5 and it was neat and clean not as nice as iberostars and sunscape , though just being honest here room service - i 've had better at the 3 other hotels i 'm used to leaving 2 dollar tips for the maid and having a clean room with little treats on my pillow i do not really care too much you have to leave a note for the maids here telling them the tip or gift is for her beach - great lots of waves and strong current right now so be careful the water was prettier than sunscape as sunscape was on the the atlantic ocean ( but thats the only complaint about sunscape the beach ) pool - it was nice not much to comment on : ) activities - not so great it wasnt ' as exciting as fun as compared to iberostars i look forward to the staff coming and getting you to join in for dance lessons on the beach or by the pool that was lacking here food - sorry but i am not picky at all , believe me but , i did not like the quality of food the variety was so - so i missed the yummy breakfasts i 've had at others and all the fresh fruit shakes , etc i only can comment on 2 of the specialty restaurants tokyo - not bad but very salty mexican - not good drinks - lots to choose from i got absolut when i asked for it the guys serving drinks at the lobby bar 2 ( near the paris rest ) were great hard working and very attentive made me anything i wanted and tried to keep up with the swarm of people that would get annoyed waiting 3 minutes for their 100th drink of the day so , here i 'm saying the service i received was great check out - a breeze i was constantly hear people complain about the most ridiculous things in my opionion i 've gone to italy , greece , costa rice in the past so i do not feel i should compare food to those places but i think i can safely compare this to other hotels i would not come back only b/c i did not like the hotel as well as the others and i like to try different places when i come i would def not deter anyone from coming either it was not a dump as some have described but there are others a bit nicer too as far as service and the rooms in general , it was def worth the money overall , dr is an affordable trip and its the caribbean so i would not have huge expectations and just go and have fun 
i visited this hotel along with my boyfriend from 22/01/2007 until 01/02/2007 we had to cut the holiday short by 4 days due to the widespread sickness including vomiting and diarrhoea the holiday was an absolute nightmare from start to finish and i have been left deeply stressed and saddened by the whole experience on arrival at the hotel , we were advised to eat at the alcazar buffet restaurant on entering the dining room my boyfriend and i were stunned in amazement at the uncovered food and the flies swarming over each dish every tray of food was crawling with flies and insects we were truly disgusted and very unnerved about the rest of our stay we ate nothing that night other guests seemed oblivious and unconcerned by the flies and i even witnessed a lady pick three flies out of her chilli - con - carne before eating it happily another night , four of us dined at the roma italian restaurant we all ate the spaghetti carbonara and consumed no alcohol shortly after leaving the restaurant i had to return to my room due to feeling unwell i then began to suffer from diarrhoea which kept me awake all through the night upon awakening at 5am my boyfriend had diarrhoea also we met with with the couple with whom we had dined the previous evening and they too had diarrhoea and felt unwell another night , we went to the dominican restaurant ??onocu? waited 1 hour and 10 minutes for our first course i am all for trying different kinds of foods , however , unimpressed with the water , goat and banana concoction that they called ??oup? we left the restaurant and attempted to eat plain bread at the alcazar buffet , as this was the only food free of flies my boyfriend and i resorted to eating crisps and chocolate from the hotel shop for the duration of our stay as we could not bear to eat the fly infested food we visited the alcazar buffet for coffee one day and witnessed a lady vomiting over the bread counter and a bird stomping about in and eating the breakfast food we experienced numerous power cuts at the hotel every single day of our stay the power cuts disabled all the electricity and water , not ideal when suffering vomiting and diarrhoea the toilet would not flush and we could not wash our hands on waking one morning at 6am for a trip we had booked , i realised that the power was down and the water supply was off , and had to dress in complete darkness , without washing and tried to reach reception for help without tripping over or bumping into anything reception simply ignored my presence and continued to light their own candles and look after themselves , with no consideration to the numerous people who required their assistance despite informing staff that i suffer from fainting and dizzy spells when i have 'nt eaten , they offered us no assistance i asked at the alcazar buffet for fruit or bread or anything they had already prepared that we could eat before boarding our coach for the trip , but they were simply ignorant and refused to acknowledge my existence on returning to the hotel after the trip , extremely distressed with vomiting and diarrhoea , i then tried to telephone my mum in england to seek her advice i approached guest services who informed me that i had to go to reception and leave a $20 deposit to use the telephone in the lobby i waited at reception for approximately five minutes before any member of the four staff offered their assistance to me , although it was clear i was ill and very upset the reception staff could not understand that i wanted to telephone home to england and so i wrote my country down along with the full telephone number and asked the lady to ring it for me after taking my $20 deposit , she refused to dial and told me to use the telephone in the lobby i lifted the telephone in the lobby where i was connected to a spanish - speaking operator who again could not understand me by this time i thought i was going to vomit again and was in tears , clearly extremely upset and frustrated at this point , three members of the reception staff were looking and pointing at me from behind the desk and laughing the male staff member was actually holding his sides from laughing so much this made me feel isolated and alone and was a very stressful experience a fourth member of staff from the reception desk then called me over and took the piece of paper on which the telephone number was written , off me she told me to sit by the lobby telephone again after five minutes , the phone rang and i was connected to my mum in england my mum was horrified when i told her of my experiences and immediately started making plans to get us home it was clear from the outset that the only way to get assistance or to be shown the least bit of attention by the hotel staff was to tip them , despite having paid for an all - inclusive holiday often we would wait up to twenty minutes at the bar to be served a drink , and still would not get what we had asked for the language barrier is really bad in addition , we were not even offered a single cup of coffee or a glass of water at breakfast in the alcazar buffet , or with our evening meal during any of our visits there indeed , many of the staff seemed to be too preoccupied with shooing flies away from the food also , my friend and i did not feel confident in walking about the hotel grounds alone without our boyfriends , as many of the members of male staff would congregate in huge numbers and stare and cackle things at you as you walked past , quite intimidating we were not overjoyed by the state of our room which was dishevelled and clearly in need of repair the bedding was covered in cigarette burns the mirror was splashed in brown paint so much so we could hardly see ourselves in it the balcony lock was very temperamental and when checking to ensure the doors were locked , the plaster would flake away from the adjoining wall that looked ready to crack and break away we were not given clean towels each day despite leaving them on the bathroom floor as asked i accidentally put mascara on my towel in the morning and on returning to the room in the evening the towel had been neatly folded and placed back on the shelf also , we witnessed cracked tiling around stairs and the pool , derelict rooms left unlocked containing maids equipment , dangerous when kids are playing around many of the stair rails were wobbly and loose in addition , there is not much to do at the hotel other than sit around the pool ( which is nice ) or go to the beach ( also really nice ) we tried numerous times to get involved in water sports and other activities but were never successful as everytime we approached the booking shack we were told all staff were at lunch at night time it gets worse the casino is nothing short of blackpool 's funland and the shows are butlins style of course you cant leave the proximity of the hotel and so sometimes it felt like a prison this holiday was truly a distressing experience for both my boyfriend and me i have never felt so ill , isolated , angry , stressed and exhausted i was disgusted with the hotel and staff and do not agree with the advertised 4 star rating ( this hotel is rated as a 3 star in the first choice summer 2007 brochure ) my boyfriend and i are both still unwell even now after being in england for a week , resulting in us having had to take time off work and our university studies i would not recommend this hotel to anyone whatsoever please take note of this review 
trust me - stay away i have vacationed in quite a few places in caribbean , many of which were typical all - inclusives like this one the quality and amenities vary from island to island and from resort to resort , but i can honestly say that the poor quality of this place does not even come close to the worst place i had been in prior to staying here the food was atrocious i cannot believe anyone would actually serve that kind of poor quality to a customer quite literally most of it was inedible my family and i tried 3 of the al a carte restaurants and all of the buffet/poolside ones and ended up , after 3 days , resigning ourselves to a diet of raw vegetables and grilled chicken beside the pool ( which , incidentally , often came uncooked throughout - we had to cut it open before eating it or feeding to our kids however , our best efforts were not enough , towards the end of our stay our infant daughter , 3 year old son and myself all got food poisoning ( it was not from overeating and overdrinking , my wife and i do not overindulge like that anymore , certainly not with our kids in tow ) we used all bottled water for making baby formula and boiled it first in an electric kettle that we brought when the quality of the food is as poor as it was in that resort , no amount of effort will offset the inevitable the room would have been acceptable , and even comfortable , were it not for the slow but steady stream of brown liquid oozing  dripping from the bathroom ceiling and puddling on the floor the smell was of sewage our requests for repair were quickly responded to , but the problem never went away after 2 days we changed rooms - paid for an upgrade to a suite ( hoping an expensive suite would necessarily provide better quality ) alas - same problem with the bathroom i do not expect to live like royalty on these vacations ,  in fact when i 'm away i 'm intentionally in easy - going vacation mode , ready to accept many things that are different and perhaps unacceptable at home , but sewage seeping into rooms really puts a bad spin on things all of this was too bad because the layout of the resort and amenities provided were very impressive - nice grounds , lots of pools , all sorts of activities we were anticipating a great resort when we first arrived the beach was nice ( the resort does not get credit for this , it was not man - made ) , but like all large resorts it was a real cattle drive to obtain any beach chairs , and was overall quite crowded service was inconsistent ranging from very attentive to offensive it generally seemed that the bar staff were rude and the wait staff were pleasant the constant onsite flea markets that were held in the evenings initially seemed to be a way to provide convenient access for the vacationers to buy local items , but the aggressiveness of the stall - keepers along with the intrusive layout of the stalls ( literally you ran a gauntlet of offensive salespeople almost everywhere you went on the main grounds and main bar areas ) quickly became annoying there are way too many other places to go in the carribean that offer a more pleasurable holiday for the same coin all - in - all substandard and unacceptable would be good words to describe this resort , i 'll never take another chance on superclubs again , and will certainly do a lot of homework before considering another resort on d 
not recommended a group of 30 of my friends and family booked here for a wedding the trip started harmlessly enough with a 30 minute bus ride from the airport to the hotel this is where the fun began it took us close to 2 hours to book in and then on top of that our room was not ready for another 3 hours this was the same case for quite a few other people as well while waiting for the room we decided to grab a couple drinks from the closest bar the bartender was very rude , which seemed to be the treatment we received from the majority of the staff throughout the week this of course is with the exception of a few our room had a beautiful view but came with many problems including a constant musty odour the air conditioning was very poor , the ceiling and bathtub were constantly leaking , the hot water rarely worked , and we found 2 cockroaches under the bed the food in the a - la - cartes was pretty good but the buffet caused many of us to get sick in more ways than one with all of the negativity surrounding this trip i can honestly say the beach made up for alot of it white sand , accompanied by lots of sunshine , beach chairs and big waves made for a relaxing time there were many organized activities and tours to keep you busy which was great the evening entertainment was lots of fun as they made a constant effort to include anyone that was willing to make a fool of themselves on your way out of the dominican airport , be prepared to be pushed through like cattle oh and ps , stay away from the airport pizza - bad news 
poor hotel this is without doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in we had to change rooms as water came out the electrical sockets the fixtures and fittings where well past there best the second room we where given had 1 bed for 3 of us , bare electrical wires non of these faults where put right when we requested it to finish the week of we had to pay for a broken mirror that was broken when we where given the room if we hadnt have paid the hotel where going to call the police add to this food posioning and refurbisment works all over the public areas to round off a week in a rubbish hotel the wonderful beach and climate just couldnt cover over the cracks 
lovely staff , nice hotel but we stayed at breezes punta cana for two weeks in september 2006 let me start by saying that there were some aspects of this holiday that my husband and i absolutely loved the staff are the most friendly that we have have met anywhere they were always smiling and rushing to serve us at meal times and in the evening for drinks they are not paid very much but they were always laughing , dancing and singing even though it is company policy not to tip them a discreet dollar here or there does no harm the speciality restaurants were wonderful we always managed to get a reservation , there was no problem at all and it was like going out to a nice restaurant every night - dressing up a bit and being looked after by the lovely waiters and waitresses - our wine glasses were never empty the animation team worked hard - again long hours and were again extremely friendly and did their best to entertain everyone there are problems in this hotel though our room was very musty and the smell did not go off at all the sheets and towels were very much second hand - sometimes the sheets did not even fit the bed there are also security problems it seemed to us that loads of different people had keys to the rooms one afternoon whilst we were changing for afternoon tea , a woman in a white uniform just walked in without knocking , when she realised we were in the room she could not get away quickly enough also one night our room had been searched while we were at dinner - we knew this because items had been moved around and the bathroom door had been shut - we left it open after making a complaint the hotel sent us up a bottle of champagne as a way of saying sorry ( which was very nice of them ) and they upped the security on our floor we locked everything of value in the safe anyway , even my perfume , so no - one could get to it we also have had upset stomachs , the food hygeine obviously leaves alot to be desired everybody we spoke to had had the same we have been home over a week and have still not recovered from our stomach bugs which started about 5 days into the stay one couple were so bad that they ended up in hospital on drips and were trying to get home a week early being willing to pay ?500 to do so although not totally relevent to the hotel i would like to share this next experience with you i too had a trip to the hospital/medical centre - oh boy where do i start i broke my toe on the leg of the bed in our room , it just needed strapping up with a bit of tape but the dr in the medical room in the hotel insisted i go and have an x ray he was just being over cautious i guess the hospital is very poor , the sheet on the bed i was asked to lie on was dirty i did not stay on it for long the x ray was quickly performed and the a dr came out and just taped the toes together which was what i wanted in the first place our nightmare began after my treatment we were led into an admin office and immediately felt intimidated a member of staff inspected our insurance docs and then insisted upon us handing over money to them , we were later told by our insurance company we should not have given them anything they would not take cash or travellers cheques and took our credit card , they swiped it on a machine , also took an indentation of it and also took it away to photocopy it - needless to say we cancelled it the moment we got home all i would say if you are going to this hotel is : understand insurance procedure before goingtake plenty of rehydration packs and immodium with youtake micro pore and plasterstake insect repellent - deet is bestdrink loads of watertake plenty of one dollar bills for discreet tippingif you go prepared for anything then you can relax and enjoy the holiday we loved the hotel and the people and although we would not go there again we had a good time 
do not believe the brochure very disappointing described as 4-5 stars reads wonderfully in brochure in reality is more 2/3 star rooms a bit grubby , air conditioning smelled so much we had to switch it off and then the room became water logged sewage leaking from some external drains whole hotel needs more maintenance tiles slipping off roof tiles missing from pool - makeshift repairs done and broken tiles just thrown into flower beds in middle of pool along with cups and straws fridge in room rusty with pool of water in bottom toilet flushing constantly almost everyone we spoke to felt the same is quite a big hotel with not enough staff to keep up with demand had to set our own table in the restaraunt mostly around the pool sunbeds past sell buy date and most umbrellas broken - not that there were many positive points - lovely beach i did not think the food was that bad some good speciality restauraunts again on the negative you are a captive tourist and prices in hotel shop are prohibitive - ?1 00 for two paracetamol hair gel ?10 whoever is making profit from this needs to put some money back into their investment 
the microwave dinner of vacations breezes punta cana is the microwave dinner of vacations the actual meal has just a passing resemblance to the photo on the box while the website lists many ??uper inclusions , ? all the ingredients just didn?? add up on my late - july vacation the hotel interiors are dated and desperately need modernizing from the lattice work , fabric wall and oil paintings in the lobby to the 70?? rattan in the guest rooms your ??eluxe room? bed is a 6? mattress on a wooden platform the ??atellite tv? set dwarfed in an entertainment center big enough for a 32? the mirrors are stained and the bathroom ceiling appears to be falling in good luck pulling the button out to the get the shower to work step outside to a completely different world , though the landscaping is lush and beautiful the pool is huge and warm , with lots of activity whether you??e into water volleyball , aerobics or ??ex on the beach? at the swim - up bar ( also in need of renovation ) the beach is spectacular with plenty of loungers and umbrellas but all that outdoor activity has made me hungry while the website promises ?? variety of dining options? all amounts to pretty average fare the buffet is vast and filling , but with few standout dishes we are promised better cuisine with hard - to - get reservations for specialty restaurants due to a seating shortage , our 9:30 reservation at the italian restaurant got bumped back so we were finally eating at 10:15 the restaurant was stifling hot and we were literally glistening in the candlelight our salads and entrees were small and bland , but i?? glad we decided to stay for the wonderful desserts i wouldn?? have wanted to work all night in that heat , but the wait staff were very pleasant in fact , most of the breezes staff are very hospitable with great smiles and attitudes unfortunately , if a guest walked up while employees were in conversation , the guest remained invisible some of the staff are good enough to tip , if they worked on u soil , but we??e told ??o tipping allowed unfortunately , management gets it both ways here , implying no pressure on the guests , but not enforcing the rule if they were serious about their guests? they would not allow employees to accept tips for example , while we parasailed on an extra - charge activity on the property , a sign on the boat requested ??lease tip the captain br/>despite the annoying hard sell of extra - charge activities , we also chose the easy rider 4- wheeling tour our group had a great time , but someone could get hurt as the vehicles were prone to breakdowns , which our guides spent much of the time repairing some atv?? had terrible brakes , which resulted in a couple fender benders breezes management should monitor extra - charge activities so as not to jeopardize their guests? at the end of an eventful day , there?? a chance to relax and watch a show at the ampitheatre to compare ??he mystery show? to a high school production , however , is an insult to high school productions this is a shame because some of the dancers are talented during the star night show , the ??ynamic entertainment team? performed lip synching to recordings such as the madonna/brittany spears ??ike a virgin? from the video music awards this is hardly entertaining to the ??iscerning? described in the superclub supermag promotional material as with the show?? audience , i can only give my breezes punta cana experience lukewarm applause the next time i consider an all - inclusive vacation , breezes will not be included on my list 
my only expectations on vacation are good to great food , service , and nice accomadations ( room , bathroom , bed ) breezes did not meet any of those expectations it was difficult to get reservations in the restuarants , unless you were up at 6am to make them even if you were lucky enough to get a reservation , you found yourself waiting at least 2 hours for food that was not worth waiting for your alternative was the buffet , which was ok at best the rooms were outdated and ugly , with no locks on the outside patio door , a very sketchy safe , and a ceiling that leaked in the bathroom the staff there was nice , but will not rush to resolve your issues , so get used to saying the same thing 5 times before anything happens the surrounding areas are very poor and a little intimidating , this is coming from a guy that works in nyc everyday i do not suggest venturing out much unless it 's a well known touristy area in addition , they will look to charge you extra for everything at breezes for example , a friend lost the 2nd key to his room , and they made him pay 15 us dollars for a key there were more instances like this , but i would be here all day explaining so you 'll just have to trust me there were some things they could not screw up , such as the weather , which is very hot but not humid the beach was gorgeous , with plenty of beach chairs , huts , and perfect water the pool was nice with a bar inside , and plenty of activities such as snorkling , scuba , body boards , speedboats , catamaran , rtvs , etc that helps since you wo not want to spend much time in your outdated room anyway 
when it is good , it is oh so good , but when it is bad , it is horrid my family and i completed our sixth iberostar vacation ( porto plata , riviera maya , la romana twice , punta cana twice ) we have brought several families along with us on some of our vacations , and have recommended iberostar to countless others we always look forward to these family trips , and see iberostar as a trusted ??econd home? our trip to iberostar bavaro from 12/22/07-12/29/07 proved otherwise the trip started well the resort responded to my e mail , and placed us in a beachfront room (316) based on our family?? loyalty to the resort chain my three children ( ages 22, 19, 17) were in the adjoining room (315) my oldest daughter elana placed her cell phone in the safe found in the room (315) but noted that it was not functioning she closed the safe door with the phone inside , but it would not lock that evening (12/23) , i reported the broken safe to the hotel desk , but was told by the front desk clerk , in a rather curt fashion , to ??ome back tomorrow? i was a bit surprised by his lack of help in this matter ? why not simply record the room number and have it fixed the next day he would not listen to my reasoning we all had forgotten that the phone was left in the closed but unlocked safe no one in our family attempted to use the phone the entire vacation on friday , december 28, we began to pack for the return trip home it was then that we had noted that the cell phone was missing my entire family and i searched for the phone , but it was not found i reported the the theft to the hotel management they dryly stated that the phone could not be stolen ? ??here are no thefts at the resort? we must have ??isplaced it? we insisted that the phone was taken from the room , and that it was in a non - functional safe i was asked if any other people had entered the room my three children insisted that no one had one evening , i was escorted to room 315 by security who verified that the safe was indeed broken they also placed a ??ey reader? in the door they were able to determine that only one house keeper had access to the room she had eight years experience in the hotel a theft was therefore ??mpossible? my request for an incident report was turned down my questions about a police investigation were rebuffed entirely without these reports , an insurance claim would be impossible on our return to the u received the phone bill which lists a total of 177 calls made to numbers within the dominican republic with a total cost of $548 these calls were made from 12/24 ? 12/28/07 on my daughter?? phone none of these calls were made by anyone in my family it would appear evident that my daughter?? phone was indeed stolen we all can overlook the fact that this resort was not at its ??est? week we there it appeared under - staffed and over - booked the christmas season can place extreme pressure on a ??eople business? as an all - inclusive resort that can explain the less than stellar service and the absence of the overall cleanliness that we have come to expect this is understandable what i cannot accept is the way in which my family and i were treated by the hotel and its? staff as it relates to this theft we were made to feel like the guilty party we were simply told that these things don?? happen here we were given no support whatsoever this is what i feel cannot be overlooked most importantly , after phone calls and letters to : our travel agent ( doylestown travel ) , the resort itself , iberostar in miami , and their international headquarters in spain we have not gotten any response whatsoever simply put , an excellent place to stay if nothing goes wrong , but a disaster if something does 
healthy advice my wife and i just returned from a 6 night stay at the iberostar bavaro ( june 25- july 1) like most of you , i had researched our trip , checked message boards , read traveler reviews and felt well prepared and armed with everything i needed to know but the confidence i had when we left alabama was shattered when my wife was rushed by ambulance from the ib to the hospital now don?? get me wrong?? am not bashing the dr or the ib the resort was beautiful , the staff was friendly , the beach was the prettiest i have ever seen , the food was adequate , the drinks were plentiful and we always felt safe but i never really factored in one thing i read over and over again and this one thing would play a key role in our overall experience you??e read it also and i suspect you have failed to realize its implications that fact is simply this the dr is a very poor country in retrospect perhaps that is why we chose the dr for our vacations the price of the all inclusive resort in the dr compared to other tropical locations is a real value??nless something goes wrong we were having a great time when my wife started feeling nauseated 2 days into our trip within 4 hours of feeling nauseated she was throwing up uncontrollably we went to the medical facility at the ib but her condition required iv fluids and lab tests to determine what was causing her problems she was rushed by ambulance to the hospital and was admitted for 27 hours the diagnosis was a gastric bacterial infection requiring antibiotics and dehydration requiring iv fluids we??l never know how the bacteria got into her system i am sure everyone probably has an opinion as to what caused the bacterial infection but lets omit the obvious choices we didn?? drinking un - bottled water we didn?? eat any food that was not prepared by the resort we didn?? brush our teeth with tap water the doctor at the hospital told us the dr is a tropical island , and because it never gets cold , bacteria is abundant he also told us 90% of the people in the hospital are tourists on vacation who are diagnosed with gastric or respiratory bacterial infections do you have traveler?? health insurance the dr didn?? have a contract with blue cross blue shield so i paid $1,700 us for the one day in the hospital the hospital was poorly equipped and poorly staffed the room had spider webs throughout the ceiling and the wheeled iv stand would not roll because the wheels were corroded my wife was admitted to a room at 11:00pm and no one came into the room to check on her until 10:00am the next morning her iv had quit during the night and the antibiotics did not flow until they readjusted the drip the next morning the hospital had 3 floors and we were in room 306 at 3:00am i went to find a doctor or nurse to check on my wife and only found one nurse on the first floor fast asleep on her desk when i inquired about someone checking on my wife the nurse didn?? speak english when the doctor finally arrived in the room in the morning he informed my wife she needed to stay an additional night the level of ??are? was so bad my wife asked for medication that could be taken orally and we were discharged several hours later the hospital tried to charge me $121 for staying in the room with my wife ( i sat in a wooden chair all night ) i refused to pay for that charge i am hopeful bcbs will reimburse me for using an out - of - network emergency hospital admission but traveler?? insurance might be worth taking a look at if you are going to the dr here is the best advice i have to share many of you have read ??ome? remedies for traveler?? diarrhea that include taking imodium or similar products prior to your trip to prevent or stop diarrhea my wife did not use this remedy but if she had she would have been even sicker than she was when people get traveler?? diarrhea it is because their bodies are trying to rid itself of something that needs to get out if you ??ork? things up , whatever that is bad builds up inside your body and you become sicker and sicker most of the tourists hospitalized had used imodium or similar products and the results were devastating i talked to people who were having their systems flushed ( stomach pump irrigations ) in an attempt to rid their bodies of bacteria so the antibiotics could work effectively if you get diarrhea , let it flow it might be inconvenient but it won?? ruin your trip like a hospital stay will i doubt i will venture into another poverty stricken country for vacation my wife and i learned a lot about the dr saw some amazing sights met some great people but we also saw the down side of being in a country where health and medical care are at a low if you are going to the dr everything will probably be okay just be ware 
good , but not great nice and clean with beautiful pool and beaches negatives were construction going on next door that was very loud the food was below average and the drinks were watered down the japanese restaurant was very good there were not enough lounge chairs around the pool for quality sun space leaving the resort seemed very scary as the surrounding area all the way to the airport was very bad we had a bag with valuables disappear from our room and guest services did not seem very interested in helping i would recommend using the safe not a good destination for singles 
would not return my husband  i booked our trip on 4/13 through our travel agent based on the recommendation of a friend who went during christmas week we were left on our own upon leaving the plane  trying to locate the correct transfer vehicle from the airport to the hotel we were taken to the wrong van , several minutes later , we were brought to the correct one it was all quite confusing  chaotic especially since we did not speak spanish  no one was interested in speaking english we listened to very loud rap music during the 30-40 minute drive to the resort upon check in , we were given a room w/ 2 double beds i basically begged for a king  our request was granted when we rechecked after returning from lunch no other requests for room accommodation were made - no ocean view , no non - smoking room the room was dark , musty  there was no control as to the comfort level of the air conditioning the ceiling fan over the bed was either too slow ( ineffective ) or too fast ( causing a huge draft on you while you slept ) the oversize shower stall was nice , however , there was a large collection of hair on the drain  small spiders in the corner my husband stepped on a small piece of glass that was on the bedside throw rug the room safe did not work the room refrigerator was not cold so of course , the drinks were not finally , three people showed up simultaneously to correct these various problems after i made several continuous calls to the front desk , but alas , no one spoke english , so i spent another 15 minutes on the phone with the front desk reexplaining the problems to them while they then interpreted to the appropriate personnel we went to the pool to the swim up bar at 3:00pm , the pool was filled with debris , leaves , dirt , hair etc ,  there was several long hairs on the bar where we sat the drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic were horrible @ best one can make a better pina colada using a grocery store mix there was either minimal alcohol or watered down drinks which is why there probably were not any out of control , inebriated people there the food was average/below average for a resort at any of the buffets , indoors or out , it was not uncommon to see flies randomly landing here  there on all the food there was little in the way of american food as we know it the hamburg tasted very odd the buffet was very different style food , jellied , spicy , or pickled even the desserts were not worth the calories the fresh fruits were delicious , but we ate too many carbs due to the lack of options even at breakfast , the french toast  waffles were soggy the steaks  grilled chicken at the outdoor luncheon grill was excellent  the cheese pizza was surprisingly good the gourmet restaurants were delicious , but you are only allowed to go to them based on the number of nights you are staying at the resort - ie , a 4 night stay allows you to make a one night reservation for one of the restaurants people from the usa were the friendliest of the tourists , the others were rude  did not mind if you knew it was there anything good about our trip the weather was incredible - no humidity , sunny  in the 80's the ocean was an enormous pool of layers of turquoise  warm you did have to put a towel on your chair by 6:30-7:00am if you wanted ahut to be out of the sun which was rather intense i had 2 spa body wraps  two 30 minute back/shoulder massages all for the price of what i have paid at some resorts for just 1 massage a great bargain the most disconcerting thing that occurred was that on the morning we left , we went to breakfast , leaving our 2 checked luggage bags outside our door as instructed , placed the do not disturb sign on the door , closed the curtains  went to breakfast my husband left a $10 bill on the table as a tip for our stay when we returned , our room was the way we left it with one exception - the money was gone  so was my makeup bag , brushes , etc we already had one experience w/ leaving 2 facecloths in a drawer so we would have extras and later finding them gone , obviously someone had gone through our things we did file a report , but could not see it through , we had to get to the front of the resort to be picked up for the airport the bus was 45 mins late  no one kept us informed as to the delay we got to the airport  wanted to purchase the photo they took of us when we entered the airport upon our arrival  they could not find it nor did they go out of their way to locate it 
would not go back we stayed with a large group for 7 nights the hotel grounds are beautiful as is the beach food was plentiful but just okay all the children we travelled with at some point had some stomach issues , they did not drink the water , we were told that they should not use the tap water at all , so we brushed teeth with bottled water the hotel grounds are very large and therefore when you are travelling with children not an easy task to keep an eye there are no organized activities for children , no pool games , etc we hardly saw the star friends for the children and they were not accommodating in this fashion i would not go back and be weary if you are travelling with children , as i feel it was not a children friendly place the staff was also not that friendly and were not accommodating 
ok nothing great i have to say that the bavaro to me was just average it wasnt ' terrible but it certainly wasnt fabulous to me it had more cons then pro 's the first thing that everyone considering going here should know is that it is not very child friendly if you have a small child this is not a good place from the unsafe walkways , slippery bathroom floors and useless steps in the rooms a parent with a toddler will not have a minute to relax all the walkways and pool area are increte which is a painted cement with a design etched in it when it is wet , which is almost all the time because of the frequent rain storms throughout the day and night , it is very dangerous one afternoon after a rain storm i watched 2 adults slip and fall both were injured and there are signs everywhere about the slippery surfaces so if there know they are dangerous get rid of them it goes without saying how many children i saw by the pool go down , including my own from just walking and hitting a wet spot the room was also a hazard though it was very pretty , the floors were all marble mix that with a shower door that is not water tight and once again you have a very dangerous situation for a child my one year old slammed his head on the floor our first day there when he walked into the bathroom my 5 year old niece did the same thing a few days later then there the steps a 4 foot wide 2 step down which is impossibe to block off the food was also alitlle lacking not thay i had anything bad there just wasnt anything that i felt i needed to have again the buffet was small and didnt offer much of a variety the menu wasnt child friendly either if you have picky eaters make sure you bring some stuff from home for them to eat there were not very many healthy choices either the veggie choices were lacking but there was alot of unknown fried objects there was not even whole wheat bread at breakfast and if you ordered room service thy would not bring you a beverage one night me and my husband wanted a cup of coffee so we called room service they told us they dont deliver beverages with 2 small children sleeping it was not like we could walk ( and i do mean walk ) to the buffet to get some place is alot of buildings its large but it doesnt really have much to offer the size is mainly due to all of the bungalows bavaro has the 5 or 6 resturants , the pool , a few shops and a theater which by the way does not have profesional entertainers it was all audience particpants if that sort of thing matters toyou the shows are hosted by the same group that does the 20 minutes of pool games in the afternoon after that there really isnt much more entertainment than that if you want internet access , the casino , the disco , the doctor , the kids club and mostly everything else you might need on your vacation you need to walk to the next hotel ( think that one was the domincana ) the pool was warm enough to actually swim in which was nice but once again vey slippery for young chidren there is a large fountain in the middle that when it is windy you get hit with the spray from the fountain ( very annoying ) the high point of the bavaro is the beach powdery soft sand and a beautiful ocean warm and a little wavey it was mine and my childrens favorite part of the trip to sum this up because of know i am rambling the bavaro is lacking considering its 5 star rating i am not a travel snob i am just honest i have been to other resorts in the dr and found them to be more enjoyable ok for 1 time wouldnt go backwould go back to sunscape in laromona smaller and alot nicer of a vacation 
mixed emotions i just returned from punta cana occidental grand upon arrival i was taken back by the beautiful beach and pools that occidental had to offer the first two days of my vacation were great however , on the third day (12/14/08) i became sick after eating at the mexican restaurant i purchased some immodium ( $3 00 per pack - 2 tablets ) , make sure you bring your own with you this did not help to date , i am still sick i thought i would return to punta cana until i got sick eventhough the place is beautiful , i cannot return with the fear of getting sick 
resort is getting old hello , this is a brief comment about this hotel , i wo not go into many details , however the simple fact is the grounds are nice but the hotel is too old , we had trouble with the plumbing in our room , the water was turned off a few times during the day which i think is an ongoing problem , the problem with the piping is a bigger issue than what meets the eye , we think it 's the infrastructure the food at the buffet was not bad but i found the a la carte restaurants really bad , the wine specially was not good and it seemed watered down and it did not even taste like wine , the waiter poured wine in our glasses and when we tasted it , it tasted like vinegar , we asked him to take our glasses away , and also if he could give us wine from a different bottle , we think he went into the kitchen and poured the wine from our glasses into another bottle , it tasted exactly the same and it had enough for two glasses , everyone was complaining about it all and all , i and my husband had a good holiday , we liked the beach , we are simple people 
you get what you pay for we booked our trip the week or two before we left we traveled back in may of 2008, about 6 months ago we paid only $1800 for both of us combined , amazing but the sadly , the resort definitely had its problems thankfully , we 're both laid - back and are not going to let some issues get in the way of having a good vacation the night we arrived , we got to the hotel around 10pm it was pitch black , save for the lit candles inside the lobby there was a power outage on the resort we checked in amidst the darkness , and then were driven to our building the bell - boy took our luggage up to our room and showed us inside waiting for our approval it 's still pitch black , and the glow of his cell - phone , although innovative , was not going to help us determine if it was acceptable we said it was fine during our 7- night stay , we had 3 power outages also , in our room ( not sure how many others in the same building had this problem ) , we were lacking hot water in the shower the tap at the bottom worked , but the hot water could not find it 's way to the shower head cold showers and 3 power outages oh yes , also , the resort has 3 pools the main pool , the club pool , and the smaller , quieter one right behind our building unfortunately that smaller , quieter pool had a sewage backup and was shut down the food at the a la cartes not - so - good the chinese was excellent , and the taco place upstairs was awesome the rest was just awful the buffet was the best bet ( but you can rarely ever go wrong with a buffet the maid service was a bit slow some days we returned to our room at 3pm or 4pm and the beds were still not made , and there were still no new towels when it was done though , they did it well aside from these negatives , we found ways to truly enjoy ourselves the first weekend of our stay was during the usa 's memorial day weekend ( or something ) so there was a massive party happening hosted by radio stations hot 97 great - if you 're like us and looking for a party we met a lot of great people , the music and entertainment were awesome the staff was fairly courteous ( not outstanding but not disappointing ) the nightly shows were fun and very entertaining the drinks were always made just right : - ) the beach was relatively clean the pools ( except the clogged up one ) and their surrounding areas were kept very clean if you 're looking for a fabulous vacation , i would not recommend this resort but if you 're looking for just a place to stay , you wo not do too bad here 
i just returned from a week stay at occidental , and i have to say , the beaches of punta cana are beautiful , but there is very little to be be said for the hotel the staff was pleasant , and the grounds were pretty , but as a single female traveler , i felt very uncomfortable by several of the male employees who were following me around the resort , asking if i was alone it freaked me out also , i was probably one of the only single travelers there not what my travel agent told me the food was beyond awful i actually got food poisoning they charge $120 to see the hotel doctor at my orientation day the second day , they told us not to drink the water telling us on day one would have helped stick with the bottled water like i did we lost electricity almost every night ( no generators onsite ) , and the sink and shower water was a nice shade of pale yellow if it were not for the nice beaches , i would have called my travel agent to get me out of the resort spend the extra money and go somewhere with good reviews i 've never been somewhere this bad 
**never again **worst hotel i 've stayed in caribbean** let me start by saying this hotel had the worst service of anycaribbean hotel i have ever stayed i go to all - inclusive so i will not be harrassed every day i washarrassed to buy something the rooms were shabby and the bathroom was horrible no hot water , some days no towels for 3 days for about 3 hours there was no power or water no one advised us and when i asked they said everyone wasadvised the food was average , but the 5 or so restaurants you could choose from were not all available , only on certain days you could pick from only 2 if it was not for the beach i would have been miserable 
trust the reviews just returned from a one week vacation at the occidental grand flamenco with my fiancee wish we knew of tripadvisor before we booked - never would have gone - trust the reviews we have been to punta cana several times before and have traveled to many other places , including the bahamas , jamaica and aruba - we know what to expect if you gave us a free vacation , including air fare and $500 spending money , to return to the occidental , we would turn it down without hesitation now the review : check in : - no organization , just chaos after a 40 minute wait just to speak with someone at the desk , our room was not ready no big deal , it was 2:45pm - return at three we did get our wrist bracelets and headed for the bar 3pm - not ready 3:30pm - not ready 4pm - not ready 4:15pm - not ready 4:30pm was assigned room 323 in building 26 - as we were told - that is a nice room with an ocean view we headed to the room - and walked and walked and walked finally we reached building 26 the view was of a walkway and a children?? playground - no ocean looked for the safe deposit box found one in the closet and saw the lock missing was never informed at the desk that you have to pay $25 for the lock went back to the desk to change to a building closer to the main area assigned building 11 room 223 the only positive about this building was that it was closer to the main area this room has seen better days many , many years ago the room had two full size beds pushed together broken bulb and broken glass on shelf in closet knobs missing from closet door sliding glass doors to balcony had broken locks and could not be secured - had to jam a table between them for security no towels in the bathroom - finally received two bath towels - no hand towels or face cloths no water pressure and many times no water at all toilet would not properly flush - took up to five times just to get it to work properly noticed all of the toilets were like this in the public areas - it was disgusting linen was never changed pool was nice and appeared clean lounge chairs were a hassle want a pool towel do not bother to look for a towel hut by the pool get ready to walk and walk and walk - all the way to the beach - a good 15 minute walk round trip you want to have a pool towel already in your room there is a catch - i will tell you later on what the catch is - no it 's not tipping food - buffet was ok - not great by any means food at many times was cold restaurants - 4 or 5 of them where you need to book reservations - 6:30 sitting or 9:30pm do not waste your time - tried the steak restaurant - small salad buffet main course - waiter comes with a skewer with sausage on it - not tasty next skewer - dried chicken third and last skewer - steak another waiter dropped a small saucer with one small carrot , one small piece of broccoli , and literally a 1/4 cup of rice - that plate was for two italian restaurant - stayed 10 minutes - went to the buffet premium liquor - in the evening they set up a stand in the lobby where you can purchase premium liquor drinks paid $7 00 for an amaretto and oj gave me a glass with the amaretto - where 's the oj you have to walk to the bar to get it? that is a class act i 'm a born and bred new yorker - do not expect a lot , but not this kind of service service - 90% of the staff are not friendly there is no reaction , no greetings as i have said in the beginning , i travel , and this is the worst employee interaction i ever experienced it seemed to my fiancee and i that many of the wait staff despised the guests they were serving i am a very friendly and outgoing guy went to my bank before my vacation to get a lot of small bills of tens , fives , and ones for extra tips beach was nice - just do not go in the restricted area that is reserved for special guests went to the beach bar - ordered two drinks - the female bartenders started to laugh wrong color wrist bracelet - that was the special guests bar where 's the bar for the common folk - pointed to the other end of the beach walked and walked told my girl to pull up stakes and move down to the far end of the beach - by the common folks bar pool towels - want one in your room here 's the catch - on monday when i was looking for the towels i asked an employee that was wearing a white shirt with a name tag he was very nice and said he would walk us to where the towels were on the way he talked on how we could have booked this vacation without the travel agent , get better rooms with the towels already in them , and save a ton of money by booking direct with occidental he would give me the information the next day being from ny i do not trust anyone and figured out that it will probably be a time share type deal the next day he saw us coming from breakfast - i asked him what the real deal was - he stated he was a chance for a vacation club and pleaded with us just to go upstairs so he could get his points for the humor factor i went upstairs wanted to take a picture of us to put on a bottle of liquor free please fill out this questionnaire introduced to a salesman - straight out i asked what are you selling and what it costs 
beware of this hotel you may not get what you paid for i am trying to be very politically correct , however , my vacation at this resort leaves me with very little room to do so it all started when i arrived at this resort on feb i was told after about a 20 minute wait at the reception desk , that there seemed to be a problem , and that the hotel was overbooked , however , they had a very nice room for me as i was shown the room , in the edifficio 11 ( bldg 11) , i was surprised to see this dilapidated room , with only one king size bed ( and i happened to be on vacation with my mother , we are ages 36  54, so sleeping together was not an option ) , a strange bug spray/mold odor , and bathroom that appeared to be falling apart now i suppose this would work for some , however , i was paid for and booked in the royal club ( a vip section of this hotel , that is much higher priced than the regular room rate ) , specifically pre - requested a room in the rc with 2 beds and a non - smoking ocean view deluxe room long story short , i was repeatedly told that my royal club room would be available the next night , and had to be moved to 4 different rooms before a somewhat decent sleeping area was arraigned ( edifficio 24, a very nice bldg , however , since half of the hotel is being upgraded , stay away from bldgs , 11, 13, and try to request something in the 20's if your not going to the royal club ) and after many heated discussion with management ( metz was the mgr at the main lobby , who was tolerant but not very helpful initially ) i was finally able to settle into the temporary room the food is horrible , the staff is incredibly rude ( except for albert from the beach bar at the royal club , and one of the recp at the royal club reception i believe her name was juana ) if your going to this resort , have low expectations , bring lots of singles ( atm in the main lobby does not advertise the fees charged which is $5 us per transaction + a 3-4% additional fee based on the amount of money withdrawn ) , and bring extra toiletries , as they tend to sell common products at ridiculously expensive prices , and if you can buy international calling cards at home , do so , as i paid $20 us dollars for one that i was told had 20 minutes of airtime ( do not forget the resorts fee of $2 us for each connection to place a call ) , and the card only had 12 minutes on it also , do not forget the bug spray , especially in the evening and at night finally , after all of the stress upon my arrival , and some fighting for some kind of compensation ( which was an upgrade to a 3rd flr oceanview suite in the royal club , and a bottle of champagne , and two 30 min massages , which we had to repeatedly ask for ) , your best bet is to stay somewhere else i am still awaiting my reimbursement for one day that we were not in the rc i wo not be back to this hotel , ever if your staying at this hotel , hopefully you 've splurged for the royal club , or you may be even more disappointed than i was the most positive thing i can say is club mangu ( located right outside of the hotel property ) on friday and saturday night was the most fun of my entire vacation stay elsewhere , but def hit club mangu 
vacation nightmare - toxic rooms 2/17/2008to occidental grand flamenco management : we recently vacationed at occidental grand flamenco in punta cana and we booked the romantic vacation package from 2/9 - 2/16 the purpose of letter is to describe our romantic vacation nightmare on your property in addition , we want to know how we going to be compensated for the worst vacation we have been on upon our arrival on 2/9, the nightmare vacation began : we waiting on line to register with the hotel and when we finally were able to register , registration could not find our reservation after many minutes , registration found our reservation and we were told the room was not ready to come back 30 minutes we waiting on line an addition 2x before our room was ready we asked for 2 keys and we were told ??h no? we only have 1 key we asked a bellman to help with the luggage and bring us to the room and we were told ??h no? which was the beginning of many ??h no??? therefore , we dragged our luggage , found building 22-225, and carried our bags up a flight of stairs to our room room 22-225 was a toxic and unhealthy room and i came home from vacation sick here are some of the situations that we found with this room : room was toxic with mildew and moldroom was not readyno sheets on the bedno towels in bathroomtoilet brokenromantic package was not immediately providedno coffee potno lock on safeno remote control for tvi called the front desk and complained and within a few minuets , some one came and put clean sheets and dirty blankets on the bed and floor mats were delivered as towels when i asked about the coffee pot , they told me it was in the refrigerator after complaining on the phone and little action was taken , we went to the lobby once again had to wait on a line and ask for a manager , his name was mintz we gave him a list of our problems and asked if we could be switch to another room and his response was ??h no? you will need to speak to your vip representative tomorrow morning at 9:30am we spent our entire first day in the lobby day 2 we have to take ice cold shower since there was no hot water and could not flush the toilet on our way out the door to meet our representative , we walk into a flood in the hallway from the room across the way we meet wendy our reprehensive from vip at 9:30 in the lobby for orientation we give her a list of problems and she stated they would be fixed by 4pm if they are not fixed we wanted to be switched to a healthy room or another hotel after meeting with wendy we had to get back on line to get a lock for the safe in the room only to be told ??h no? we have none left then we had to move to guess services and wait on another line to get vouchers for our romantic package by the time we left the lobby it was close to 12noon we spend our first day and half of our second day in the lobby a day or two later it rained in the evening and the room across the way had rain pouring down in their closet needless to say , the guests were very upset maintenance knocks on our door at 10:30pm to see if your room had rained this was the beginning scene every night there after , walkie talkies screeching , people yelling and moving the vacationers out of the room and guess what? the next day they would put more guests in this room only for it to happen repeatedly every night was disrupted with guest being upset because it was raining in there room there was not one night were we got a good night sleep on valentines day we received our romantic massage that was just 30 minutes long later on that day the water on the property was turn off from 1pm to 6pm there was no running water anywhere this was the day of our romantic dinner in the steak restaurant that was another joke they put us at a table right next to the kitchen , were waiters were coming in and out what a disappointment this vacation was very stressful , not to mention the room was toxic we came back more stressed out then when we left and have sinus infection due to the mold and mildew in the room we would like to be compensated for this vacation we would like a monetary refund or another vacation at your expense at a different property 
terrilbe/non - existent management is the downfall of the hotel my wife and i have been to the domican republic several times before , and even got engaged there , so i feel we have a good sense of what can be expected in this country in fact , we had a soft spot for the dr we were on a family trip this time , celebrating an aunt and uncles 25th anniversary with both our parents and siblings the occidental has some positives , but overall our experience had so many negative aspects to it that i doubt we will ever return to the dominican i will start with the positives : the hotel layout is nice , the staff does a good job of keeping things clean the bartenders do an admirable job of hustling despite the fact very few people tipthe late night pizza ( available until 6 am ) was surprisingly goodthe club mangu is by far the most happening club we had ever seen in the dr sadly - on to the negativesthe first problem we encountered was with the quality of our room our room had 2 twin beds pushed together ( rather than a king which would be more appropriate for a married couple ) , non functional ac , a non functional fan , and a shower that was better described as a slow drip that alternated between ice cold and scaldingly hot we were pretty miserable this first night , since neither the ac nor the fan worked we subsequently found out we had been allocated a non renovated room the rest of our group had all been allocated renovated rooms getting moved to a renovated room ended up being a major challenge we kept being informed a manager was not around and they could not move us without approval from one of them , finally , when a manager did arrive the nect morning , he tried to stay back in his office and have the reception attendant try to pass messages back and forth it made us feel ridiculous we insisted on speaking to the manager directly he tried to say the resort was full , which was a complete lie ( later we found out they were at 60% capacity ) , and that no renovated rooms were available this was after seeing many many people wheeling suitcases from all the different buildings all over the resort that morning to check out finally , after 3 more trips to the reception culminating with asking for a meeting with the general manager , a renovated room finally magically appeared for us there really was no reason for the situation to get to this point , however given there were 4 problems with our room and there were plenty of rooms available , we should have been moved immediately our experience with the management on this issue , or lack of since the managers were rarely available , was repeated in other scenarios several times over the remainder of the trip the staff often has a stop bothering us , we are just chilling attitude for example , the day before we left i was trying to find out what time our bus would pick us up for the airport i was informed i had to speak to the person that coordinated the bus , and that they were currently in the back of the lobby i went to try to find them , they were not there when i told this to the rep at the front desk , i was told they might be at the theatre now , but in any case would be around the property for a couple more hours and i should just wander around trying to find them this was pretty annoying the day before we had to leave , and i wanted to get back to the beach i asked them to just find the person coordinating the bus themselves , or make a phone call to find out the bus time and just send a message to our room with the time although this experience was not so terrible in its own right , i think it just shows the pervasive attitude of the staff there was a constant stream of people complaining about various things at the front desk , which created a negative atmosphere and quickly eroded our confidence in how things were being run the food is not good a consensus quickly emerged that the buffet was the best choice ( as opposed to the specialty restaurants ) it was an interesting phenomenon to see all the restaurants nearly empty but a line out the door for the buffet most of us had issues in the bathroom from the second day onward the reception staff , and lack of constant manager presence , leaves guests with the impression there is nobody to turn to about problems a quick example here , i was working out in the fitness room one afternoon the employee on duty approached me and asked me where i was from , after which he told me that god was number one for him and asked where he ranked for me he then told me he was a christian , etc i was a bit at a loss at how to respond but i just smiled and returned to my workout after this exchange he proceeded to go to the corner of the fitness room and chanting various prayers at the top of his voice i spiritu sankti , etc this went on for the next 20 minutes of my workout after the earlier frustrations at the front desk , i thought if i told them this story they would just laugh about their funny colleague , so i never ever bothered to tell anybody about it another negative was the quality of the nighttime entertainment we actually had very low expectations from our previous trips however , the occidental took things to a new low for example , one night the mc spent 45 minutes playing the i am thinking of a number between 75 and 95 game and then 120 - 140 after the first one was guessed and so on and so on we had a problem with the staff ignoring the do not disturb signs twice , they walked on on us taking a nap a final issue i will discuss is not completely the hotels fault , although they played a role we asked at the concierge how we could book deep sea fishing they recommended a company we spoke to the owner in person and arranged a very specific deal we wanted to keep all the fish we caught , have it cleaned by the staff and then have it cooked at a local restaurant he quoted a price for this type of package , and told us that a friend of his that owned a restaurant had agreed to cook the fish as a favor as long as we bought drinks and side orders from his restaurant we went out and caught 2 large mahi mahi that we took back to shore after which we had a series of unpleasant episodes first , the boat staff told us they usually get to keep the fish , or at least one fish so we had to argue about the fact we already had agreed with the owner to keep all the fish then , none of the staff wanted to clean the fish without additional tip , although we had already discussed this point with the owner as well finally , the restaurant owner told us he would not cook the fish unless he got to keep all the extra fish we could not eat on the spot ( this was no good because we promised cooked fish to our wives and girlfriends ) so it made us feel like everybody was constantly trying to scam us and take a piece out of us on every possible chance we finally got the fish cooked at another small local place nearby for a reasonable sum , but we should not have had to pay anything more since we had been very exact in our negotiations the owner of the boat was not available for all this time for anybody to call despite for success of the trip in terms of the fish , we actually returned really bummed out about the dr since we felt everybody was trying to scam us we resolved not to leave the resort for any other trips i would really suggest avoiding leaving the resort finally , it actually ended up being a funny joke to us , but the staff managed to incorrectly spell happy 25th anniversary on the cake we ordered for my aunt and uncle to conclude , i would just avoid the occidental in order to improve matters at the property , i think they would have to completely overhaul the management and rethink how they organize everything at the hotel 
don " t go to this place i just returned from the worst hotel i have ever stayed in let me begin by saying the communication from the staff is lacking to say the least when my wife and i and another couple first arrived the problems began the hotel did not have our reservation and it took them over 2 hours to get us both rooms while this was going on , the completely ignored us like we were not even standing in front of them so since they were ignoring us , i started to take a quick look around the lobby furniture looked like it had been there since it first opened the main pool was closed which i was told it had been for the past 3 weeks after being told it is opening the next day for 2 days , it finally opened the buffet restaurant had patched holes in the ceilings throughout the entire place finally we get our rooms a partial ocean view well only if you lean your entire body over the balcony the room i stayed in had rust and mildew in the shower and it was missing the drain cover the toilet was repaired by god only knows who because the amount of sealant on the bottom of it could have done the entire bathroom twice we also had lovely bugs coming out of the sick , which we complained about and was told , you must be on the first floor after my complaints with my friends having problems in their room too , we both were told by cesar at the front desk to come back in an hour ( they say that whenever you need something ) and he would have 2 ocean view rooms for us to check into one of the rooms was available at that time and one was checking out and needed to be cleaned my friend and i accepted that from him and returned in that hour when we got back , he told us one minute ( an hour later ) he will take care of us after sitting in the lobby and getting impatient , we went up to the desk and asked for cesar we were told that he left for the day and they have no idea what we were talking about we got upset to say the least they offered us one ocean view room we checked it and found the ac broken and even one of the staff said it too but management said there was nothing wrong well we stayed in the room we had and my friend got the room next to us now on to the food one of the restaurants that they booked for us was closed when we got there due to repairs do not you think they would tell us before they booked it for us well the food was gross and the wine we were served ( house wine ) looked and tasted nasty all the liquor was bottom shelf and if you wanted to purchase top shelf , they gave you the equivalent of a shot the language barrier between some of the guests and all of the staff was terrible if you do not know spanish , you are in trouble if the promoters did not stop harassing us , we were going to scream they have a job to do but it gets under your skin after telling them 50 million times no the shows we did not go to because it was mostly in their language and the casino was about the size of a studio apartment i can go on and on forever telling people how bad it was but the bottom line is , find another resort other than this one 
vacation gone wrong i just came home from the hotel from hell we had a large group of us attending our good friends wedding from the time we checked in , till the time we left , they made no effort to help with not one problem we had no clean towels , no grand pool with bar ( under construction ) , no hot water for many rooms , one night at a resturant with an opening all other nights booked we also had the worst time with needing a voucher to do everything the management was just a absolute joke the list goes on and on with this place the best thing about the trip was the good times we had as a group making the best out of it our friends wedding thank god turned out perfect , the rest was unexceptable my advice to someone looking into this hotel is look some more 
trip from hell we recently stayed at this resort from nov 8-12 with a large group as our great friends got married here i will first say the great things about the trip were we were there with good friends , the beaches were beautiful , and the wedding was very nice before i went on this trip i was reading all the reviews and tried going there with an open mind but is was a nightmare i was there for 5 days i had warm water to shower 1 night , another night i took a shower in the one pool that was opened because we did not have power for 4 hours we never had clean towels , the food is a joke you ca not make a reservation even the moring of we did get lucky and the one night we had reservations at the itialian rest and they had no air hot as can be and the service was so bad we were the first seating they ran out of lasagne and red sauce at an itialian restuarant so do not plan on having good food while you there i will say it may be the first vacation i think i lost weight the only good thing i have to say about this whole trip is if it were not that i was with my best of friends it would 've been even worst but we had to just make the best of it i do not ever complain about things but this was bad , i 'm telling you do not stay here the only thing i can think of that people that have good reviews about this place is that they have never been anyplace else i am totally game for any feedback anyone would like i suggest if going to punta cana stay at paridisius i did hear from many other 's here at the same time that paridisus truely was paridise 
i wished i had stayed home we stayed at the occidental grand punta cana it gets confusing since there as several occidental properties in punta cana i want to make sure the right property gets credit for their poor performance let 's start with the 2 hour check in when we were the only people in line and they could not find my reservation even though i gave them the liberty travel voucher we were finally given a key to a room that someone was already occupying i am handicapped and requested a first floor room only to be put on the second floor with no elevators we went 3 days before they got us air conditioning , one day with no hot water , 7 days with mold and part of the bathroom ceiling missing as well as a tub that we wore sandles in due to the dark discoloration lanquage is a problem here as many of the staff do not speak english the food is poor at best i actually lost weight at an all inclusive my biggest complaint though is the constant harrassment we received from the staff that tried to sell us time shares when the sun finally came out and i was trying to relax on the beach and get some sleep the staff had no problem waking me up to sell me on the benifits of their time shares additionally the beach is not private so the locals go through constantly whistling trying to sell their wares by the way they closed the pool for 3 weeks that you see the pictures of with the swim up bar , there was no warning the beach and the ocean are beautiful as are the grounds but the other problems are far to pervasive to overlook i stayed at sandles montego bay last year and they earned their star rating how this resort ever got a 4 1/2 star rating is beyond me 
dissapoinment we stayed there fromaug 4 to aug 11,2007 it is suppose to be a4 5 stars well it was not we stayed at buildind #23 there were holes in the screens , bath tubs were rusted , furniture was broken , shower curtains were dirty and at times there was not enough water pressure to flush the toillet and take a shower they also fumigated the room while we were there the specialty restaurants were mediocore with the service and the quality of the food a few of them the ac did not work tht is enough because there was more 
you do not get what you pay for we went to the bavaro princess for a summer vacation in july 2008 honestly , it was the worst vacation we 've ever had we had nothing but problems from the time we arrived , starting with trying to check in that was a big fiasco we had upgraded to the platinum package before leaving home , but the hotel could not find any record of that we had to pay for it again if you want anything resembling service , though , you have to get the platinum package the food was terrible everything is buffet unless you make reservations at the restaurants , and those are very difficult to make without argument with the platinum package , you get to make reservations at the gourmet restaurant chopin , but that is almost a joke for instance , my wife ordered something called shrimp - stuffed portobello mushroom with hollandaise sauce when it came out , it really looked like canned dog food there was no portobello ( only domestic mushroom pieces ) , no shrimp ( just chicken ) , and no hollandaise sauce ( tomato - based ) we tried to complain in english and spanish ( my wife is fluent ) , but the waiter seemed unable to comprehend either the rooms look ok at first sight they are typical caribbean construction ( cement ) the a/c did not work very well , and the bathroom was not included in the air - conditioning we had small black bugs in our bed on two different nights , and we had large geckos running around our room on two other nights the best part of the stay was the beach the dr has some nice beaches , and we actually stayed out there more than anywhere else if you are planning on vacationing in the dr , learn spanish and stay somewhere else 
do not stay here save your money i booked this trip through a travel agent who swore up and down it was a great place i wo not beat around the bush if you want the truth here it is :1 the rooms were musty and smelled we have had to wash our clothes several times since we got back to get the smell out the food was ok by no means gourmet the hispanola buffet was garbage mcdonalds would have been better food the employees , including the concierge , did not speak english i understand this is a foreign country , but i feel there should have been people on duty at all times that were multi - lingual in case of an emergency there were tourists from all over the world , and i listened to them struggling to communicate i was very worried having my wife and three daughters with me that if something bad was to have happened , we would be in big trouble we went outside the front gate to shop for trinkets the hotel prices were highway robbery ( $9 00 for a tiny tube of anti - biotic cream for a cut the 24 hour doctor on the premises wanted to charge me $40 00 us for a perscription for the same cream at the local shops the vendors were high pressure , which you expect , but when you would not pay the outrageous prices , they yelled at you and said things like you are rich , we are poor you should give us money i was shocked my wife found a small snake in the bath tub it took off down the drain when i tried to get it you have to pay for the platinum club ( $30 00 a day per person , even kids ) for top shelf liquor the bottom shelf liquor was garbage , and the drinks were made in 8 oz the beach was nice , however , there were people walking up and down trying to sell excursions i just wanted to lay in the sun and relax , not deal with salesmen all day do not waste your money here 
not a 5 star resort first trip to the dominican republic and the worst hotel ever when my boyfriend i first checked into the room and looked it over there was blood on the bathroom room door , when i complained they said they would sent someone to clean it , on the third day i finally cleaned it myself the room was never cleaned , the maids just came in and made the beds and changed the towels this service was never completed before 5:30pm the towel service at the pool and beach was on some days more than a 20 minute wait we were told that there was a disco on site , when we arrived we were told that it was outside of the hotels grounds there was no bottles of rum in the room and no welcome baskets that we were told that other guests recieved the over all service is not something i would have expected from a 5 star resort i was very disappointed with the hotels over all and would not recommend it to anyone 
never again my husband and i just came back from bavaro princess last saturday we even paid extra just to get home early this vacation was one of the biggest disappointments ever i wish i had read the postings on this website before we booked our vacation although from the appearance of our room it looked liked it was very nice just wait until the middle of the night when the cockroaches come out it got to the point where i made my husband go on bug duty before i could even use the bathroom we saw several roaches scurrying for cover when we turned on the lights in the bathroom in the evenings some mornings we would even find dead roaches lying on the floor in the main room both of us would wake in the morning with bites on our legs , backs , and sides we 're sure there must have been bed bugs service at this hotel is almost non - existent although we were only the 4th couple in line we waited over an hour to check in while dining in the restaurants we were lucky if we could even get our water glasses filled the food in the restaurants was mediocre at best not sure if i got a touch of a bug from the food or just an upset stomach the japanese restaurant however , was very good the beach was beautiful be warned though if you are sitting under a palm tree or a tiki hut you will most likely encounter spiders crawling on you while you rest this would probably happen at any beach though the non - motorized water activity stand that was supposed to be included required a deposit for any equipment you wanted to use sure it was only a deposit but the whole point of the all - inclusive is that you do not need to carry any money with you also fellow guests were very rude at the beach the days we went to the beach we arrived between 8:30 am and 9:00 am the beach itself was practically empty however people had come by and placed their belongings on the prime real estate lounge chairs then do not come back until 11 or 12 this is not fair to the people like us who are there at the beach to actually use the chairs although hotel policy states that unattended belongings left on chairs for more than 30 minutes will be removed this does not happen and we had even gotten into an argument with a couple after we had been accused of stealing their chairs although we had been sitting in them for 90 minutes already the pool seems to have the same situation regarding chairs although we did not spend much time at the pool one evening as we left the seafood restaurant we looked at the empty pool floating in one end was vomit , noodles actually floating in the water the pool was already closed for the evening at this point and maintenance crews were adding the chemicals why they were not removing the vomit i do not know also , on tuesday a baby snake had fallen from the grass roof above the swim up bar into the pool i hate snakes these two incidents were enough to keep us out of the pool finally , the worst part of our vacation my husband developed a large red spot on his forehead during our second full day we initially thought this was some sort of spider bite as we had fallen asleep on the beach as the days passed it grew larger and larger finally on thursday night we decided we needed to get home so he could have it looked at by a doctor back in the us we messed around with the apple reps for so long on friday morning that we were not able to make any of the flights out that day we finally said fine put us on the first flight back to the us on saturday morning , we do not care what city it flies into we 'll figure out how to get home from there on our own we were told that flight had 3 seats available we said great we 'll take that flight only to be told we could not be guaranteed this flight we would have to go stand - by in the end it worked out and we did get on the first flight out saturday morning after a long day of traveling on saturday my husband decided to take some benedryl for the bite on his head saturday night and get to the er first thing sunday morning sunday morning the swelling on his forehead had spread and he could barely open his right eye when he got to the er the doctor told him that it was not a bite after all , instead he had contracted some sort of infection we still do not know what it is whether it is viral or bacterial he is on antibiotics for both for the next 7 days we are uncertain for sure on how this infection was contracted but we do have a guess when we were at the beach on monday , our first full day we were approached by the hotel photographers to have our picture taken with their monkey we thought it would be a cute picture it was a cute picture we actually bought a copy from the hotel that evening however , it seems very likely that as the monkey moved from sitting on my husbands shoulder up to sit on the top of his head the monkey may have inadvertently scratched him on the forehead thus contracting the infection be warned to stay away from any animals while in a foreign country you never know how well they are taken care of in terms of illnesses 
terrible overall we read the reviews but did not believe this hotel is aweful we are not picky , but this resort is horrible our rooms smelled of mildew we asked around and most people agreed that the rooms were smelly the room also had little bugs and the matress smelled also we have traveled all over and this was the worst hotel we have ever stayed at the food was okay , but the service was terrible the wait staff was miserable and rude it took forever to get a cup of coffee we requested a new matress due to a back problem , at first they told us no problem but they never gave us a new one and told us to sleep on the floor the pool had 2 restaurants that burnt down a few weeks back and debris is all over the pool area they were also jackhammering the entire time we were at the pool the pools are also dirty and slippery around the edges because of the debris the food on the beach is horrible with flies constantly swarmimg around there was no nightlife , the shows were absolutley terrible , i could have put on a better show this hotel is definitley not worth going to , it 's worth spending the extra money on a better resort 
the only vacation i ever starved on i 'm typically the type of traveler that does not stay in resorts my little sister was getting married in punta cana and all the guests arranged their travel plans through the same travel agent we all stayed in the bavarro princess hotel my first problem was that after a long trip from new york to punta cana , we were not able to immediately check in to our room we got to the hotel at 11am and could not check in until after 3pm we were hungry naturally but could not eat until 12:30 the only thing available to eat was basically fast food burgers and fries that were not even as good as mcdonalds at 12:30 there was a buffet that reminded me of school lunch we finally checked into our room and found out that if we wanted to eat anything outside of the buffet we had to make reservations but by the time we got settled in our room and made it to the reservation desk it was too late the manager actually said to us that he did not care because he still gets paid the same that was a friday breakfast on saturday stopped being served at 10 we were so tired we slept in as people do on vacation so we missed it thank god saturday evening was the wedding because at least we had some good food we fought tooth and nail to get a reservation for all of us sunday night at one of the restaurants on the resort after spending yet more of our vaction time arguing to get a reservation , we go to the restaurant and it is basically empty one night we lost our room key it took two calls from my mothers room and 1 hour to get a replacement key in our wedding party there were complaints of slow service to fix various things that were broken in all of the rooms the sheets smelled like cigarettes one persons room had no ac for two days the nice things were that it is visually a beautiful place the beach , the wild animals running around , the palm trees and coconuts everywhere the pool is nice and the bar is truly the only thing that is pretty much always open although the drinks are watered down 
sick in paradise a family group of four adults when to this resort in third week of november 2006 and were extremely sick from the food we were all very careful in our food selection choices , however we were all violently ill we spoke to other patrons from other countries and they also had become sick we do not know the exact cause as yet but we are seeking medical advice the grounds were meticulous and the weather was simply wonderful , however we spent the a great majority of our holiday time in the loo this was our second trip to the dominican republic and after this experience we will never be returning signed , stil feeling the effects winnipeg , manitoba 
overall the facilities were ok the rooms were nice , but where the trip went wrong was the food and service we were there with a wedding party , and more than half the people got sick from the food i 'm dominican and the food was a disaster , they did not cook anything good for breakfast lunch or dinner the snack place had something called a burger , but no could tell what it really was they messed up rice  beans , platano maduros ( they put maple syrup in them ) , just awful then to top it all off the service was really bad they have no professionalism , its a bunch of jokers and guys hitting on the girls in the wedding party at checkout or bill was incorrect and they did not even try to fix it they knew we had a plane to catch so they said they could not check us out until we paid the additional money the phone was chanrged a collect call when we werent in the room , and prices on services chnaged after we had used them ( message was $10 more than what we were told ) if the place was worth it , the additional money would not have been a big deal , but since the place was awful we really did not want to hear it i told the manager that this experience could cost him visitors and he did not care people stay somewhere else a friend told us that barcelo resorts was much better 
i??e been in 4 stars much better then gran oasis loved my second time in punta cana , but i wouldn?? go back again to grand oasis punta cana when my boyfriend and i made our check - in at the hotel we were told that we were getting a deluxe room , but if we had any problems with the room we could upgrade to a junior suite for an extra $50 a night that sounded strange? problems could a deluxe room have when we got to the room it had a very strong smell of moister , the bathtub seemed that it hadn?? been cleaned in a long time and the windows didn?? closed we complaint to the reception and they immediately showed us another room this second room had the same smell ( i couldn?? stay there because of my allergies ) and same problem with the windows the third room we visited looked ( and smelled ) much better , although it was clearly older them the previous 2, but we decided for that one when we took our first bath , we discovered that the bathtub had some kind of leak to the bathroom floor and we always had to use 1 towel to stop the leak luckily there was always an extra bath towel , although we only had one 1 hand towel the room?? balcony columns and walls were full of cracks and the handrail seemed to be falling ( we didn?? spend much time there enjoying the wonderful view to the beach ) the maids in our floor started to clean the rooms very early in the morning ( around 6:30 or 7:00am ) and never knocked before they enter we met another portuguese couple in the hotel that was staying in block 9 ??he honeymooner?? block? ( our first room was in block 6, we saw another in block 2 and the last one in 4) and their room was a completely different story they tolds they had a new and very clean room and their only problem was the moister smell in the first day and the lack of the tv remote for 2 days another big problem was the food? in the main restaurant ( ??indows? there was a large variety but everything tasted the same the salads and desserts were out of the cold ( even the ice cream ) and there were flies all over the food and tables one night we tried to go to the tex - mex restaurant but it was closed because the hotel was having a low season and they started closing the restaurants the alternative was the main one or the japanese that was not included ( had to pay $15 a person ) one day i got sick after eating at ??are? ( seafood restaurant ) we talked to the other portuguese couple , which went to ??are? the same night and the girl ordered the same food i did? she got sick too we couldn?? handle anything in our stomachs for a couple of days the hotel staff was always helpful and very friendly , but just the staff doesn?? make a 5 star hotel i 've just been to 3 different all inclusive hotels (2 of them 4 stars ) but this one was by far the worst 
would not go there again maid service was horrible , she did not come to clean the room until about 6pm everyday and never left clean towels , we had to complain and wait 1/2 hr to 1hr or more for some clean towels my sister in law waited a 1/2 hr in the hallway oneday for some toilet paper while my niece sat on the toilet maid never changed the sheets on the beds the whole time we were there everytime we went to get our beach towels they were always out of them no policy on beach chair reserving , for example i was traveling with small children and everytime we went to the pool there was never no lounge chairs available under the umbrellas , people had reserved them with their towels and left for hours , so a few days into the trip we started to montior how long it took people to come back to their chairs , one couple reserved the chairs first thing in the morning and came back at 5:30pm stayed for 10 min and left to go eat and never came back , another couple i saw reserved chairs by the pool and by the beach , stayed on the beach all day then came back to their lounge chairs by the pool for about 30 min , then left again to the beach never to return to the pool , mind you their towel was on the pool lounge chair all day , so we began complaining to the managers about the situation explaining to them that we are traveling with small children and we need an umbrella , and that people reserve the chairs and never use them , they basically told me oh well , theres nothing they can do so my sister in law woke up at 5am every morning from then on , grabbed towels and went to reserve chairs for our family and then went back to bed my 4 yr old had to use the bathroom when we were by the pool one day , so i rushed her to the nearest poolside restroom , there was only two stalls both toilets were clogged one with bo and the other with multiple tampons and urine , the bathroom stunk and was filthy , i ran out carrying the baby yelling for my husband to take her in the mens room , he came running out saying that one was filthy too , so he had to run her back to the hotel room one day we were eating in the buffet and my sister in law spotted a huge bug on the wall behind the bar , she told the waiter and he just laughed , everyone was skeeved , all of the sudden the bug flew from the wall across the bar and on to our table , we screamed it was a huge flying cockaroach , the wait staff tried to calm us down saying that they had the windows open today and it probably came in then bull crap a few days later i woke up in the middle of the night half asleep to use the bathroom , as i am using the bathroom something moving catches my eye , another huge flying cockaroach , i ran screaming almost giving my husband a heart attack again complaining to the managers and no one gave a crap the food was not all that , the best place to eat was the beach patio resturaunt ( ca not remember the name ) and that food was alright , all the liquor is watered down big time overall it really was not worth the money , i regret booking it , we go to a different country every year and this one was by far the worst trip before i booked this trip i checked book it and they gave it 4 1/2 stars , i checked a few other places i ca not remember and they all had given the hotel 4 stars , i dont know where they get their info from , i would not even give it 2 stars 
worst vacation ever we just returned from a week 's stay 7/11-7/18 at the globalia we are a family of four and my dad accompanied us the resort was well maintained and the staff was mostly considerate our room 's were in building 2 we had a problem with ants and the air condition did not work for the first three days we were there they finally resolved the problem for what it was worth the air never really gets that cool the beach is cluttered and we were disappointed in the water clarity also the swim area is small due to all of the boats surrounding the property it 's like swimming in a marina the food was awful this is my first day back to normalcy we have been ill for 9 days i got sick the fourth day we were there and remained sick until today four out of the five of us had severe diarrhea we have had 5 trips to the doctor 's since our return home and we were all treated with antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection we spoke to many other travelers who were also sick and disappointed we met another family on sunday that had just arrived on friday for a week 's stay and they left monday morning because they got sick the night before it 's not what we were accustomed to i would definitely go to mexico before i go here for us , it was the first and last trip

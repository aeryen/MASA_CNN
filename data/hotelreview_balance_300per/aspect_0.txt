we had the most wonderful time at the excellence we opted for the excellence club and it was well worht it for the perks roberto puello who was the club manager did an extra special job of making us feel welcomed we took some great pictures that looked like postcards the food was excellent the pizza was close to being our favorite the shows were great especially the michael jackson and the 70's  80's night the french resturant was probably our favorite we will definately be back for an anniversary trip we made some friends but had plenty of privcacy as well the rooms were great and everytime we left and came back it was cleaned , towels restocked and the bar was as well 
a truly fantastic place xmas  we have just returned from a 2 week xmas  new year break at the excellence punta cana the hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before the restaurants are great , with plenty of choice the whole complex is so good that we only did one trip and that was for my wife to swim with the dolphins great beaches and pools the staff fall over each other to look after you we stayed in a junior suite on ground level and it was spotlessly clean , great maid service and room service on tap 24/7 overall i would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in on holidayand i am extremely fussy the journey to the resort is a little uncomfortable , with the roads in a bad state but once you are checked in the pace of life slows down and you forget about the outside world worthy of special mention and our sincere thanks are : pedro from the cielo bar/pool an absolute gentleman miguel the bell boy and also carlos from the skay bar we will definately be booking again , probably for next christmas jim  eileen ( telford uk ) 
too sick to enjoy the ride to and form the airport is not good very bumpy road and you can really see the poor living conditions when you get to the resort it is like another world we were told not to drink the tap or shower water - keep your mouth shut in the shower etc but we have since heard that not all properties in punta cana have a water problem in some resorts they have a huge purification system and the tap water is safe both my husband and i were sick with diarrhea while we were there and put it down to the unclean water used to prepare food we will not go on any more holidays where we have to worry about our health each night at about 10pm when we were settling down to sleep the music started up and we like fresh air but we had to close our patio doors to mute the sound we really wanted a quieter resort it was disappointing it was partially our fault for not doing our research properly some people did not hear the bands play at night but we couldnt change our swim up room for a quieter one we will not be returning to dominican republic 
relaxing and fun , but i rang in the new year at excellence punta cana since new york was freezing at the time , i was just happy to be in the sun my husband and i had a great time overall however , i was a little surprised to see this hotel rating itself as a 5- star facility ( more like a 4) all of the basics were covered , but some of the details that i would expect from a 5- star place were missing the bed , although comfortable creaked loudly and i couldn?? tell whether or not the headboard was attached properly the staff were friendly and helpful overall , but in keeping up with the island mentality , their sense of urgency was lacking ( we had to ask two different people for hand towels and our one small room service order took close to an hour to arrive ) actually , as mentioned by another reviewer , the food was the worst part the presentation was excellent ( clean buffet areas , nicely decorated theme restaurants ) , but the dinner food quality wasn?? the best one night i didn?? even finish my meal ( at the ??exican? on - site ) lunch ( indoor buffet or beach bbq ) was usually the best bet actually , everything on the beach ??ncluding the wait staff??as great considering all of this , the excellence was a great setting for relaxation the grounds were beautiful , the weather was pleasant and there were many options for activities ( and spa treatments ) if you wanted them i would definitely go back one note - coordinate travel to and from the hotel beforehand if you can the hotel is over an hour away from the airport , so you 'll want to skip the can i help you , sir bidding wars between different transportation companies one more note - the resort is on the atlantic side of the ocean that means rough seas and cold ( er ) water if you intend to spend your entire vacation in the ocean , you may want to skip this place i went in a few times , but i quickly became content just relaxing by the water when i couldn?? go in it 
somewhat excellence we just returned from a one week stay at excellence punta cana from dec27th to jan4th we are seasoned travelers and have stayed at a dozen all inclusives we stayed at excellence punta cana in 2007 for two weeks , then excellence mayan riviera and then playa mujeres and now just returned from our second time to punta cana we love excellence so here goes the staff at excellence i rate 5 star all the way they are an amazing group of people friendly hard working and makes your stay wonderful pool beach and grounds a solid five star ca not say more then wow now for the rooms we traveled as three couples all oceanview excellence club seen all three rooms and they are all in need of work the rooms are showing there age all over the place a 4 rating is generous food a 3 rating very incosistent cold most of the time under cooked over cooked , the new ala carte menus has less selection and was not impressed at all deffinately a great decline since our last trip two years ago excellence club we did it in 2007 and that is why we all choose to do it again i rate it a three the only thing good was the view and the ability for late check out as we had a late flight home but for its service i rate it a 3 excellence club was closed upon our late arrival so they gave us our keys and sent us on our way in pitch darkness we knew where we where going so we led the other two couples we traveled with too their rooms their service was very inconsistent beach towels in all of our three club rooms only once went to excellence club three times for a channel changer in the end tipped staff and they got one from an unoccupied room turn down hit and miss had to ask for bathroom amenities , would not exchange any liquor bottles in room which they did the first time we where there the club lounge it self which used to have plenty of food to choose from literally had nothing during the day and evening cheese some fruit and bread not at all like it was excellence club has deteriated there service big time the staff tended better to you then excellence club staff we requested top floor for all three rooms and after all our returns we thought that was not an unreasonable request and we did not get one top floor room save your money and shame on you excellence club for your lack of service all three rooms had very inconsistne fridge stalking and was only resolved with a tip and even then once when givin a tip was not done i will not be returning to excellence punta cana and it is sliding down the charts for a reason in saying all this we traveled with two other couples and we all had a fabulous time we just feel we did not get what we pated for anyone with questions please do not hesitate to contact me 
beautiful resort but be careful of a few things my husband and i just got back from a one - week trip to this resort our vacation did not start well this hotel overbooks the nicest rooms when we arrived they immediately downgraded us b/c they did not have the room we booked available there was also an issue of miscommunication b/w our travel agent and the hotel and the hotel staff was totally unhelpful in resolving the issue we had to do all of the legwork ourselves at one point the concierge told us they could not phone our travel agency b/c that phone call would cost $ that 's customer service once all was resolved and we were in our proper room , the trip was wonderful the property is gorgeous and well maintained there are lots of restaurants to choose from and the food was as good or better than anything we 've had in the carribean apart from the front desk staff , all of the other employees are very friendly and helpful booking the excellence club is worth it - just make sure the documents you get back from your travel agency clearly state that your booking includes the club 
a varied but good experience we choose excellence due to their very good reviews some broad observations on what have said distance - yes it 's a good hour from the airport we enjoyed the ride through the countryside and small towns you 're going to be in a bubble at an all - inclusive anyway why not see some of the real island on the way rooms - we lucked out requested and got a ground floor corner non - smoking room we also got a partial ocean view and strong sounds of the surf semi private patio with a single hammock after walking around we saw how lucky we were the majority of the rooms overlook a small interior garden or the grounds - no pool or ocean locations the bed was very hard the room was large and comfortable , but had problems with the toilet - dripped the shower was small - average size nice marble walls , plastic floor , drop ceiling with acoustic tile the room had crown moulding usually a very nice touch theirs was thin and in bad need of a paint job the jacuzzi tub was fun , but the jets were not very powerful or well placed the tv got a good number of stations , but the vcr did not work - not a big deal for us the restaurant service was very good and very fun at each restaurant , the hostess escort the women , by the arm , to your table their house wine , chard , savanion blanc , cab , and merlot were all quite good the food itself was mixed an example was the mediterranean restaurant my wife had to send back the kibbe ( she lived in the middle east for 6 years and knows what the food really tastes like on the flip side , the pear/goat cheese salad was spot on all the portions are small , but the dinners - 3-4 courses served over a hour 's time - filled us up by the end the plating was all very well done beach - hard surf , sand colored sand that is very fine surf was very good for body surfing , but not good for bobbing spa - they push it it 's how they make their money we did a free 1 hour hot tub tour they do to get guests to buy massages , etc frankly , i thought the building left a bit to be desired compared to other resorts - notably ibrostar - theirs was not much to write home about very nice , yes but certainly not world - class architecture we did not take any treatments , so ca not comment about them overall - these resorts , like other vacations and like life in general - is what you make it we went to relax , to be pampered , to have a good time and we did we found the people - both in and out of the resort - to be extremely pleasant and proud of their island all the staff were joy to interact with because we would want to try other places and islands , not because we had a bad time we would recommend it to others just realize that 5 star in the dr is not what 5 star in a western country would be 
my husband and i stayed here for six days on our honeymoon it was the most incredible resort the rooms were comfortable and lovely , and the service was impeccable we were so impressed we are looking into the other excellence resorts for our next vacation we loved that it was all - inclusive get hungry at 3 am no problem , just call room service the restaurants were impressive , and the bars were really nice everything about the resort was visually appealing , clean , and luxurious there were all sorts of things to do , also we went horseback riding , spent a day in the spa ( amazing ) , saw a circus and a magic show , and walked through the botanical garden , all within the resort most other places ( marinarium , bavaro tours ) will pick you up right in front of the lobby if you want to do activities outside the resort i definitely would not rent a car , though , unless you are comfortable driving amongst maniacs seriously , though , if you are looking for a place to get away from everything , excellence at punta cana is the perfect choice our honeymoon could not have been better 
they do not honor your reservations for starters , liberty travel dropped the ball , failed to tell us that if we flew in to santa domingo airport we would be facing a 4 -5 hour horrible ride over unpaved roads , since it was not the closest airport the airport that is closest to excellence is the punta cana airport we had to spend big $ to switch airports and airlines for our departure next , because we arrived so late , thanks to the long ride from the wrong airport , we were told that the room we paid for , which was partial oceanview , could not be honored , as they only had a courtyard/palm tree view available depressed and discouraged , we sucked it up until the next day , when they moved us to another courtyard/palm - tree room as a compensation for this 5 day disaster , we were offered and accepted a dinner at the beach , even though all meals were paid for and inclusive they actually told liberty travel that they felt that this was adequate compensation in addition , the air conditioning in both rooms was not adequate , and sleeping was difficult the first room had plumbing problems when the toilet did not flush properly , and began to overflow , we called the plumber at 3 am he kept us up for about an hour , working inside and outside the room when we never heard from him again , we called the front desk , and told them not to send him back in , and that we would also deal with that problem on our own personally , i would never go back to the dominican republic if i wanted an excellent vacation it 's still way too 3rd world , and has a lot of catching up to do do not try to use the river pool only a couple of brave souls entered in to it , since it was freezing spend a few more dollars , and go to aruba 
still great , afer 3 visits we love everything about the place maybe we 've been lucky as we 've never had any problems with anything all of the staff and activity people are super marosal , juan , juan carlos , cesar are a few of the names i remember but they are all unbelievable the drive is one hour from the airport and is not too bad the restaurants and the staff are terrific domingo the sax player is a real world - class musician and a must see and hear part of the package , his versions of brazil , the girl from ipanema and besame mucho are unique and beautiful as well are his other songs we met a lot of wonderful people from around the world my wife and i enjoyed the food and drinks , we 've been to a few other places over the years and excellence is the best place we 've been to charles and nancy lubanski 
excellence blew me away spent five nights at the excellence punta cana from december 21-26 2008 my only previous all inclusive stay in the dominican was at the bavaro princess , and let me say , there really is no comparison from the moment you arrive from the airport , you can sense the decadence the resort grounds are in perfect shape , and the smaller size - at least by mega resort standards - makes getting around the resort simple we were in room 3101, and quickly realized that upgrading to an excellence club , swim up , or ocean view room really is not needed that said , while spending most of our time at the cascade pool , we figured on a return trip a swim up room would be a nice indulgence the rooms are spacious and beautiful the minibar was stocked daily and very cold the bed was firm as indicated in prior reviews , but that 's exactly how i like it we spent most days at the cascade pool , which is nice and has a secluded feeling never a problem getting a chair , towel or floatee the beach was nice , and the waves made boogie boarding quite fun and let me say , the absence of kids makes enjoying the pool and the beach that much easier on to the food what better way to start each morning than room service breakfast in bed it was great not having to head down to the buffet in the morning the room service was quick and tasty , and whenever i asked if i could customize my breakfast , the answer was , of course now , i know that lots of people fret about the food in these resorts let me say , we loved it here is a quick synopsis of the food we tried : the grill : perhaps our favourite ate the grilled mahi mahi and the mahi mahi baguette for lunch most days , and instantly looked forward to it the next day perfect spot for lunch spice : tried the grouper fillet on night one ( a little salty ) and the shrimp pad thai nothing like the pad thai we have at home , but delicious nonetheless the seafood soup appetizer is also great , but i would skip the sushi next time around toscana : very nice for dinner , but the lunch buffet was not my thing i prefer to stay away from buffets whenever possible chez isabelle : wow you really feel like you are in a 5* restaurant here i had the nicoise salad and the sea bass , and it was incredible lobster house : as others have pointed out , a bit of a letdown not bad , but not great either as for the drinks , the selection of wine is impressive , and as all have said , the coco locos , served in a fresh coconut , are something i will be dreaming about for a while we met several couples that have been going to the epc for years and it is easy to see why after our trip to the bavaro princess we were eager to see what other resorts have to offer - that curiosity is now gone - all future trips to the dominican will be for return visits to the excellence punta cana - a true first class resort 
best hotel in the dominican it was our 4th time to the domincan , this hotel was by far a superior class resort : a very private resort where noise is kept to a minimum as it is chidren free and geared towards adults plently of places to relax so it is not over - crowded there were lots of different seating ranging from loungers to four poster beds both on the beach and around the pool , with plently of towels the reception is large and spacious and very comfortable the reception staff are very helpful , especially charismatic edwin the unique design of the resort means that you do not get wet walking from the rooms to the restaurants during the tropical showers rooms : there was a 4 poster bed , luxury furnishings and it was very comfortable well maintained and clean it was a spacious room with good seperate shower dvd players in the room the tv channels are limited and very geared towards the us market , no english footie or news facilities : there is waiter service wherever you lay your hat they will take drinks orders as well as deliver pizza on the beach there are 8 restaurants for the evening dinners to satisfy most taste buds if you have any special food requirements e vegetarian , see ramon , manager of barcelona restaurant , he will make anything for you ( thank you ramon , you made our holiday ) the head chef , mr dettweitler is world renown and ensures that all of the food is of the highest quality , they are very lucky to have him there the breakfast and lunch buffets are fantastic offering a large choice of food felix the manager of the toscana is very polite and helpful the gym is the most modern we have ever seen in a hotel with state of the art equipment and it is well maintained general : they create a very comfortable atmosphere and nobody violates your space in any way , but they are always there if you need them it is a very easy place to settle in to go for it , you will not be disappointed mr and mrs dhillon 
our trip our trip to the dominican republic was okay we stayed at the excellence resort it would have been excellent if we did not have so many problems getting the service that we paid for when we called to get something fixed like the leaking ceiling or the toliet that stopped working , it took forever numerous times there was not any towels for the next day or the mini bar was not restocked with the things that we liked the thing that saved the trip was the entertainment staff they were always smiling and asking if you were having a good time they got you involved in the activities that were going on like dancing and spanish lessons also , they had really good shows that were funny and entertaining juan carlos , cesar and all the girls there were excellent i think that it is very beautiful and relaxing there but i would definately let my friends know about the advantages and disadvantages of my trip and let them decide of they would want to go 
peace , quiet , and good food we spent a week at the excellence punta cana - our fifth visit to the d this is the best hotel we have found so far rooms are the usual junior suites , well - supplied the pool is great staff were friendly and helpful the beach is wide surf was a bit rough ( we did have some rain each day - not enough to make us stay inside ) but there were calm areas too the big difference was the food - the best we have eaten in the caribbean so far you can avoid a buffet for all three meals if you prefer and there are no dinner buffets at all this is a big plus the food is nicely prepared and presented our one complaint was sand fleas , but this likely had more to do with the weather than anything else we will consider a return to the excellence for certain because we went a bit before high season began , we enjoyed peace and quiet - a lovely rest - and of course the good food 
ca not wait to go back we had the best time at excellence my wife and i went there for our honeymoon for a week long stay from 11/09-11/16 we never thought we would be the type to return to a place because we love to travel all over , but we have decided to return to excellence punta cana for one or more of our anniversaries first of all , the resort , beach and surroundings are all beautiful it was truly like being immersed in a paradise our room was a deluxe garden view on the first floor and we experienced no problems with the room it had it 's own little patio and private hammock after reading many reviews before arriving we were very suprised at how harsh people can critize the most miniscule imperfections we read that quite a few people complained that the air conditioning would not work unless the patio door was latched that 's your complaint the food also gets a bad rap , but is actually quite good the fact that there is so much of a variety and that it is all inclusive really makes it easy to find something that is tasty the breakfast buffet was great it was such a huge spread our favorite meal however , was at the beach party the staff set up a beautiful area and prepared a bunch of traditional dominican food it was events like these that we enjoyed so much we 'd like to thank the entertainment staff for all that they did hooray for cesar , santo , eliza , mariel , and ines they worked the whole day specifically to make sure everyone had a great time and we enjoyed their company and enthusiasm it was great that each night , we would have a schedule slipped under the door for the upcoming day we could plan our day around a lot of fun activities : beach volleyball , pool volleyball , beach olympics , dancing lessons , etc this schedule also gives you a lot of important info like the restaurant schedule and the show at night we ended up seeing the show almost every night the michael jackson show was the best and the circus show was impressive as well based on our experiences i 'd like to offer some suggestions :1 try all the drinks our favorites were the dirty banana , the coco loco and the sammy sosa if you know spanish , use as much as you can it really goes a long way with the staff tips are not expected but are certainly appreciated a couple bucks to the maids ensures that your room will be taken care of nicely , with a few suprises even one night we returned from the show , to have a bubble bath drawn with rose petals , and candles everywhere we could not believe how nasty some other guests are to the staff while these workers bust there butts all day if you are nice to the staff , you will get great service we did purchase one excursion a boat trip swimming with sharks and sting rays it was pretty touristy , but pretty fun a non - resort excursion is not necessary there 's plenty to do if you stay on the property just outside the property , vendors set up and and are pretty ruthless it 's not to hard to get past them , ignoring them seems to be the best bet take the complaints in other reviews with a grain of salt we 've traveled all over through europe , japan , thailand and more , but excellence has been the best by far have fun , jake and heather 
great pool the best restaurants would be chez isabelle , agave , spice and the grill the rooms were nice the pool spans across the resort and everything is within close walking distance the entertainment was fun and above average compared to any other resort i 've been to the best excursions would be 4wheeling and macao beach saona island is nice too if you want to buy souvenirs , walk left to the resort to go to nancy 's she 's very friendly and her prices are reasonable the water is a bit rough if you expect to swim in it 
great adults only resort this is a great place for a couple to spend quality time together the grounds and acommodations are excelente we found the food somewhat inconsistent through out the 8 restaurants good were chez isabelle ( french ) , the grill ( meats ) , agave ( mexican ) and spice ( asian ) others not bad , but not so good breakfast and lunches were very good to excellent the people there are very friendly and willing to help in most cases found pool and beach service quality somewhat sporadic they sometimes forget to bring you what you order overall service was very good we found the entertainment to be enjoyable every night we love to dance , but found the dj at the disco to play stuff he liked instead of what the guests could dance to we still enjoyed the music we will not hesitate to go back , and will probably do so next year 
romantic getaway dec 2008 my boyfriend and i stayed at excellence from dec 6-13th we called to confirm our reservation a week before our trip and when we were asked if we were celebrating any special occasion , my boyfriend said it was our anniversary ( not a complete lie , our anniversary was two months ago lol ) i 'd recommend doing this because we got champagne when we arrived , a romantic dinner at one of the restaurants with rose petals on the table and a bottle of champagne , a jacuzzi filled with bubbles and flower petals one night after returning to our room , 15% off at the spa , etc just a lot of romantic extras that i do not believe the average person gets we arranged a private taxi through the hotel to pick us up , and as soon as we got in the car , the driver took out a cooler with ice cold beers inside for us that was a great first impression we relaxed for our 1 hour ride to the hotel , the roads are bad yes , but nothing that should deter you from going on the trip the service was amazing everywhere the staff really is wonderful they serve you pizzas on the beach and by the pool every day , have cookouts on the beach , the drinks keep flowing all day , they even refill your glasses at the restaurants before they 're even empty our room was perfect ( room 11209) it had a vaulted ceiling because it was on the third floor , and a beautiful garden view the maids were great , they mop every day since we track in a lot of sand , etc we tipped them $2 a day and then $5 the last day i did get sick about our third day there , not really sure from what , but we brought ammodium so it was under control , but the next two or three days i could not eat much was a little nauseous and worried about getting worse the food is my only complaint really it 's not bad but i just thought it would be better since everything else there is so perfect i 'm sure you 'll find something you like at every restaurant , but i 'd say it 's just average it would be the only reason i 'd think twice about going back , but mostly because i got sick , not because of the food itself we did the free horseback riding on the beach ( kinda scary as my horse was slow and clumsy and they kept whipping him to go faster which scared me lol i was a first time rider and kept thinking i was going to fall off ) we also did the ziplining excursion which we loved highly recommend it was not as scary as i thought it would be we also did saona island which was nice , we had some rain on and off though but overall not bad the island was very pretty and the food they served there was pretty good the beach is not as bad as they say it is you ca not swim around alot but it 's fun to play in the waves and the water it a beautiful color it 's true that if you walk to the right around the corner you 'll find calmer water where you can swim with no waves too sandy for snorkeling though , but it was very nice and a little secluded we only went to nancy at the shops on the beach she 's so nice and her english is perfect ( she seems americanized ) and she lets you browse on your own , which is a nice change from being followed and harrassed to buy things we bought a bottle of rum , 3 cigars , a bathing suit wrap , kids tshirt , small framed painting and prob one or two other things i ca not think of all for $55 they do not negotiate their prices there , but was not really a problem because they were fair to begin with we found a jacuzzi one night by the pool with a tray next to it with flowers and a bottle of champagne we asked someone if it had been reserved and they said no that 's for anyone it was those little details like that that really go to me it is such a beautiful and romantic place i would definately recommend it , as long as you 're not too picky an eater , and you bring some ammodium or pepto domingo , the sax player , plays so beautifully really helps set the romantic mood the shows were hit or miss the perfect couple and the circus were both great chris blizzard and the magic show put us to sleep a little , and we missed the michael jackson show but heard from other people who saw it that it was very good we heard the club was corny so we did not go there , we were back at the room by 11-12 everynight anyway since we were tired from the long day we paid extra for the dinner on the beach , which is well worth the money it was so romantic , and the food was the best we had all week the first few nights i did not get bitten so i did not wear the bug spray i brought but then i did get 5-10 mosquito bites on my legs the second half of the week so i 'd recommend wearing the spray i 'd give the resort 4 5 stars and the food 3 stars feel free to write me with any questions 
excellence is excellente all i gotta say is this was the most amazing trip ive ever had in my life the staff there is so sweet and the cleanest hotel u have ever seen , and not to mention the food wow , amazing , , im planning my next trip there again 
turk , i 'm dominican will add photos later but we ate everywhere except oregano , agave , the grill and the lobster house ate at spice twice and everything we got was delicious greek salad was superb at toscana for lunch and at the med food for dinner everything was excellent room service was just average the three milk cake is a hidden gem on that menu room service menus listed beverages they would not bring a couple of days we opted not to have our mini fridge filled and room service did not want to bring any drinks except breakfast time we used room service a lot and pretty much always had our meals within thirty minutes but always definately under an hour and near their estimated time loved the beach pizza that 's what i called the pizza they bring around the pools around 1 every day everything was so nice and clean and the hotel is the perfect size and makes the grounds easily accessible everything is very well kept everyone always has a smile to offer the mattress is firm but i loved it the tub was amazing our jets were broke the first night and we told the front desk when we got in it the third night we fully expected them to still not work from reading reviews but they did so they had been fixed immediately after reporting a problem the maidservice is fantastic overall we did not get service twice a day every day and this was a little disappointing but everything was cleaned well every day and she was always polite a little spanish will get you a long way when communicating needs the rooms are very spacious and i loved all the little attention to details our room did have dvd player in it in case you want to bring a couple movies , which might be a good idea for bad weather yes , go right for calmer ocean and seclusion overall very rough waves though not the blue you might expect from carribean loved the beds the excellence club area has the best ones the main looks amazing it goes on forever and looks so much fun but we were cascade pool folk and it was a more intimate one where you were bound to see the same people throughout the week they are all very well kept and clean never a problem with rafts towels are not usually a problem til afternoon but most people seemed to have one by then anyway everything we saw was great and fun if you want to have fun , you can we did not do any of the activities if you said just casually that you wanted something and it was at all in the power of the person whom you were speaking with 's ability to get it for you they would run ( often literally ) to go get it for you this happed to us on numerous occasions the staff seem to sincerely want you to have the best vacation you 've ever had the dominican people are so hospitable and generous and sweet they truly made it a pleasureable destination they made the trip every second in everything they did also , tipping it is never expected but always appreciated yes , we got sick not til the 5th day though my husband had a fever of 101-104 for about 18 hours before we went to the hospital ( about 50 minutes away ) always buy travel insurance if you have any questions about our medical care at the hotel or hospital feel free to pm me but he did get diahrea as well and me too but after still being sick a week after i got back i went to the doctor here and my labs were fine mine was probably stress and the meds they gave him cleared him up but it should probably be mentioned he got sick there drinks were all amazing loved me some sol dominicanos it is definately not necessary to know spanish , but it might be helpful to learn a little if you would have to go from the resort at all it is helpful i would advise learning a little but not necessary thanks to past traveler recommending power strip i would bring an old sheet for the beach/pool beds on the chance you do not get a towel you can lay that down instead for both of you also , it 's good to lay down anyway if you have towels also , know that if you do go to the vendors on the beach be careful what you say/do just saying i liked a painting got us in an uncomfortable situation with a lot of pressure to spend money we literally did not have with us if you are thinking about it at all , go i think we might have had a worst - case type of scenario and i 'm still recommending it it was paradise for the couple wanting to just get away together thanks again to all the staff and friends we made 
i stayed at the excellence punta cana with my mother it was a beautiful place mostly couples , but it was fine for the 2 of us as well all the staff was wonderful and so accomodating they offered a free 1/2 hour horse back ride on the beach which was awesome the food was delicious the dancers , especially cesar , were wonderful he even showed us how to salsa it was such a wonderful trip i may even go back for my honeymoon 
signs of aging but full of beauty and surprises overall ( my rating : 8 of 10) the excellence punta cana : like a mature lover , showing signs of age , but full of beautiful experience and surprises this is an excellent ( no pun intended ) resort there are several areas in need of refurbishment however , the activities are plentiful , the staff is extraordinarily gracious , the food ( in some restaurants ) was superb , and the pool was so fabulous that even this workaholic found himself relaxing in no time backgroundmy wife and i spent our wedding anniversary at the excellence punta cana from saturday , november 29 through friday , december 5 we were looking for an all - inclusive island getaway beau nanni at the road less travelled suggested that because it was an anniversary vacation that we consider the adults - only excellence punta cana we finalized our decision only after reading the traveler reviews here at tripadvisor and being pleased with the quoted price relative to most all - inclusive of a similar nature airport transferprieto tours managed our transportation to and from the excellence the ride to and from the resort takes approximately 75-85 minutes the roads in punta cana range from three - car - lengths wide , paved , and lined ( near the airport ) to one - car - length wide , unpaved , and unlined our driver slowed down considerably and coasted slowly over the divots and rocky patches for those with motion sickness or anxiety , i might suggest an antiemetic ( e , bonine/dramamine ) i had taken something anyway ( because of the flight ) so i found the ride from the airport to be more psychologically jarring ( relative to suburban american infrastructure ) than physically jarring weatherthe weather was perfect with the low never falling below 72f/22c and the high never climbing above 85f/29c there were brief sunrise showers on 3 of 7 mornings and a brief evening shower on 2 of 7 nights aside from that , the humidity was moderate and the breeze off the ocean was delightful particularly during the sunny early afternoons when sunbathing mosquitoes were not an issue during our stay however , your experience may differ and i would suggest coming prepared with at least 1 small (1 fl oz or 30 ml ) bottle per person of 100% deet per person per week accommodations ( my rating : 7 of 10) we had an ocean view from our excellence club building 10 second floor room our view of the ocean was good , but not spectacular as the rooms are not actually that close to the ocean the main pool and palm tree foliage sat between our room and the ocean however , after reviewing the layout of the hotel , i surmise that our ocean view was probably one of the best our room had a beautiful ancient indigenous design , spacious , and comfortable other reviewers noted an ant and mosquito problem we had no flying insects in our room we did notice approximately 0-2 ants per day on the bathroom floor nothing of concern the room furniture was adequate and the safe was large ( not laptop large but 2 portable dvd players large ) the balcony furniture was a nice luxury especially in the early morning and the evening our balcony screen door was broken upon our arrival , they fixed it within hours of my calling down housekeeping ( my rating : 4 of 10) the minibar was stocked and restocked daily one day i left a note and a tip with a special request that was granted with friendly reply note daily room cleaning was inconsistent with regard to timing and quality there was more than one occasion when i had to call down for an extra face cloth or towel to be delivered during the evening turn down service beach ( my rating : 6 of 10) soft luxurious sand , plenty of beach chairs , special cabanas ( if you could get their early ) , beautiful water and big waves it is an idyllic beach for watching the tide roll in and reading a book , but the waves were too strong and too big for any swimming or deep frolicking do not go too far pass the end of the resort on the side furthest from the lobby once you go 100 meters past nancy 's market , you 're on your own because there are no more resorts or hotel on the beach in that direction for miles if you want to explore the beach beyond the excellence go the other direction ( past the excursions/water sports hut ) main swimming pool ( my rating : 10 of 10) there are two pools , but i only spent time at the main pool the main pool is in a word fun there are three bars between the plaza/ beginning of the pool and the end of the pool there are plenty of beach chairs , two - person cabanas , and floating mats with drink holders the water was fine , but i spent most of my time by the pool reading , resting , and taking full advantage of the pool waiter service someone came by to ask if i wanted a drink at least once every 60 minutes and between 1 pm and 3:30 pm , there is a waiter who walks around with hot pizza delivery if they had someone from 9am - 11 am delivering donuts , i would have been in heaven activities and entertainment ( my rating : 8 of 10) daily : bike tours , horseback riding ( free 30 min per guest per stay ) , yoga , aerobics , spanish lessons , diving lessons , volleyball , water polo , and more nightly : live music , shows , theme dance partiessuggested highlights : saxophone player , featured music and dance performances ( e , rewind 70s and 80s and michael jackson shows ) the michael jackson show is silly ( especially the pre - show ) and the song selection is weak largely because dangerous is simply jam and smooth criminal remixed together and since they feature all three songs it feels monotonous but aside from that the michael jackson show is too kitschy to miss spa , gym , and sports ( my rating : 8 of 10) the spa ( located between the mini market and the disco ) is around the corner from the gym , tennis courts , basketball court , shooting range , archery range , and sports bar with billiard tables , foosball , darts , and ping pong my wife partook of the spa on several occasions and was very impressed with the facility there are different spa specials every day you can find the spa specials list at the spa pick up a price list and the weekly specials list on day one so you can plan ahead your spa bookings the gym has state - of - the - art new equipment , full nautilus , free - weights , four treadmills , and several bikes and step - machines the music is pumping , the closed captioning is on the televisions and there is a personal trainer there available for many of the prime hours during the day the gym is spacious , well - kept , staffed , and smells wonderful ( which is unusual for a gym ) i love working out and i loved that gym the tennis courts (2 caliche - clay and 1 hard ) and basketball court are in excellent shape however , the other sport facilities were in various states of disrepair one ping - pong table was good and the other was miserable one pool - table was okay and the other was miserable the upkeep of the sports and activity facilities , tables and equipment around the sports bar are in desperate need of renovations the best surprise of the trip for me was the tennis facility and rolando , the tennis pro i play tennis regularly and have played ( albeit poorly ) in local leagues i have received tennis instructor from at least 6 different instructors in my life time rolando was by far the best ( even with the language difference ) rolando was 1/3 the cost of private 1 hour lessons in my area ( however i live in a wealthy suburb between new york and philadelphia ) and was better then all of them i learned more and had more fun working with rolando in three days than i have with any instruction i 've had in the last three years if you play tennis and want to hit with a pro while you 're there , find rolando , and he has the newest top of the line prince racquets for you to borrow food ( my rating : 7 of 10) barcelona ( mediterranean/spanish ) , chez isabelle ( french ) , the agave ( mexican ) , toscano ( finer italian ) , spice ( chinese/japanese/thai ) , lobster house ( just lobster ) , the grill ( steakhouse ) , oregano ( common italian - pizza and pasta ) you know they take their service seriously when you see the staff line up at 6 am for instructions tastes vary and with that caveat the agave was excellent mexican fare in a quiet understated environment try the tres leche you wo not be disappointed spice has the most fabulous decor and wonderful asian dining choices 
excellence high standards as usual my wife and i stayed at epc for 14 nights from 17 november to 01 december 2008 we had a pool view room in building 2 on the first floor , overlooking the 2 pools with cascade waterfall other reviews of this hotel have provided all the information which people should need to assist in their choice , so the purpose of this review is to provide some personal thoughts and impressions about the resort and how we found it for our tastes we also include some notes of comparison with the two mexico excellence resorts which are very similar , but more modern i have added , at the end , some notes about punta cana airport for those who are traveling to the dominican republic for the first time the transfer to and from the airport took about 75 minutes in both directions we were transported by vip travel and the vehicles were modern , clean and air conditioned it was unfortunate that on arrival , a group of 8 people who were scheduled to travel on our minibus , didn?? turn up and we waited an hour before being transferred to another bus the roads in dominican republic leave a lot to be desired , with some sections having serious damage to the tarmac and many potholes but there is only one short section which is really bad and the drivers know how to avoid the worst bumps there were signs of this bad section being repaired and there is also evidence of a new road being built alongside , although i wouldn?? hold your breath for when it might be completed there is an alternative of a transfer by helicopter which costs ( i believe ) around us$75 per person each way your luggage must travel separately and meet you at the hotel our room ? was a good size , clean and with a very large , comfortable 4- poster bed the bathroom was fine and a good size , but we did miss the separate basins ( sinks ) ? in mexico we had his and hers basins also the shower , whilst fine and with plenty of power , was not as good as the walk - in showers in the mexico resorts but that?? just being a bit picky??? we had swim - up room at both mexico resorts and the rooms there were larger and with a better balcony / patio and private grass area and a second outside jacuzzi having looked at the swim - up rooms at punta cana , we would not bother to pay the extra for one here the resort is , as always with excellence , beautifully furnished and maintained and the gardens are manicured to perfection epc has an advantage of being longer established than the mexico resorts , so the gardens are more mature and the trees and shrubs are larger for us , the outstanding feature of this resort is the beach we are not beach people , but this has converted us ( as long as we can find this quality ) the sand is golden , soft , fine and clean ( unlike mexico ) the sea is warm , clean and had wonderful waves for jumping in this is not a swimming beach ? if you want to swim in calm water , you need to walk a couple of hundred yards to the right ( when looking out to sea ) where the reef is further out and the waves are broken before they reach the shore there is a system of warning flags for those wishing to go in the water there are one or two life guards on duty all day and they are very observant and attentive there is a black flag at each end of the patrolled area and when the sea is rougher they prefer people to stay together in the centre when red flags are flying people can go in the water with care , but non swimmers should stay fairly shallow , because the waves are strong and there is quite an undertow when the water flows in and out we had red flags every day except 2 stormy days when we had black flags and swimming was not allowed people were in the water on all except black flag days it was great fun if you like sea bathing the beach is raked every morning and there are plenty of sunloungers under palm trees and palapas there are frequent visits from staff taking orders for drinks and at lunchtime a guy comes around the beach ( and pool area ) offering pizzas in addition in good weather there is a ??ook out? on the beach ? of paella , or a dominican dish , or a barbeque in addition packs of sandwiches can be obtained from sol bar and don?? forget the soft ice cream dispenser around the side of kaf? caf? bar??? so much choice??? the pool areas are kept very clean and the pools are beautiful there are plenty of sun loungers , the swim - up bar and sol bar provided excellent service there are 2 separate pools surrounded by buildings 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 they tend to be quieter ? partly because there is less shade in that area there is a small ??ibrary? english language and other language books in the clubhouse at the back of the beach and in the sports bar ( also , we believe in the excellence club ) there are several gift and souvenir shops and a pharmacy outside the front entrance near to the attractive nature walk area we should add that all staff in this resort are friendly , smiling and helpful on the few occasions when problems occurred , we heard that they were dealt with promptly and efficiently the restaurants are very similar in all 3 resorts and as usual there was a dinner choice from at least six out of the eight possible restaurants every evening on only two occasions did we have to wait for a table ? they provide a ??leeper? carry with you whilst you are at the bar we ate in chez isabelle ( french ) , spice ( asian / japanese ) , toscana ( italian ) , barcelona ( mediterranean ) , the grill ( steaks ) and the lobster house ( self explanatory ) our favourite was the french with the japanese a close second the only disappointment was the lobster house ? but that was because we just don?? happen to like caribbean lobster , having previously been spoiled by atlantic lobster ( as found in new england ) we did not try the mexican restaurant ( agave ) , nor the pizza /pasta restaurant , although we heard good reports of the former most evenings there was an alternative barbeque offered on the plaza outside the theatre lunch restaurants were at an amazing buffet in toscana , or at the grill where the food is from a menu and served to the table breakfast is from another outstanding buffet in toscana or with service in the lobster house ( not a lobster menu there are 7 bars ( from memory ) all offering a good range of quality alcohols and soft drinks our main difficulty was that there is no peaceful bar in the evening the four open bars are all around the theatre area and are swamped by the extremely loud music from the entertainment , making conversation difficult or impossible the sports bar has a large screen tv so that is not a quiet haven either some shows may not appeal to your taste and for those staying longer than 7 days , you may not wish to see the weekly cycle a second time anyway it would be good to be able to retreat to a quiet place with new friends and have a conversation although some of the entertainment was ok for us ( it must be impossible to cater for all tastes ) it was regrettable that the comp?re?? many announcements and all music were played at such a high volume we thought for a while that there must have been a convention of people who are hard of hearing??? apart from the main shows there is an excellent saxophonist who plays very well , but still finds it necessary to play directly into a microphone and through huge speakers , thus destroying the subtlety of his music similarly the music played outside on the plaza in some early evenings ? but at least the sound is muted in the open air we did wander down to the disco one evening and enjoyed the night club atmosphere and some dancing now in a location like that , loud music is permitted if not essential by comparison , both the excellence resorts in mexico have a quieter bar area where one can avoid the entertainment if wished 
a relaxing vacation we visited during the period 23-29 november this was our fifth caribbean all inclusive , and it certainly offered more variety inside the resort than previously experienced on our other all inclusive vacations we booked in july through vacationstogo online , and they took care of everything quite nicely punta cana ground transportation was handled by vip tours as part of the package , and the connections between the airport and the resort were flawless , with a stop at one other resort to drop others off we found the slower ride part of the overall experience that gave us time to take it all in our open minds and adventuresome spirits helped us enjoy the ride from the airport to the resort for what it is , but the fact that our air and ground connections worked perfectly and our checked baggage arrived with us probably did a lot to set our mood just in case there was a baggage disconnect , we had enough in our carry on baggage to have dinner , sun bathe , and do anything else we might want to do for the first 24-36 hours we were met with the legendary champagne and cool , moist towel we had opted for the excellence club and booked an excellence club junior suite garden view from the beginning very nice , and no regrets for the extra price , for the amenities covered we were on the 2nd floor of the 8000 building the 4 poster bed was one of the most comfortable traveling beds we have ever had , nice and firm , which is what my wife and i prefer some specifics about the resort :1 we did have a single minor maintenance issue courtesy of a previous guest all we had to do was mention it to our concierge ricardo ( an absolute ace ) in the excellence club office and it was taken care of also we created 2 maintenance issues of our own , and again they were taken care of immediately make sure you ask specifically about the plumbing rules to avoid plugging the toilet remember that most of the maintenance issues are not the fault of the hotel , but of the guests if you want something specific , ask when my wife saw what was in the room mini - bar , she asked if they would add a bottle of bailey 's irish cream it was there within minutes if you do not see a room key sized do not disturb/make up room card to slip into your key slot , ask for one they make several trips to your room through the day for cleaning , newspaper delivery , evening turn down service , and linen/towel replacement i have seen several complaints about no washcloths they were there , only not with the other linens , but rolled discreetly on the vanity plenty of hangars , good iron , and ironing board are available in the room the room safe worked great , and we used it it had enough room for our money , wallets , passports , cell phones , 3 cameras , and an ipod lesson learned : you reset the combination each time the safe is opened do not go fiddling around in the safe after having a few drinks if you manage to make a mistake , it takes a trip to the front desk and a visit by security to get the safe opened we did our sunbathing on the beach rather than by the pools more lounges available when you want them people start reserving the ones around the pool really early i am a gym rat this resort has the best equipped/maintained facility i have ever used at a resort ( health club quality , with 2 recumbent bikes , 2 upright bikes , 4 treadmills , several elliptical trainers , dumbbells , smith machine , pec , shoulder , and abdominal , and lower body machines , and several multi - station machines for lats , shoulders , arms , and chest we tried all the restaurants for dinner except the grill and agave my favorites were toscana and chez isabelle our expectations were not met in the lobster house we took breakfast every morning in toscana , great spread so many choices also the live piano music every morning for breakfast was a very nice touch if you opt for any of the ground tours , you have to be transported over some of the same roads you took to the resort from the airport , so be prepared for a long ride we wanted to snorkel , and we signed up for a half day trip offering 2 opportunities , to snorkel with sting rays and nurse sharks , and then a run to an open water reef we got signed up for the afternoon trip that is normally when the vip tour desk books the american guests i understand the morning is multi - national if i was going to do it again , i would ask about the morning trip , because late in year the light in the water on the reef is not as good late in the afternoon also , the boat ride was a little rough , so if you think you might plan to do this , throw something for motion sickness in your luggage after the snorkeling is done and the boat heads for the dock , things turn festive with an open bar , loud music if you are already tired and feeling bad from the motion , it can be a long 45 minute run back to the dock , and even a longer ride back to the resort we brought our own gear , but there was plenty of gear available on the boat my spanish is somewhere between beginner and intermediate level we got by very well with that , but it was not necessary for us to have a good time many of the guests had no spanish it does not hurt to put a smile on and treat all the staff with courtesy we saw some guests that were absolute jerks that had no interaction with the resort staff except to be demanding i suppose they will be the ones who complain the most about their visit my suggestion is that if you want and expect things like you get in america , then vacation in las vegas we brought plenty of small bills for tipping , and although did not feel any obligation to tip at any time , we tipped certain people that i felt made our visit special if you tip , do not leave the tip on the table the person you intend it for may not get it enjoy your visit 
amazing beach , lackluster food and bedding my husband and i just got back from an eight - day stay at excellence punta cana the good : amazing beach powder soft sand , palm trees are gorgeous plenty of sunchairs and towels to lie on reserve a bed early with towels if you want a chance of getting one they also provide a lending library if you want a beach read the landscaping is superb not a leaf is out of place excellent gym and spa gym is new with a seperate room for classes and a room for all the new machines high ceilings , no funky sweat smell tennis pro ( rolando ) is a great teacher for both new and experienced tennis players the spa is also wonderful , with many services offered ( i 'd highly recommend the evening massage for two on the beach ) in a calm , sophisticated setting great horseriding opportunities i 'm an experienced rider , and i cantered on the beach every other morning in the ocean surf i wish they provided helmets and fed the horses a bit more , but the horses know there way around and the guides are friendly great after - dinner music for dancing on the main plaza my credit cards accidentally fell out of my purse on the beach , and they were returned to me that night by the staff who found them i was very appreciative roaming waiters attended to you on the beach to keep your drink full the bad : after checking in , i was not escorted to the room and just given a map , which was a bit of a let down i would have appreciated a guide to my room and explanation of the room 's amenities if i could make just one recommendation to the hotel , it would be to upgrade the bedding linens the mattress was flat ( no springs , just resting on a sheet of plywood ) , and the pillows were also flat if you 're used to softer down pillows , get ready for some neck - aches the blanket was pilling , and the comforter was tired and old looking think super 8 bedding quality the toiletries were also very basic i saw the excellence club offerings , the quality was pretty much the same ( we used the money we saved on not going with the upgrade to spend on activities , etc the food is also lacking the only thing the resort does well is pizza , but even that gets old after a while yes , i enjoy good dining options where i live in dc , but i felt the resort never provided a single consistently good meal beyond pizza for example , i tried the shrimp , apple , and avocado appetizer at the french restaurant , and it tasted like nothing puff pastry with snails consisted of rock hard pastry and escargot minced beyond recognition the evening restaurant food is not inedible , but the results do not live up to their descriptions the breakfast buffet had lots of options and a good egg station , and the lunch spread was decent agressive vendors are found at either end of the property questions are always the same : what 's your name first time to dr i 've got a present for you come look at my shop they are very persistent 
loved every moment i cannot not tell you what a great time we had on our honeymoon and excellence and their staff is to thank for that let me start from the very beginning : ride form airport to hotel : a bumoy ride but a great change to see what the dominican republic looks like also we rode with vip and they stopped at a local store so we could get beer for the ride so i was a happy camper arrival : to say the place takes your breath away is an understatement it was absolute perfection we received smiles and a welcome home and this treatment never stopped room : we were suppose to have an excellence club honeymoon suite but they had given our room away and i was pretty pissed about that but they put us in an excellence club suite and it was very nice looking back now we will always get a normal room because we were not in the room very long needless to say my anger did not last very long once i saw our view and got my bathing suit on food : absolutly amazing my favorite was the italian restaurant and the mexican for sure i did contract a bacterial stomach infection but i wasnt very careful while i was there my recommendation would be stay away from milk all together there pasterization processes arent like those in the states also watch drinking the slushy drinks from the machines because they are not required to keep those as clean like the states even with my tummy issues i forced myself to eat because the food was to good to pass up pools : i cant even describe how great they are we miss our pool buddies leaving excellence : what a depressing day when you have to leave your new home we did take the helicopter ride back from the resort to the airport and it was worth every penny because the pictures and the views are priceles best honeymoon spot in the world it is all adult couples and i cant wait to go back 
beautiful and friendly my husband and i stayed at excellence for 7 nights during thanksgiving week we travel alot and and have much experience with all inclusivesthe first 3 days the weather was not great because of a storm but the resort is beautiful and the swimming pools are great this place has 8 restaurants , each one from a different country the food was amazing probably the best we have had in an all inclusive resorts the only restaurant i would complain about is the lobster restaurant the lobster is from the carribean and not near as tasty as the main lobster most of us are used to the service at this one restaurant was not very good either the is the one and only complaint i have about this resort the service and friendlyness of the staff was wonderful the people at the spa know what they are doing the massages for my husband and i were great the conceirge desk is very accommodating in every aspect the ocean here has waves , so if you want a flat , no waves ocean , you are going to have to stay somewhere else i would recommend excellence punta cana to any couple 
resort was great , road to resort was awful the excellence resort was a well appointed resort with a very well trained staff i can not say enough good things about the resort itself the food was great , drinks just right , rooms very nice , pool perfect , beach well kept ( sand very soft , hard to walk on the beach without sinking very deep ) just a great time if you want to sit and do nothing not the place for an type a personality if on the other hand you like to venture out to see things other than the resort this is not the place for you it is 1 + hour away from anything else down the worst road you can imagine i have been on many mission trips to places that have bad access but this just about beats them all i would not go back just because of the trip to and from the hotel we went on a snorkling trip , which by the way was one of the best i have every been on anywhere in the world , and the trip there and back almost ruined the experience again the resort was great i have no complaint about the actual resort 
we stayed at the excellence nov we took are two young adult children as our last family vacation together the resort was very good required to pay $10 00 a piece at the airport we rode on the tour bus to and from the airport - it took about 1 hour 10min each way - with no stops in between the roads arent that bad - but my daughter did get car sick everyone was friendly at the resort our kids were upgraded to the excellence club - they enjoyed the extras we felt that it wasnt worth the money we could go to their room , use the same beach and pool as they did our room was on the 2nd floor excellence ocean view room it was big with two sliding doors we always tipped - and they are very grateful for $1- $5 i think that they would be nice and friendly either way make sure to bring plenty of money ( dollars ) there the atm machine only gives pesos and they dont give out dollars at the front desk we didnt have any trouble with finding chairs at the beach it seems like everybody wants to be at the pool instead the water is rough - but if you walked to the left of the resort on the beach and go to the bend t ( big piece of wood in the sand ) the water is smooth and great for swimming the horseback riding was fun the spa was the best the foot heaven and excellence massages are the best the food was good toscannas and oregano we liked the best michael jackson concert was good we didnt see any mosquitos or bugs - probably the time of year we went best prices on buying stuff - see paco at the resort store in the back he gave us some great prices and better quality stuff 
perfect time i spent a week from nov 22 to nov 29 at the excellence punta cana resort it was superb , i enjoyed every minute the resort has a very relaxing atmosphere and despite there were many people during the thanksgiving week it never felt busy the weather was not so good at the beginning of my stay but improved every day at the end it was almost as perfect as it can be there was always enough lounge chairs either at the beach or at the pool to enjoy the sunshine the ocean was a bit rough for swimming and if you like snorkelling you better book a trip at the resort to the nearby reef there are numerous activities that you can participate in throughout day and night the entertainment staff makes sure that you 're having tons of fun especially with mariel and santo i always had a great laugh dancing merengue was great everybody in the resort is very friendly and helpful there is a big choice of different restaurants and the food is very diversified i liked it pretty much wherever you are in this resort if you want to relax this is the place where you want to be 
fist of all we are not naive , are extremely well travelled and are realistic in our expectations we ignored most of the negative comments from trip advisor and took the common notion of people just like to complain ( we did not expect to be doing the same 14 days later ) so we departed with our hard earned cash and booked this amazing holiday , a romantic get a way , adult only , with expectations of relaxation , good food , friendly service and a stress free holiday we understand that it 's the caribbean , that it 's a tired resort and are the first to say that the grounds on which the resort is are breathe taking , but they should not be graded as a 5 star hotel and charging you for the privileged accommodation : so we arrived at the hotel , late unfortunately we had had a delay in flight not the hotels or anyone 's fault just one of them things but everything was going to be great for the next 14 days , well not quite , we had made sure when booking that we had a ocean view room , we wanted to see the ocean , but got there to be told that this was unavailable , how can a room be unavailable when it has been sold to you six months in advance , with guarantee , so we were upgraded , a master suite , or what was supposedly a master suite , okay it has an extra room but the room smelt of mould and was musty as previous reviews had said , it was so bad that we ended buying scented candles from the spa to keep the smell at bay , it was looking over the tennis courts and the cascade pool , now the room got no sunlight during the day , it looked like it had not been maintained at all , the door lock was broken and there was a gaping crack in the door , the coffee maker did not work and it just did not seem like 5 star accommodation to us but we tried to continue with our holiday and brush it off , who spends time in there room right after complaining for six days we finally got the room we had paid for an ocean view and it was amazing bright , no smell , the view was lovely we ended up spending evenings out on the balcony watching the ocean listening to the waves , even the coffee maker worked now after a few days we got talking to other couples who had exactly the same experience as us , had booked an ocean view , or garden terrace with the guarantee of having that room and where told that it was unavailable , do not let it happen to you , you pay extra supplements for these rooms you want what you food : what can we say about the food no way five star , they say there are 8 restaurants they are not really restaurants , they are limited in choice , do not get us wrong they do pizzas , hamburgers and other fast foodie stuff good , but if you are after a fantastic meal of delight in flavours do not go to the excellence we on numerous occasions where served cold food , we are not silly we stayed away from most of the buffet stuff its been sitting a long time and does not seem to be checked and changed as we have experienced in true 5 star hotels sickness : everyone we spoke to had at some stage in their holiday been sick , bad stomachs , gripping pains , diarrhoea my husband ended up in hospital for a day in punta cana with an intestinal infection on an iv drip , now we have travelled across the tropics , all over asia , have even eaten from a few side of the road stalls before and we have a good constitution , have never experienced upset stomachs like it but he was poorly and has come away from dom rep with a number of tablets as a souvenir be careful make sure you get everything hot , make sure your eggs are well done and stay away from the buffet food service : we do not mind tipping for good service , it is a third world country , the staff work extremely hard , but it is at a stage now that it is expected all this advice on tipping the staff so they look after you better is really true , you should not be expected to tip for everything , you pay enough for the holiday and it should be at your discretion if you feel you want to tip an individual for good service there are guests at the hotel that tip constantly , for every drink ordered , for daily chamber service , for room service for everything , this really has created expectations from the staff for tips for doing their jobs , like i say we tip for good service but should not have to feel pressured to do so , and it certainly should not affect the service provided if you do not entertainment : there are no red coats like at butlins but they are green t - shirts entertainment is a joke , okay yes it 's the carribbean but why is this the excuse for everything , it 's bad , you will want to spend time in your room , people in wigs , badly miming to music , you need to be drunk to even think its okay , we do not drink heavily that 's may be the problem on this whole holiday if you are after sophistication , romance and mature evenings the excellence is not for you , if you like to get drunk all day and do not have high expectations of food and entertainment and like to see adults getting loud , obnoxious and rude , this is the place to go 
we loved it , given our expectations we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at excellence , while noticing many of the the things we expected to see/experience thanks to reading months of reviews the arrival and check through at the airport is the easiest you can ever experience no hassles , the lines moved as fast as one could walk and 5 min after you step off the plane you are grabbing your checked luggage and off to your transport the ride to the property was not bad at all , this was typical of the third world and we had a rep from vip travel aboard as well as the driver to tell us about his country and what to expect from our stay ( we knew already , but he told us to brush teeth/drink w/ bottled water only ) arrival and check in was swift and friendly the room is beautiful as we always book lowest category it 's still a suite best we 've ever had there were a few issues there ( some sugar ants , mini fridge luke - cool and such ) , but we are very easy to please and they did not cast a cloud in any way to the room channel 21 was a plus , wife and i enjoyed that if not for the obvious , but the hilarity of some of it the food in the restuarants was not bad , nor spectacular , but we knew this going in and did not starve breakfast we would have liked to be a bit better as they have cooked to order omelets/eggs/pancakes , but very little as far as choice as to what goes in them chunked ham , shredded cheese , bell pep , and onion was it for the omelets other places have had the same w/ mushrooms , spinach , even crab meat , which let the wife down a bit many choices on the bfast buffet but too many which were 'nt breakfast fare ( chili , grilled chicken and such ) the ala carte rests them all ) were good , as we never waited to get in and they did better than we expected we had to try it and it just is not great drinks - all good , every bar , we were surprised to see that most of the frozen drinks like pina coladas are very fibrous , as you chew on them as much as you sip from the straw , tasty though all the premium hooch is there , just ask the pool - chair - towel situation is horrendous wife and i realized on day 1 if you ca not beat em , join em so i actually got up early every day before my 1st coffee or bm and layed out a book , beach bag , sunblock cans , and everything like at 7am ( when all the europeans did it ) so you could say that we were some of the worst culprits in this routine , but you do what you have to if you want a chance all day to be able to hang at the pool the beach - gorgeous , but not very user friendly the waves are too intimidating to try going in and i predict that this is the case year round others have stated that a short walk off the property brings a calmer section this is true but you 'll never have it calm enough to feel comfortable really swimming in great view , though a spectacularly beautiful , yet violent , beach right off the property on the beach is the shack mall shopping very nice as we were prepared to haggle we did 'nt as the $$ they were asking was very fair ( nancy wanted $20 for 3 t - shirts ) i felt like i 'd be a jerk to try to talk her down from that definitely visit these folks the wares they sell are all exactly what you see for sale at the vendor tables for very less $$ we came prepared for every stomach ailment w/ meds we brought from home and did find them very useful even without over indulging in the food/drink/sun we were a little disappointed in the evenings as everything revolves around the nightly theater show it is very consistantly good , but not what we really care for on a romantic getaway ( one night was actually karaoke night , anyone who has experienced a bowling alley lounge knows how this can get annoying , especially with the volume we prefer to continue our pool time ( in a functional jacuzzi , none were working ) in the evenings outside w/ an open bar close by that 's not the case at excellence but it 's just their policy pools closed at 6 pm , nights could get a little on the cool side anyway ( always a good breeze , though ) mosquitos were not an issue , we came prepared but did 'nt experience them at all like a previous poster said , they must have moved on the service is the best in the world top notch staff , more extra touches than one could imagine any all inclusive could learn from this place take care walking around the resort as all the floors resemble , or are , marble and get very slick the social scene is more reserved here on the whole we met some couples that were awesome and will probably stay in touch with ( as we always do ) but it 's more of a mixed bag of nationalities than most places in the carribbean ( with their varied languages ) which makes it a bit more difficult to bond with other guests , even if you are an extrovert all in all it was wonderful , though we knew most of it going in , and feel like we got what we paid for as for returning , i would say yes but maybe a few years in the future if finances dictate punta cana , or nothing 
excellence was excellent everything @ excellence punta cana was superb from the moment we arrived and were greeted with champagne , cool fragrant towels , and a welcome home from the staff the bell staff : vidal morales , eduard , eduardo , francisco , and miguel diaz were extremely helpful guiding us through the resort and genuinely made us feel welcome executive chef berthold dettweiler kopf along with a host of chefs and restaurants manager victor doroteo were the overseers of eight [8] restaurants , each serving magnificent meals with a wait staff unparrelled to any i 've ever seen the entertainment staff , especially cesar , was always on hand to keep you as busy as you wanted to be front desk [raul , ibhar] , wait staff [luz mary , yeni , joan] and all the bartenders were extremely pleasant , polite , and proficient the service was absolutely spectacular in every area , and we will definitey return to excellence , punta cana 
not the same the second time my wife and i just returned from excellence where we stayed from 11/21-11/26 this was our second time staying at excellence and was far less enjoyable than our first visit in july 2007 here are some of the issues we noticed this time : * the pool chair/towel insanity as previous reviewers have mentioned , most pool chairs are reserved with towels and personal belongings by 9:00 am and all towels are gone from the towel shelves by this time as well so if you have a massage in the morning or go horse back riding at 10 am or simply want to sleep in you literally will have no place to sit at the pool and no way to get a pool towel there seems to be no recognition from the staff that this is a problem * the food while i appreciate the resort 's variety of food options , including asian , french , mexican , pizza , hamburgers/sandwiches , and italian , the result is that none of the food is particularly good the best food is the simplest , like breakfast buffet items and food from the grill like hamburgers asking chefs in a tropical resort to be experts in japanese or french food is going to lead to disappointment for most people some of the food was okay , but we left dinner most night unsatisfied and sometimes still hungry compounding the problem is that the menus are written by workers with a limited command of english , describing food that they probably do not have a good idea about as a result you sometimes literally have no idea what you are ordering like others have mentioned , both my wife and i got sick during our time at excellence since we never left the resort , we can only assume that some food or drink at the resort was the problem we have traveled to various places in the caribbean and to tanzania in africa and have never gotten sick like we did at excellence while we enjoyed aspects of our trip , we were disappointed that we would have to deal with these issues at a 5 star resort 
we stayed at epc nov 18-25, and loved every minute of it the weather was not great , it rained all day one day , and on/off another there was also a lot of cloudy windy days we actually didi not miss it that much the spa is awesome we had a hot stone massage , and a couple 's massage both were wonderful the couple 's massage , they give you a chilling bottle of champagne and chocolates after it was so nice my husband also got his scuba diving certification there the team at the dive shop was great reggie was his instructor , and was fantastic our room was great we had room 4102, right at the cascade pool it is one of the few rooms with a semi - private balcony , as there is trees in front , so we felt we had some privacy we had no ants , or bugs , mini - bar and snacks were filled daily , but we did leave him a tip every day we also asked for a bottle of smirnoff and some clamato juice in our room , as i do not like beer we gave him a couple of bucks , and he brought it , no problem the circus show was amazing i have not been to an all - inclusive yet that put on a show like that the only problem i found was the lounge chairs it wou not be so bad , if people did not reserve them , and then not use them all day i was at one resort ( ca not remember which one ) that if you did not use your chair for two hours , you lost it this should be done everywhere , so everyone gets a chair people had towels on chairs all day , and never used them once overall , we loved this resort for couples , it 's a perfect romantic getaway we 'll be back 
no where near excellence this was a long awaited vacation with 2 other couples that we travel with every year , sometimes twice a year before booking the resort , i emailed the excellence head office and asked about internet access , i am self - employed and all of my vacations are working vacations and i cannot book without the resort having internet the head office emailed me back very quickly with a response explaining that the whole resort including all the rooms have wireless internet access i booked our trip that day we arrived at the resort very late on saturday night , service was friendly but we were sent to find our own rooms , through some hallways that were very dark , one of the couples was in 11 block and 2 of us were in 14 block we found our rooms with help from the pizza delivery guy the room was very nice , not very cool , the air conditioning on the 3rd floor of the resorts does not seem to work very good i setup my computer to make sure there was internet no network to be found , i called to the front desk and explained , he said that he was not sure about the internet and that some of the rooms could not connect , i decided to go back to the front desk to request a room change and/or see what could be done , the person at the front desk did not speak the best english and he proceeded to try to find another room this took about an hour of him playing on the computer he said that he would have a bellhop take me to another room to see if the internet worked it is not 12:30am and we finally found a room that is vacant and has internet , awesome lets move the bags down i need to check with the front desk , the person at the front desk explaines that the room is vip and it has a view i explain that i do not care about a view i just need the internet the reception explains that i can have the room for an extra charge $ , after arguing with the gentleman for 10 to 15 minutes and not getting a head , i asked for his manager no managers on staff at night , it is now 1am and i am told that there will be a manager in the hotel at 8am , i agree to stay in my room until the morning my husband and i are in the lobby for 8am no manager no concierge , i am told they will be there for 9am , i return at 9am to speak with the concierge , i explained the situation and she asked that i give her an hour , at 10am i returned , she had sorted the problem out and was giving us the vip room that we were in the night before , but we needed to wait until 12:30, she then put me intouch with a manager ( edward ) , he explained that he wanted to have the room clean and that he would have a bellhop at our current room for 12:30, i waited at the room and no bellhop , called to the front desk to request service and they asked me to wait until 1:30 i was extremely upset and angry , i said absolutely not , i need service not and asked that someone come immediately , the bellhop was sent i finally got into my room and unpacked , the room was clean but things were missing , coffeemaker with no coffee pot , no hand soap , no face clothes and 1 hand towel , 1 robe , i called down to the front desk and asked for the items , i received the robe and hand towel the next morning i called to ask again for the coffee pot and received room service instead , this is better then the coffee pot that is what i was told my husband and i were waiting in the main lobby for our friends where we were approached from a hotel employee who seem to be a manager , he ended up being the general manager of the hotel , after explaining the problems , he asked that i come and see him if we had anymore i told him about the coffee pot and there was 1 in my room within minutes after meeting him , we had a few more discussions about his hotel for 1 of the couples - no turn down service for 2 or 3 nights and no cleaning service at all for one day , and there ac did not work right for the whole week even after complaining a few times to concierge for another couple - no face clothes and limited towels , there dvd player and jacuzzi tub did not work they did fix the tub but it took a day or so for my husband and i the room was ok not a 5 star hotel by any means , still never received hand soap , and our jacuzzi would not hold water we also had a few creepy crawlers in our room restaurants - the buffet is great for breakfast and lunch and the only place we enjoyed for dinner was the french restaurant the grill was terrible , bareclona was ok the seafood was very fishy smelling and tasting toscana - food was good the service was aweful the beef in most restaurants was not good , over cooked and very tuff grounds - very very nice , the beach was good , but it was red flagged for the whole week bar staff - excellent jenny who works in the theater section is awesome very ver friendly we requested 1 room for all of us on the last day because of the late check out , the manager said that he would speak to us on friday ( the day before leaving ) to see if they had one available , he explained that there was a $20 per person per hour charge i looked at him and said no way with all the problems you want to charge us more he told me to come back and see him on friday and he would see what he could do we ended up getting one room for the 6 of us to stay in until we had to leave for the airport in whole , the resort is nice but i do not believe it should be classified as a 5 star they really need to work on the little things i do not believe i will ever be back unless they make some serious chanages 
great honeymoon resort but this was our first time to the excellence great honeymoon destination , landscaping on the resort was breathtaking overall the grounds including the pools were very well maintained our favorites were agave  spice for dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed the daily breakfast buffet at tuscana the service at the resort bars and restaurants was great as well there was even a daily beach bbq which we really enjoyed they cooked something different for lunch each day right on the beach pizzas were also handed out on the beach and at the pools during certain times of the day one day they even brought out fruit kabobs while we were laying on the beach the shows were also good we did not think we 'd be into going to the shows , but the few we went to were great they bring you a schedule of the shows and activities to your room each day so you can decide ahead of time if there is a show you would be interested in seeing plan ahead though because if you get there too late the seating is all taken the included horseback riding was really nice although we do not recommend the atv tour the resort offers for $80 basically they take you to the outskirts of punta cana , which is very underdeveloped and the dirt roads are extremely bumpy there is no reason to leave the resort on your own from what we could tell , there is not much outside the resort and if you do not know your way around it has the potential to be shady we also must say that the rooms need attention upon entering we were greeted with a very musty smell and many of the room amenities needed updating the jacuzzi tub took 45 minutes to fill up and the refrigerator kept things cool at best the service to the room could have been improved on as well our door would not lock at one point and they left us waiting an hour before someone came to fix it also , one night we had ants and it took an hour for someone to bring us bug spray the room service takes at least an hour each time you order and you get the feeling you are bothering them when you do place an order our mini bar was filled once in the week we were there , and should have been filled daily luckily , you do not spend much time at all in your room , and once you leave your room you are welcomed by paradise so it does not matter as much overall , great experience we would consider staying at an excellence resort again 
loved the entire experience the resort was beautiful and well maintained all members of the staff were friendly and helpful and always smiling the entertainment staff , especially inez , caesar , wainy , and juan carlos were so much fun they were always willing to dance with me and show me new steps all of the meals were delicious and the variety of drinks too numerous to name , but very tasty all of the members of my party (20) had a great experience and days ( and nights ) of fun the entire staff deserves a raise and lots of praise 
i 've been reading reviews for excellence punta cana for quite some time some of the reviews i read before going made me wonder if we made the proper choice some of the reviews that i read since returning home make me wonder if we were at the same place the only thing i can say about the negative reviews is that they must come from people who just really hate life and need to have something to complain about to be content , or they just have really high standards i 'm sure if you constantly scrutinize a property , any property , you can always find something wrong with it with people coming and going all the time , i 'm sure no property is perfect is it really worth wasting time and energy dwelling on it why not make the best of it yes , the roads are bumpy and it is a long ride from the airport however , it is something to talk about and laugh about later on i read that someone got bit by a duck they are not tame animals even a dog will bite if provoked or having an off day i read that there were bugs and cockroaches it 's a tropical island we did not see any bugs the entire time we were there , nor did we come home with bug bites it 's too bad that people feel they were not treated properly has anyone ever heard that you reap what you sow i saw some of the attitudes being directed at the waitstaff and housekeeping department i saw people order room service and then leave before it arrived because the clock was wrong in their room i saw people order food in restaurants that was not even on the menu and the staff bent over backwards to meet the request we stayed at the excellence punta cana from 11/7/08 through 11/14/08, and it was fabulous we received champagne and cold cloths upon our arrival and were greeted with welcome home everyone went out of their way to make us feel welcome and pampered if we did lack something , we called the concierge and it was taken care of immediately they even follow up in a few hours or the next day to make sure we were satisfied the food was excellent , not like at home , but is not that the whole idea of getting away from home to experience new things the drinks flowed freely and often we had no problem with any type of drinks ( alcohlic or not ) or service our experience was one we will remember and cherish forever all of the employees and managers were 'johnny - on - the - spot ' it 's sad that some people feel it necessary to not only ruin it for themselves but for others as well as with the other reviews , this is only my opinion and you know what they say about opinions 
i do not have adequate words to describe this outstanding place my husband and i went to epc from 10/31/08 - 11/05/08 for our 17th wedding anniversary we could not have been more pleased this place is heaven on earth we just sat in awe of how beautiful this entire place is the beach is beyond beautiful the sand is as soft as powder and the water is just so relaxing to sit and watch it is very rough , please do not be fooled by its beauty we frequently go to the jersey shore so i thought nothing of the reviews of how rough the sea was , until i got in wow , it knocked me over without any warning enjoy the shallow water and watch your back the waves change without any warning this did not in any way change our thoughts on this marvolous place we could not have chosen a better place to vacation the people that work here are the nicest people on the planet they are always smiling and ready to meet your every wish we stayed in an excellence club junior suite garden view we were more than happy with our room robert  carlos , from the excellence club went out of their way to make our stay as perfect as possible thank you both for an outstanding vacation the upgrade to the excellence club is worth every penny they are at your beck and call whenever you need them the service from everyone was outstanding the food choices are more than expected if you cannot find something you like , i would be suprised i asked my husband about our 3rd day there if he was suprised that i had not complained about anything yet ( i 'm known to be a bit picky ) i could not find one thing to complain about we read all the reviews before we left and were a little worried i can say without hesitation that this is the best vacation we 've ever had my only regret is that our stay was not longer the excellence punt cana is a place you must experience for yourself words cannot do justice to such a magistical place go and enjoy we cannot wait to go back to say we loved it is an understatement 
poor management - no way it 's even fair vs excellence go to secrets excellence has deteriorated under new mgt visited secrets excellence punta cana 6yrs ago and it was fabulous , then went to secrets capri mexico 4yrs ago - again terrific excellence new mgt has allowed maintenance to suffer - old fixtures with lime build up , broken toilets , very poor upkeep on maintenance housekeeping mgt also is to blame for allowing the hard working housekeepers to keep their carts everywhere pull them into the rooms , we do not want to walk around these things , we saw many dirty rags drying on the balcony 's , dirty mop buckets , no towels ever to dry your hands , no toilet paper rolls so tp is soggy at the pool/beach bathrms , elevators never been cleaned and used by mini bar stock staff so carts of dirty/clean glasses everywhere , scuff marks covered the walls the food was awful , all pre - prepared so old , never get your order right , no music , open til 10:30pm but either do not take you after 9:30pm and by 10pm stop piano and turn off a/c to push you out the door same buffet for breakfast/lunch/desserts - recycle old food all 4 of us had major stomach issues keeping us in the bathroom the entire stay - - - perfectly well the first day home so it was the food the dominican dinner outside was done very nice but the food was gross they served raw chicken and shrimp skewers i kept telling the cook i did not want it yet , it was not cooked , i could see pink ( it was dark outside ) and shrimp still blue on one side he just laughed at me when i pulled my plate away well that night at the circus show we saw many people running to the bushes throwing up we could not eat more than half our meals and survived on oreos and pizza gross , we wanted fillet , lamb , duck so the maintenance dir , housekeeping dir and restaurant dir need to be fired the landscaping crew do an amazing job keeping up and it shows , the grounds are prestine - so the groundskeeping supervisor is doing his job very well we were shocked that this vacation did not meet our expectations and tried to speak with the gm who never took my meetings and wasted too much of my time explaining our disappointments our friends never got a champagne welcome and we did not get cool cloths no biggie but if you pride yourself on committing to your services i wrote we were repeat guest and i was assured our upgraded ocean view rm would be great we moved in 15min b/c i was looking at 2 bldgs and no ocean rooms never ready by 3pm chk in pools close at 6pm - why no towels by 11am and again none replaced at 4pm - i told a mgr at 4pm we needed towels , just returned from horseback for a refreshing swim he never brought us towels cascade pool has no cocktail server so dirty glasses and water bottles everywhere they lost attention to detail and quality service and food - excellence mgt is to blame not the hard workers who take direction be expected to be ignored , get diarrhea , eat nothing , air dry your hands after the bathroom and air dry at the pool , get your own drink gm - you are running this beautiful place into the ground - shame on you for collecting a paycheck 
perfect for our honeymoon my husband and i chose the excellence punta cana for our honeymoon , and it definitely did not disappoint we did a lot of research on the different resorts in punta cana , and excellence seemed to have everything we were looking for and it was also the most well - reviewed punta cana resort on all the travel sites we looked at i 'll try to be as thorough as possible in reviewing all aspects of our trip we stayed for 6 nights/5days in october 2008 we connected from la via miami , and had no problems getting into the country it was a breeze moving through customs there - you pay $10 to get a tourist card , which once you get you just hand over to the next official , so its just a fee for entering the country have your customs form filled out and your $10 ready and you 're all set right after customs you come into an area packed with bellhops ( for lack of a better word ) , who all jockey for position to help everyone arriving we told our guy who our shuttle company was ( prieto tours , recommended hen you book through american express ) , he took our luggage and got us right over to their desk we were then ushered right out to the waiting shuttle bus , and although we did have a bit of a wait before we got moving , it was a large tour bus , air - conditioned and very comfortable our bus driver and guide were both very nice and informative , giving us a few tips on the ride there the ride to the hotel took about 75 minutes , and was definitely not as bad as other reviewers have made it out to be i guess it depends on which shuttle/taxi you take although our bus was very nice , large , and newer , there were some sorry - looking ones at the airport as well yes , its a long drive , and the road was often bumpy and winding , but we were very comfortable and i enjoyed taking in the scenery the road takes you through at least 2 towns , giving you also a glimpse of the local life in the dr we arrived at the hotel and were greeted with smiles and champagne we splurged on the excellence club , which in my opinion was definitely worth it , for reasons i will detail later because of this , we were escorted straight to the excellence club for check - in there we were given a tour of the excellence club , some information regarding our stay and what to expect , and then taken to our room the concierge was so nice , helpful , and accomodating throughout our stay our room was clean and comfortable throughout our stay , although the bed was definitely harder than i prefer housekeeping would come twice a day ( once in the morning and once for turn down ) and our mini bar was also re - stocked twice a day even though we did not need it replenished that often they also give you a newsletter each night detailing the activities going on the next day , which restaurant is closed , and the weather report the only issue i had was getting some bites on my feet and ankles on the second night - and the only thing we could attribute them to was something in the bed , because i slept underneath the covers but my husband slept on top of them , and he was not bitten at all i got a few more throughout our stay , but they were just red bumps and never hurt or itched or bothered at all , so i 'm not sure what they came from october must be a slow time for the resort , because it was not crowded at all and we never once had problems with getting a good spot by the pool or on the beach , and never had to wait at any restaurant or very long for drinks people were out early claiming chairs by the pool , but that seemed unnecessary because there was always more than enough to go around i love the fact that this resort is adults only which also meant it was mostly couples , which gave the entire atmosphere a safe , calm , and relaxing vibe our favorite spot was right by the swim - up bar - definitely our favorite bar the bartender was awesome and made all our favorite drinks and anything we requested , and we had fun trying out new ones ( ask for the sammy sosa or a coco loco i 'm not a big drinker because i generally do not like the taste of alcohol , but the drinks were made so well i could hardly even tell they had alcohol ( which i knew they did because i watched him mix them up we spent most of our days in and around the pool at the swim - up bar , and a few times we went over to the beach in the afternoons the beach was gorgeous and i loved napping on the beds the water was warm but the waves were so strong that not too many people ventured out i think this could have been because it was still in hurricane season , so i 'm not sure if htey are like that all the time there were certain areas marked off to not go into , and just one small area that was safer but still warned against because of the strength of the waves we had a good time just watching people get knocked down , including my husband who thought he could dominate the waves the food was good , sometimes great , nothing outstanding for breakfast and lunch you are limited in the options we went to toscana every day and had the buffet i think the lobster house was also open with lighter breakfast options , and the grill was open for lighter lunch options they did try to change up the buffet options but we definitely had had enough of it by the time we left because we were eating at toscana every day for breakfast and lunch , we never tried it for dinner there are seven restaurants at the resort and each night one of them is closed no reservations needed for any of them some of them do have dress codes that they do enforce , however ladies can get away with more , but be sure to bring some nicer dresses , pants , and dressy sandals for men most of the places required pants , collared shirts , and shoes each one is a different cuisine and they all have rather limited menus the first night we went to the lobster house , where lobster is really the only thing on the menu and you can choose how you want it cooked and what side dish you want it was decent , but not good enough to want to go back agave is the mexican place , and the only thing i liked there were the chips and guacamole , although my husband liked his entree spice is asian , and was perfect for a lighter meal , we both really enjoyed it and it was the only place we went twice chez isabelle is french cuisine and my husband and i agreed that it was the best complete meal we each had we did not go to barcelona ( mediterranean ) or the grill room service is also available , and we did order something on our last night but it never came but the service was great everywhere all of the staff , waiters , hostesses , bartenders , etc were so friendly , courteous , accomodating and helpful they all spoke at least a little english , so communicating was never an issue for us we followed the advice of some other reviewers and just brought $100 in $1 bills , and used that all week for tipping everyone really appreciated the tips and you could tell they were not always expecting it we also spent a few nights at the sports bar after dinner , although never for very long because it 's outdoors and would get very humid and the bugs were pretty thick there there are a few pool tables , foosball tables , and ping pong , and some big tv screens for watching sports its a smaller bar but they also had various snack items available each night ( popcorn , nachos , chicken wings ) we were glad we went for the excellence club , because that gave us free internet use and access to the excellence lounge , which was always stocked with beverages and lighter food options all throughout the day there is also a tv up there and bar service , so it was more comfortable to hang out there than at one of the outdoor bars we did not do any of the extra activities they offer , like horseback riding , but they are available the casino in the resort was closed for maintenance , but they were offering a free shuttle to a nearby resort if you wanted to gamble the nightly entertainment was sometimes entertaining ( michael jackson show was pretty funny ) and sometimes too painful to watch ( karaoke ) overall , the excellence punta cana was a wonderful choice and we would definitely go back the best points for me are its all - inclusive and adults - only , the location is perfect and the staff was awesome i would highly recommend excellence please feel free to contact me if you would like any further detail on anything 
bueno not excellente after coming off an awesome honeymoon at excellence riviera maya last year , my husband  i decided to try excellence punta cana this year we kinda wished we just went back to mexico let me just start off by saying we are not picky new yorkers by any means although the resort is beautiful and i being a beach person , thought the beach was more tropical and gorgeous here , the standards of the hotel and service were much lower upon arrival , our room was in building 14 ( the very left end and last building of the resort ) very far walk from anything not that much of a bother to us though we had a wonderful view of the ocean from that building although these rooms were smaller than the ones in mexico the problem with the room was cockroaches we killed 4 the 1st day we insisted on being moved to another building but could not be accommodated until the second day they sent up a can of raid to spray everywhere the next morning i woke up with bug bites all over my legs i know this is a tropical country and i was prepared with bug spray and all , but i still could not get over the amount of bites i had in the course of a week i 'm home 4 days and still have marks although they did not seem to like my husband so maybe it 's something with the women after moving to our second room in building 6, more directly in the middle of the resort , but with less of an ocean view ( at this point we really did not care ) i had asked the front desk on 3 occasions to bring us a coffee maker and ironing board we never received either all week the restaurants are the same as the other resort except that spice in punta cana did not have a hibachi grill room set up like they had in mexico not a big deal , just wondered why this was the food menus were pretty much the same , not much to complain about or rave about we were disappointed that the casino was closed the casino they offer to take you to at sirinis ( next hotel over ) had 3 tables and was very boring we looked forward to meeting people and playing a daily game of texas hold em like we had last year , though there was no such thing on the entertainment slip here : ( the entertainment crew will to get you into activities and we did do a few that were fun - i must complain about the music they play everyday on the beach drove us nuts it 's the same tracks over and over and over i for one like to listen to the waves and relax a little music for a little while is ok , but by the second or third day we started to realize this was all they had - omg take an ipod vendors come on site 3 nights a week and all they do is hassle you when you walk by what a pain in the [ - - ] we had to try to walk around the beach to get to our room and avoid them or jump in the pool and swim away they put a necklace on you and ask you what you like , what you want to pay for it and wrap it up and let you take it before you pay them i mean its good in a way if you are looking to bargain and buy stuff but there is duty free at the airport going home same $hit they are just really annoying we bought a few things form one of the vendors on the beach so yeah be careful when you take a walk to the left or to the right they come right down to the water and try and get your business i hate having to write so much in a review that sounds so negative , but i want to be honest we pay enough for a vacation and i was open to reading previous opinions my husband got severely ill halfway through the trip with high fever , major stomach issues and cramping i 've never seen him so sick before cost him 2 days of our trip he believes it was from brushing your teeth in the sink from the tap water that or maybe bad ice they tell you the ice is safe , but you never know i started feeling sick the morning we were leaving and got hit with the same illness our first night home just started feeling better today lasted 3 days for me i just thank god i was home already it really was awful and painful i 'm not even going to talk about the ride to and from the airport i was already prepared from reading about it on trip advisor - and seriously i thought new york potholes were bad after a harsh winter - you have no idea sad to see how poor and dirty the country is too because it really is beautiful to sum up , the beach was beautiful , the grounds were beautiful , the gym was modern , the entertainment was fun , the birds hanging around were cool to play and take pics with ( warning stay away from the big white ducks ) one shot out of no where and bit me hard on my leg i still have a bruise from that little effer if you came to this resort 1st you would think it was excellent , but if you went to mexico already - your standards and expectations will be too high for this resort we 'll be going back to mexico sorry punta cana 
wonderful as always my wife and i have stayed at the excellence resorts in both mexico and punta cana and as always enjoy punta cana the staff in the excellence club are top notch and each visit they have continued to impress ricardo cedano assisted us with check in and check out and any want that we had in between everything was handled very professionally we decided on the helicopter to take us out , last minute , ricardo handled everything and made sure that our check out and departure was perfect the grounds and food were very good and although the beach was rough at the time , we still enjoyed the water on a couple of days the pool and swim up bar are always great anyway i would highly recommend visiting the excellence and look up ricardo in the excellence club if you get a chance 
excellent , loved it secrets excellence made a perfect honeymoon - lovely food , endless amounts of champagne , rum cocktails etc along with a big hot tub in your room we were greeted with champagne and towels as we got there and settled into our large room very quicky the bus trip from the airport was very rough so we got the helicopter back which was well worth it the hotel 's private beach was lovely and it was great fun to boogie board waves were too choppy to do much else weather in july was mixed , mainly sunny but a few storms entertainment was ok but we were not there for that so did not care restaurants were all great but could have done with more variety with a la carte menus spa was excellent and made great use of the gym and classes too there was not much to do outside your resort so 14 nights is a bit long but it was our honeymoon after all so was not complaining 
great resort we decided to ignore the few negative reviews and spent oct 18-26 at the excellence here are my random comments and suggestions that may not have been mentioned by others : do not worry about the ride from the airport mosquitoes are not a problem bring one can of spray for when you plan to explore the gardens or enjoy the dominican day dinner on the beach the food is excellent we skipped the lobster house and oregano the others were great never had to wait never had a need for room service there 's also a daily cookout on the beach , and sandwiches and fruit at some of the bars ca not say enough about the booze do not miss the michael jackson show get there 1 hr early sit near the middle because the stage lighting fixtures obscure some of 'michael 's ' awesome footwork also see the ??ouples? with guest participation - ours was hilarious after every show , the cast is available for photos we did not go for the excellence club package i suggest you do not book it in advance when you check in , have them explain exactly what you would get if you upgrade , and for how much if interested , you may be able to bargain sign up for the free horseback ride early if it gets canceled by rain you can still make another one later in the week we left $2 daily for the maid , even though service was erratic ( i think this is due to the layout of the buildings they ca not keep checking rooms to find ones that are empty ) since we asked for diet soda ( coke light ) in the room fridge , we twice left a $2 tip next to it for the refiller person there 's a 3- piece roving band at two of the restaurants gave them $3 total each time i suspect they get little or nothing from the hotel occasional $1 to those who brought us drinks during the show at the theater the only other tip we gave was $25 on our final day to alta , the waitress who brought us endless drinks on the beach there was never any pressure to tipbring a refrigerator magnet it may trick the sensor on the balcony door so that you do not have to keep closing it to keep the ac on wireless internet access worked okay in the room and on the beach , but was slow internet access ( $5 for 20 min ) is available a short walk from the rooms the grounds are beautiful ponds , fountains , statues , birds of all types including parrots , one of which plucked a button from my shirt ( they also like eyeglasses ) once we even saw a peacock in the lobby lots of exercise equipment at the rec center there 's 4 tv 's if there 's no attendant available , you can change channels with the control hidden on the right side it you 'd like to use a laptop or other ac - powered appliance on the balcony , bring an extension cord of 12 feet or longer also , all of the outlets are taken up by lamps , tv , etc bring one of those 1- to -3 adapter thingamajigs american plugs work fine snorkeling at the hotel beach and the neighboring beach is poor due to the waves and swirling sand do not bother to bring your own gear unless you plan to take an off - premise excursion we had two short power outages at night , and one loss of water pressure no big thing use a battery - powered alarm clock or watch if you need to get up early as always when traveling , clear out the room safe on the night before departure so that you wo not have a major problem if there 's no electricity in the morning there 's a small duty - free shop at the airport if you have to change planes , remember that bottles of liquid cannot be taken through security do not climb on the lifeguard stand to get a good photo i broke a step and almost killed myself totally my fault it can be difficult to get a float at the pools selfish people tend to grab one early and stash it with their stuff all day i wish the hotel would adopt a ??o not remove from water? some also hoard those beds on the beach , but since it 's hard to read while lying on one , we did not use them even when available final suggestion : go , eat , drink , relax , enjoy 
what a trip we just arrived home from our fabulous vacation last week after a horrible start to our vacation , we certainly made up for it at the excellence , punta cana we had a 6 hour delay in miami due to engine problems with the plane after arriving at the airport in punta cana at approximately 8:00 p ( we were supposed to be there by 3:00 p ) , we were taken on a bus ( caribe ) to the resort you must be very careful at the airport because people are coming at you from all directions to get your luggage you must be quite stern about where you want your luggage to go the bus ride was a ride from hell you definitely need a massage after this trip the roads are not paved they have potholes like you have never seen before arrival at the hotel was at approximately 9:30 p and we were literally beat we had a quick dinner at the lobster house and a quick drink and hit the sack the next day was breathtaking in daylight the grounds are so beautiful and the room also was very nice ( and very clean ) we explored and had breakfast the food was awesome the only thing the dominicans ca not cook is steak the steaks are so much better in the u my husband was deperate to come home to a nice steak however , the food was tremendous other than the beef we did get sick though we did not drink the water out of the taps we only drank the water in the bottles however , we still got the runs maybe from ice it certainly did not ruin the vacation the staff are the nicest people you will ever meet - - especially jose at the cafe cafe he 's the bartender what a character my only problem is that it is over , and we are back to the same old stuff i guess we have to work in order to go on another fabulous trip i ca not wait you certainly will not be disappointed with your choice of excellence , punta cana anne and brian 
enjoyed our trip , but we wo not be back let me start off by saying they we were a group of 6 staying in building 4 this was my second trip to punta cana and 1st trip to epc my first trip in 2006 we stayed at the gran bahia punta cana and loved it overall we had a good vacation while epc is a beautiful resort with an amazing staff , i can say upfront that we will not return they do try to do their best , but when you are charging top dollar more needs to be done to make sure things are ran smoothly and more consistent several of my same complaints were consistent with others that we met while we were there my main point is this , while no vacation is perfect and problems can rise anywhere , when you charge what they charge , you definitely need to step up your game i felt epc dropped the ball too many times while some issues may appear minor , that?? half the problem it?? so minor that it?? aggravating that it?? not fixed again , we made the best of everything and i must say with that attitude we still had a fabulous time i have no regrets for picking this place but in all fairness i do feel the need to offer my honest opinion of how my stay was i too can now understand how two families can have two totally different vacation experiences at the same hotel/resort the good stuff : staff is outstanding and they try their hardest to please everyone the spa was awesome and so was the staff we did the couples ritual and it was amazing let me tell you the drinks were very good and they offered pretty good quality liquor the resort itself is very beautiful and clean while the beach is a little rough , we still found it very relaxing to just lay out at the beach for the day the pools were very relaxing and refreshing ( especially the cascading pool ) another of our favorite spots the food overall was actually pretty good especially spice and toscana the lobster house on the other hand is horrible i?? not even sure you can call that lobster that they served no wonder there was ever a wait to eat here pure hot mess the mozzies were out and hungry , but we did fine with only 5 or 6 bites they do a pretty good job spaying every evening not so good stuff : everyone in my group got sick and still is 5 days later not sure what it was , but thank god we brought imodium and pep to bismol with us , almost od on it ( lol ) but again , we are all still suffering from stomach cramps , diarrhea , and nausea and its 5 days out giving it one more day before i head to my pcp air conditioning in the rooms was a major problem for me they turn it off at night and this to me is completely unacceptable i didn?? pay for partial air i had my air on the snow flakes icon and it never rose above 80 degrees do you know how hot , sticky , and humid it gets in punta cana maintenance had to be called 3 times to my room , but it did no good since the problem is they turn it off at night ( lol ) personally speaking , i don?? go on vacation to sweat at the beach and in my room too so unless air not included in my rate ( which it is ) then please keep the air running throughout the night as well otherwise fully disclose this to guest prior to them booking , so they can choose if they would like to stay elsewhere and the mini bar was no better , doesn?? keep anything cold we didn?? bother using it since everything stayed so warm we just asked the housekeeper to bring ice in the room at turn down and we soaked our beverages there our room was pretty dated not sure where the million dollar renovation was done at , but it wasn?? done to the rooms or at least my room 4008 i had tons of rust at the base of the shower and in the jacuzzi the shower head in my room broke as well on day 3 the maid just laid the head on the shower floor and we just made due with this for the rest of the week while the room was musty at first , i brought my fbreeze plug in and that did the trick so no complaints on the odors housekeeping was very inconsistent only got face towels on the first day everyday after that , i had to call to request them not quite sure what the problem is , but another minor issue that needs to be fixed we?? get several big towels just no face towels i even went looking on the maids cart to avoid having to call again , but the carts had no face towels either anniversary package : i emailed elvira several months ( as well as a week prior ) to confirm all the details of this it took 3 trips to concierge to finally get all our stuff two nights before we left guest the 3rd time requesting it was a charn however , a slight bummer considering we were celebrating our anniversary the day we arrived my thought would be : don?? offer an amenity if no one wants to follow through on it in conclusion , your vacation is what you make of it we made the best of it and therefore we had a nice time minus the hiccups i just don?? see how you can charge $300+ a night and not provide guest with consistent basic amenities such as face towels , a decent cooling system , etc i was just amazed at how these minor issues were even present at a resort like this so after all the phone calls and trips to the front desk to get things fixed , we felt it was too much of a hassle when paying these prices i?? rather deal with these problems ( if i have to ) by staying elsewhere , yet paying a 1/3 ( if not 1/2) the price 
excellente resort - welcome home what a wonderful experience from arriving at the resort and being welcomed home to check - out 11 days later absolutely no problems with anything as we had been at other excellence resorts , we were upgraded to a third floor room overlooking the cascading pools and mountains - unbelievable view ate at most of the restaurants and ate three times at agave , two times at toscano and two times at spice - great food had the couples beach massage by amarylis and santa - money well spent weather was beautiful and only sprinkled a few times it usually rained during the night domino , the sax/clarinet player , was amazing - also bought his two cd 's did horseback ride for the half hour and had a fun time met some great people and would like to say hi to mike/nancy , michelle/harry , allison/buzz , julie , jack , john and denise we had no problems with mosquitos as they sprayed every night we were able to deal with the vendors in front of the resort - just tell them what you will pay - they will either accept or deny shows were good - there was a lot of talent on the stage the staff was always polite and many remembered our names and even the chef came and spoke with us during our romantic dinner at chez isabelle - nice touch - thank you we loved the beach barbeques for lunch as well as the pizza being delivered poolside again , would recommend this resort to anyone with no reservations 
second time around just read the review from never again and had to write one myself we stayed from oct 24- nov 2 2008 and our luggage was held up too only thing is , as always we took a carry on with a change of outfits just in case our luggage was held up luggage was deliverd to our room the next night the staff could not have been more helpful even made calls to airline for us the first day aa from jfk we were here 15 months ago and find that since then the staff speaks better english then i speak spanish i found out that they even take english lessons the beach and ocean was beautiful the waves were never ending the lifeguards did a great job of keeping us from harm way by reminding us not to stray to far out as there were some strong rip currants there was a lot of garbage on the beach past the hotel and this was being cleaned up i think this was from the hurricane that had just been there a few weeks before also altragracia was always at hand with a drink and a smile thank youthe spa was great and so was the staff at night there was domingo - saxo to get you dancing all in all it was a great time and will go back again 
do not stay here just returned yesterday 11-01-08, we are still very sick everyone we spoke to was sick for some or all days of their stay here you will not be able to get out of the bathroom and the stomach pain is awful the food is not great nor even marginal , it would be very difficult to describe the beef as beef everyone on the plane home could not wait to get good food the staff was very friendly and seemed willing to assist the air conditioning is poor and it goes off in the middle of the night the electricity in our room went out 5-8 times every day we would know because many times we were not well enough to leave the room a couple we meet there went for 4 days and could not get out of their room for 3 they both lost 6 lbs each the resort looks beautiful , but if you are sick or not feeling well the entire stay it is not enjoyable 
excellence was excellente this place just fantastic i went there with my new wife on our honeymoon and everything was great the staff was amazing , the food was frist class i do not think i ate anything that i would not eat again everything tasted wonderful even the room service food was exceptional pedro , who works at the bar near the pools with a waterfull , was amazing he remembered the drink that i always ordered and was always friendly when he saw me all of the scenery and shrubs were always kept up and looking great i reccommend taking advantage of the nightly shows and entertainment there were only 2 negative things that we encountered the first was that the bed was not as nice as expected it did not have box springs and you could tell that the mattress was pretty old as there were 2 body imprints we were really hoping for newer and more comfortable beds the other thing that we did like as much was that this resort was far away from any real city so going into the city and just bartering with locals and spending the day on the town was out of the question but , if you are planning on your honeymoon or vacation to just get away , relax and enjoy the sun , drinks and excellent food , then this place was amazing i would definitely go back 
stayed at the excellence from october 24th to october 28th our luggage was delayed the hotel was aware of this when we checked in we were not allowed in the restaurants for dinner because my husband did not have long pants we sat in our room for 2 days spent $102 00 on toothpaste , toothbrushes , bathsuit , suntan lotion etc it was not the excellence fault that our lugguge was delayed , but at least help us feel comfortable conicierge was going to keep track of where our luggage was , they never did she was so rude to us trying to communicate with the staff was difficulty because no one spoke english once they have your money , they really do not care i would not recommend this property 
loved every minute my wife and i stayed at the excellence from oct 15-22 we were celebrating our 25th anniversary but had never been on an overseas trip together so we really did not know what to expect we had talked to family  friends who had been to the dr and did much research into the resort on trip advisor thank the lord , we could not have planned a nicer trip we loved every minute and would go back to the excellence in a heartbeat if we could all the reviews we read had prepared us for the trip from the airport to the resort the roads were very bumpy but our driver from coco tours did a nice job of avoiding as many potholes as he could remember to take your bonine if you are susceptible to car sickness driving through the countryside was interesting my wife and i both were thinking to ourselves that we might have made a mistake in our destination choice until we entered the gates at the excellence we had stopped on the way to the excellence at a couple of other resorts to drop other couples off and those resorts did not even compare to the excellence the grounds at the excellence were beautiful and well kept you were greeted by friendly faces w/ a cold cloth and drink then we were guided to the folks at the excellence club we did have the excellence club package and thought that it was worth it you could get food or drink there all day if you preferred ricardo , johan , ana , roberto , magdilina and carlos were really our family for the week their help with some problems we had w/ expedia excursions was much appreciated they could not do enough to make your stay excellente it was such a nice touch to have a prepared bubble bath awaiting us when we returned to our room after dinner on our last night there all the staff members were courteous and helpful and always greeted you with a smile our room was great spacious enough for two and had a nice little patio and hammock in the yard with the high bushes you still had your privacy the room was clean , and cool , the bed was comfortable at the excellence you can do as much or as little as you want there are plenty of daily activities my wife and i were there to celebrate a second honeymoon and to be together , enjoy each other and relax this was the perfect place for it as i said the grounds were beautiful with many different kinds of flowers dotting the walking paths birds and butterflies were everywhere the beach was great and big enough so that you could find your own quiet place to chill the water was warm and a little rough but as was stated in the other reviews , you could go down the beach to the right around the bend a little way and wade out into a calmer area my wife and i did this on a few occassions and had the area all to ourselves the pool was spacious and well kept it seemed like most of the people stayed by the pool during our week yes , you did have to get up early to get the best spots and the floating rafts we never had a problem with towels as we would go to the excellence club and get them if there were none on the rack the weather could not have been more consistently beautiful (88 degrees with a refreshing breeze off the ocean ) nights were very comfortable the food was fine i am a bland person when it comes to food and not hard to please we really enjoyed the buffet breakfast at the toscana and the lasagna at the oregano most of our meals were in the toscana and the grill my wife enjoyed the different seafoods as well the food on the beach during lunch each day was great we did do one excursion (1/2 day safari ) and enjoyed watching how the coffee and cocoa were made the highlight was our 1/2 hour boogie boarding on a beautiful beach nearby overall , my wife and i have no complaints the excellence and whole experience was eveything and more that we had prayed for 
honeymoon from heaven my husband and i honeymooned at the excellence punta cana from 10/20/08 - 10/27/08 and had the time of our lives although most of the reviews on this site rave about the resort , the ones that do not had us a little worried prior to our arrival but , once we were there , we were blown away getting therewe reserved a private taxi ( $70 each way ) which was well worth it , as there were no stops the driver was holding a sign with my name at the airport which made it very easy to find him the ride took just over an hour , and the roads are really only bad in a couple of spots , and he would just go around the potholes it is not nearly as bad as some make it out to be of course , if you are on a bus , you may feel more bumps arrivalwow , we were very impressed upon entering the resort , you see a gorgeous lobby with water fountains , an open air veranda , and lots of comfy seating areas and beautiful colored glass decorations after checking in , we immediately went to the concierge to start booking some of our honeymoon package items we worked mostly with yousaury , who was super friendly and attentive and made us feel as though we were the only guests at the resort roomwe had an oceanview honeymoon suite on the 2nd floor in building 14 the room was beautiful and the bed was really comfortable my husband is a pilot and usually has trouble sleeping in hotel beds , but he slept well the whole week we had a couple of minor maintenance issues during the week , and when i reported them to the front desk , they were fixed by the time we came back to the room we were impressed to see that the hotel staff called our room to make sure we were satisfied amenitieswe did not stay as part of the excellence club , but we did not really feel the need we felt like superstars regardless the grounds were beautiful , the pools amazing - the swim - up bar was the place to be - and the beach was well maintained we also spent some time at the spa , which was awesome excursions/activitieswe paid for the oceanfront couples massage , and although it was a bit pricey , the ambience could not be beat it was sunset , there was an ocean breeze , and at the end of the hour , we were greeted with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries it was an euphoric feeling in that moment - groggy from the great massage , the ocean waves crashing , and the chocolate melting in your mouth we also spent some time at the sports bar playing ping pong and tennis it was nice to spend a little time away from the pool and the beach we did the biking and horseback riding , which were included in the package , and then we paid extra for the zip line tour and the scuba outing to catalina island both were really fun and well worth the money as part of the honeymoon package we also did the private dinner on the beach which was so romantic we were served lobster and steak , the waitstaff was amazing , and since it was also my birthday that day , the awesome yousary from the concierge desk surprised us with a birthday cake also , the trio of guitars/singers were terrific and sang us a love song in spanish foodthis was another area where some of the reviews had us worried we ate dinner at every restaurant except the grill and agave ( since we live in tx and figured we could get steak and mexican food at home ) and were happy with all of them , although chez isabelle , barcelona , and toscana were our top 3 the lobster house was really good too peoplethe best thing about this resort was the staff they were all friendly and helpful and made this trip so memorable for us however , we would like to recognize a few that we felt went above and beyond for us : yousaury - after check - in , yousaury was the first person with whom we met there was a little confusion over the honeymoon package and yousaury sorted it out for us , the smile never leaving her face instead of this issue turning into something that got our week off to a bad start , her professionalism and friendliness made us knew that everything would work out we felt like she really cared about us she personally followed up with a phone call on a few maintenance items with the room ( which were fixed immediately ) also , my husband secretly worked with yousaury to plan my birthday surprise we came back to the room on my birthday after hanging by the pool to find the room decorated with balloons , a sign saying happy birthday kristine on the headboard , and a card made on the computer by yousary and the cake that she arranged during our beachfront dinner was a surprise even to my husband the next day she called our room to make sure my birthday had gone well she was just a wonderful person to work with and made our trip even more special franklin  manuel - franklin and manuel work in the dive center and are the scuba instructors my husband is certified , but our trip was my first diving excursion we did a training session with manuel in the pool and he is so friendly and fun , he made me feel like everything was going to be okay they day of the trip , my husband did the first dive with the advanced group , while i was in the beginner 's group with franklin and manuel when i first went down , my ear hurt really bad and i came up i was afraid i would not be able to dive at all franklin came back up and gave me some pointers and encouraged me to try again he stayed by my side until we were down the rope and then had manuel hold my hand the entire dive (40 min ) they could see how nervous i was and went out of their way to make sure i felt safe and secure my husband ( a former marine , who has dove all over the world ) spoke with franklin before the dive he could tell that franklin was a world class professional he would never have left me on my first dive if he was not absolutely certain that i was in good hands he told them both to take care of his mi amore and they certainly did they also made the bus and boat rides there and back tons of fun with the music and dancing they are two stand - up guys who are the perfect balance between professionalism and fun elisa - great volley ball hostess after playing many games on the sand with us , while we were all tired and sand covered , she would run and get us all water with out being asked she was very fun to be around and a great help on the courts and at the shows very friendly and eager to say hello to us what a great representative for the resort winey - from his spanish lessons early in the morning , to his time on the volleyball courts , from his work on stage late at night with the shows , his great personality and friendly smile always made us feel welcome a very hard worker and a genuine person morales - very regal , professional , and discrete - the perfect face for the resort he works behind that check in counter and takes care of any problem that might need to be handled it was a pleasure to work with him 
not a bad word to say about the excellence my husband and i stayed at the excellence for the first time from 6-13 oct 2008 we absolutely loved the hotel , and thought the staff were wonderful our room was airy , clean and bigger than we were expecting the excellence club was definitely worth doing for access to beach towels , good seats by the pool , internet access and the excellence lounge we had no complaints about the food , though would say that the grill was our least favourite restaurant agave was great , as was toscana we were so impressed with how happy the staff all seemed , and consequently at the quality of the service which they provided next year we 're going back for 2 weeks 
pig with lipstick my wife had a $15,000 piece of jewlry stolen from our room the staff was not helpful and rude i would not recommend this property it is beautiful , but comes with a steep cost considering the theft a pig dressed up with lipstick is still a pig 
loved domingo my stay at excellnce was the best all around caribbean vacation ever i have been in the caribean at various spots in excess of a dozen times the saxofonist domingo was the best artist i have ever had the pleasure to listen to he was a very friendly and warm man , that made you want to see more of him each night seconly and certainly up there with domingo was our vip vacation rep jonathon he truely wants to help you have a great time and was very wam as well now for the resort itself , the food was out of this world good the wait staff attentive and friendly the actual structures and surroundings showed a bit of ware , but they probably are booked pretty full most of the time because this was a value vacation , and it probably is hard to keep up with everything in what is a very large complex did i mention the pools oh my god they are huge and seemingly endless we just loved them the week we were there the ocean was a bit rough but we were still able to enjoy the well groomed beach i am recommending this vacation spot to all my friends and feel confident they will love it as much as we did do not miss doming 's nightly sets they were perfect relaxation after a perfect meal 
my husband and i just returned from our 20th anniversary stay at the excellence resort october 18 - 25, 2008 we 've been to a few places and generally like to try a different location/resort every time but this is the first time we have sworn to go back i want to touch on a few points that other people do not seem to mention too much about we booked through travelocity which i would not do again i originally booked at dreams resort and then decided to switch within a day or two after reading some reviews and realizing that there would be a fair amount of children there they were not flexible ( even though i had trip insurance ) and charged me a huge fee to change our transportation was through prieto tours to and from the hotel and i would definitely recommend them the roads are bumpy and its a long ride and the traffic is straight out of the romancing the stone however , the buses were full size buses and well air conditioned i did not feel it was nearly as bad as i had read in reviews if you do want to comment on that , i would suggest pressuring the hotels because as i understand it , they are responsible for the roads that come directly to the resort area and you will notice the roads closest to the airport ( federally funded i believe ) are no worse than any other carribean country we stayed in your standard garden variety room ( no pun intended ) and were told it would overlook the mountains , garden or pool we had a beautiful pool view and while it 's a large resort we found the grounds pretty easy to get around there are many restaurants and bars and thus many dining choices we thought all of the restaurants were absolutely great we had favorite meals but never one that was bad even the cook outs on the beach were great the resort is large but is arranged along a large span of beach rather than having a small beach and the resort go deep back in so that guests have a long way to walk to the beach we really liked this and appreciated easy access to a large beach with soft clean sand the resort was very clean and we noticed that the staff was always working on cleaning bottoms of chairs , plants , corners , you name it our tile flooring was mopped everyday and we requested new sheets a few times because we dragged sand into our bed on our feet we had two or three nights where our room was decked out in towel animals and rose petals overall , i thought the dominican people were nicer and harder working than anywhere we have been the staff was so helpful and happy the level of poverty that you witness outside the resort is pretty dramatic you never feel pressured to tip but you will want to for fun we did the zipline adventure very worth it the rest of the time we indulged in resort activities we took advantage of the free horse back riding ( they say one ride is included but we did it 3 days and were not charged ) we did yoga classes and a free water therapy in the spa lots to do even if you do not want to spend more money on massages , etc if you do want that , it 's not cheap but they have daily specials we never had difficulty finding chairs and ideal spots by the pool or beach no resort ever has enough floating mats to make everyone happy but we did not have problems finding them or finding a person who would let us take theirs and we are not folks who get to the pool much before noon the gym and exercise class room are fabulous clean , good smelling , luxurious , etc all in all , an excellent value and the most romantic place i 've ever visited 
everything about this resort was certainly excellent just as the name implies we were greeted with champagne and cool towels for our face luxury everywhere and felt very spoiled for a week all the help were anxious to please and very friendly many restaurant choices and bars abundant loved the poolside beds and bar certain people need to be recognized although all were great juan carlos and eliz from the entertainment team , a fabulous waiter , kevin , vidal morales , head of the bell boys , and last but not least victor the restaurant manager kudos for the whole excellence team thank you for a great relaxing vacation 
another excellent holiday we stayed at excellence punta cana for 16 days (27 september to 13 october ) and had a wonderful time it was already our 4th time at this hotel and we just can?? seem to get enough of it throughout the years we have seen some changes and would therefore like to give our comments to our holidays : we had a garden view room on the 2nd floor the room was cleaned everyday and the maid would also place flowers in the room from time to time the minibar was refilled everyday and there was really nothing we could complain about the room foodduring our stay the menus at agave and chez isabelle were changed agave has always been our favourite restaurant , as we love the ambiance in the inner court of that building , which makes you feel like being in a mexican hacienda we loved the new dishes in agave even more and think the menu has improved a lot on the other hand , we were a bit disappointed to find the chateaubriand being taken out of the chez isabelle menu as this has over the years always been our very favourite dish we can clearly say that agave is our favourite restaurant , followed by toscana , which has great food as well my boyfriend would die for the tartufo steak and the pasta they do is very good as well oregano does great pizzas and you also find good food in the grill and the spice ( even though we are not so much into asian food ) we did not visit lobster and barcelona overall we can clearly state that we love the food at excellence , be it for breakfast , lunch or dinner and honestly speaking we cannot understand how somebody would not like the food we have also met the executive chef a couple of times he is german and he always came over for a little chat in german we think he does a great job drinksyou get everything you want and they do not save with the alcohol try the drink of the day it is always a highlight also if you are a beer drinker you will not be disappointed they have local beers like presidente and the numero 1, which is said to be the dominican corona and they are both very good the surroundingsthe beach is just great and one of the reasons we always return to that hotel the sea was pretty crazy in the first couple of days and you were not allowed too far out but when you think about people drinking alcohol already from the early mornings , it was only good that they would not allow you out also the whole hotel area looks very nice and they have made a new jogging path with a lot of different plants to see it looked beautiful entertainmentthe entertainment shows at night are still more or less the same as last year so we have seen most of it already , even though we must say we could make out slight changes in the programmes they are okay , but our favourite is still the perfect couple show , which is just so funny the casino was closed in the second week due to renovation work , which was probably better , so we did not spend too much money there and had more left to buy souvenirs staffthe staff at excellence is certainly the hotel?? biggest asset they really do everything to make you comfortable and lots of the people recognized us again you will not go anywhere without receiving a smile or a ??ola? we would especially like to mention antonia , who has been our favourite waitress for lunch throughout the years unfortunately , this time we did not see her a lot , but she would always come to say a few words to us the waiters at the bars do a great job and they are always ready for a joke domingo , daniel , altagracia and kenny to mention just a few , but our very favourite is still jos? who would always made us laugh last but definitely not least we would like to comment on the entertainment team we have spent a lot of time with them and to us they are like friends they are all working long hours , starting early in the morning and finishing at around 1 am in the disco julio , who is now supervisor always seemed to be around he is working very hard and did not have a break for ages also joel and juan carlos did a great job keeping everybody entertained but the biggest thank you must go out to the girls , which made us laugh everyday ines , who was the first to convince my boyfriend to dance merengue ( after one and a half week ) elisa , who has just started recently as an animator , but did an excellent job most special to us were however ??ama mariel? she recognized us immediately on the day of our arrival she just had a baby 4 months ago , and only sees her baby son , who is by the way very cute , every two weeks or so ask her about him , she will be glad to show you pictures finally , there was johanna , where my boyfriend is still impressed on how good she is at dancing it was mainly these two that made it possible that my boyfriend in the meantime understands a lot of spanish as they would only talk to him in spanish it was very hard to say goodbye to them lot and we hope to see them again at some stage overall , we had again a great time at excellence and hope to be back sooner or later 
loved the staff and resort perfect honeymoon/vacation i just want to start off by saying a special thank you to our wedding co - ordinator lisbeth , who setup a magical and special ceremony for us and provided us with something we will never forget she is a very sweet and helpful person who will go the distance in making your wedding day special i would also like to give mariel a special thanks , who helps out with the entertainment at the resort she is a fun and sweet person who knows how to get the fun out of you whether it was volleyball on the beach , or dancing at the disco tech , she was always around sparking a great time and a fun enviroment she made our honeymoon/vacation very fun and memorable as far as the rest of he staff and resort , we have never had such kind people cater to us like this resort has done for us the staff was wonderful and the resort provided teriffic food , especially at these restaurants , chez abbelle , barcelona , and toscana the beach and pools were very relaxing everyday at this resort , there is something new to do , from water sports , to horseback riding , to atv riding it was fun there is also a drink of the day everyday and nightly shows in the lounge ( which i have heard are the best in all of punta cana ) my favorite drinks there were coco loco and dirty monkey the coco loco is a real coconut and the bartender will chop an opening on the top right in front of you and make a drink from the coconut milk , it is delicious but do not have more than 3 or 4 or else you will be in the bathroom for the rest of the day ) if you like bananas and chocolate the dirty monkey is your drink in a nut shell i highly recommend this resort it is perfect for couples and relaxing i will definitely go back 
exceeded our high standards i am not one to write reviews about anything but i feel obligated to in this case my wife and i have stayed in ritz carlton 's , the venetian in las vegas , and other high - end resorts this was the nicest resort we have ever been to i wo not repeat all of the same info that others have but here are a few tips for people that are okay spending a few extra bucks to make the vacation perfect 1) excellence club - the people that choose this option love it and the people that do not say it is not worth it we chose it and loved it the biggest benefit is that there are always plenty of chairs on the beach and pool if you are not in excellence club , you may have to wake up early to get a good spot also , you get access to an actual club that gives you free food and drinks whenever you want and good , reliable , free internet to us , it was nice to be able to check email or grab a quick snack without walking all the way to the restaurants we also got large flat - screen plasma tv 's and we heard that other rooms had regular 19 tv 's 2) casino - we booked this resort because we like to gamble they apparently sent out a note to all travel agents that the casino is closed for construction never told us about it as it turns out , the inside secret is that when they are not busy , they close the casino and shuttle you next door to the sirenis resort to use their casino we were disappointed at first but it was not a big deal to take their shuttle it is about two minutes away there is no telling when they will re - open you get a different answer from everyone you ask 3) safety - not an issue everything is guarded very well and your safety is not an issue 4) airport transfers - it takes about an hour and 15 minutes if you go direct from the airport to the resort most shuttles seemed to stop at multiple hotels it is kind of a drag if you have some money , we found out that a lot of people use a service called helidosa to take a hellicopter from the airport directly to the hotel you get a scenic tour of the island and you get to your resort in 15 minutes it was about $200 each way 5) food - very few things blew us away as the best we had ever eaten but very few things were not good either we were really happy with the food in general 6) room types - you may want to request a certain floor to be on there are three floors throughout the property the first floor is right at the pool you have no privacy at all i suggest a second floor room if you can get it 7) sports bar - this is more of a bar that you can play sports at than it is a sports bar there are two tv 's the network stations are mostly out of denver this resort is a great value and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet , romantic place to get away it is full of honeymooners 
call it fair not excellence we went to this resort during the week of october 11, 2008 we had reserved a prestige limo service prior to our departure to bring us to the resort although expensive , the ride was worth it as it takes approximately 75 minutes to get to the resort from the airport the ride can be quite bumpy at times as there are a lot of potholes on part of the road once we got to the resort , we were greeted with the cold towel and some bubbly wine and then directed to the excellence club we were then brought to our room which was a junior suite swim up room the room is spacious and provides good living space although the bathroom is fairly small and the shower space is quite limited overall the resort is well maintained and clean the beach is huge and spectacular with lots of room to sit and enjoy the weather as mentioned in other reviews , the sea is quite rough the pool area has also a lot of room and is quite well maintained by the staff the only bad issue is that people go out early in the morning and reserve chairs and floating mattresses preventing people to have access to those during the course of the day food wise , the menu is at best average the only restaurant we did not eat at is the lobster house we tried all the other ones and i would rate the food being fair at best as far as i am concerned , i tried the steak in two places and both times , it was served almost raw and very bad tasting the other plates were sometimes bland and tasted nothing on the other hand , service was appropriate and charming on the entertainment side , although the shows cannot be compared to vegas , we thought they were quite good and quite entertaining we mostly enjoyed the jackson imitation and the circus during the day , although we just witnessed it as we were at the other side of the resort , it seemed as well that staff were entertaining the guests in quite a dligent fashion we think the excellence club was a good choice rather than going to the restaurants at lunch , we went to the club to pick up some pasta and cold meat and eat in our room or on the balcony we though it was better than to get dressed and go out the excellence club also serves a continental breakfast with a limited choice of hot food furthermore , the excellence club also provides you with a concierge service to book activities and to seek information overall , our experience was good except for the food mosquitoes were also a problem mostly at night and the were quite ferocious temperature was excellent and other than the first day , rain mostly happened at night tiles are rather slippery when wet so you have to be careful quite a pleasing experience but we would favor a buffet style dinner at one of the restaurants service from the staff is excellent overall tippng when you get superior service is well appreciated we had to request the maid at various occasion to supply us with towels and washcloths 
same time next year my wife and i stayed at excellence from sept 19 thru the 29th we were there the same week a year earlier and look forward to another visit the same time next year we had such a wonderful time last year that once booked , i worried that this year could not live up to last year i had nothing to worry about the trip from the airport is always an adventure the ride from the airport was much worse this year than it was last year hopefully they will complete the new road sometime soon upon arrival , the bellhop francisco remembered us from last year and gave us a huge welcome home we arrived at excellence just past noon check - in was easy but our room was not ready we went to toscana for lunch and by the time we were done , so was our room after a quick unpack , we were off to the ocean the beach and ocean are magnificent at excellence the water is very rough , so if you are looking for calm seas , this may not be the place for you there were plenty of chairs and towels and we had a waiter right away always good drinks from sol bar while relaxing on the beach , i saw a gentleman looking our way and thought i recognized him he came over and asked us if we were at excellence exactly one year earlier i told him we were and although we did not meet last year , we remember each other it was none other than the flip flop man you probably already read his review he and i had conversations daily about excellence and about the trip advisor he is very well traveled and quite a character after basking in the sun for about three hours , we ventured next door to walmart to see our friend jose there is a group of vendors just off the property and they are alot of fun yes they are pushy until you get to know them , but once you do , there are great deals to be had we bought some larimar and some other trinkets every day we had some mammawanna and a cuban cigar lots of fun the food last year was good but it did have an after - taste this year the food was excellent whatever made the strange taste was gone i think it was a certain type of oil that they used we constantly ran in to the head chef for the resort he even sat us at a table when the hostess was busy we gave him rave reviews on our meals we ate at the lobster house twice it is rock lobster , not maine so there is a different taste and no claws they serve the lobster with mashed potatoes i asked if they had baked potatoes and the waiter told me that they do not make baked at the lobster house but he would run next door to the the grill and get me a baked potato the staff would go out of there way at any point to make you happy sometimes there is a little language barrier , but that is half the fun trying to get what you want they always bring it with a smile another guest complained about a certain sauce that was on their meal , so i asked if they just re - ordered and got it the way they wanted they did not and were not happy with their meal the staff at excellence will bring you a dozen meals if need be if you have a problem with your meal , let them know how they can make it better and they will do whatever it takes we ate at spice three times we always had the pad tai noodles and the fried rice with every meal along with some entree very good dinners chez isabel also saw us three times the beef was amazing and we also got an order of coquelle each time we ate at the grill just once , but the beef melted in your mouth we would have gone back , but we ran out of days we ate at barcelona once it was good , but some of the other restaurants were just better we had breakfast in toscana every morning i had a fresh omlet and my wife ate mostly fruit for breakfast there was always plenty of fresh juice and champagne if you wanted a glass after dinner every night , we had drinks and listened to domingo he is an amazing sax player after domingo , the shows started it is not vegas , but some are entertaining the grounds are absolutely amazing at excellence they are constantly working and the place is beautiful the pool seems to go on forever the layout of the resort is great because it goes along the ocean , not away from it it gives the resort a tremendous amount of beach frontage because there is sooo much beach and the pool that seems to never end , you really are not all crowded together we stayed at another resort in bavaro this spring the pool was small and the buildings are built going away from the beach the people were just on top of one another i think it says alot that as we were leaving , our thought was same time next yearthere were a few minor issues there were more bugs this year and the maid service seemed to be a little inconsistant nothing that would ruin my trip or keep me from returning we even had two and a half days of rain i guess it just kept us from getting too much sun overall , our trip was great and we think a tremendous value 
wonderful - excellente just returned from our trip to excellence and i 'm not sure what everyone is complaining about if you did not have a great time or thought the food was awful then you do not know how to enjoy things you are always going to have things that come up on a vacation but you make the most of it and get on with enjoying life we had a great time october 11-18th first of all , get over the trip from the airport to the hotel yeah it is 1 hour , the roads are not as bad as everyone says , when you live in the midwest like me , after a rough winter the potholes are worse than the roads in the dr and the drivers know where the problems are and do their best to avoid them we asked the driver to stop and get beer and he was more than willing to do so and it made the ride fun get to know the people on the ride with you and it makes it easier check in was quick , and painless the rooms are more than adequate and very clean , as are the grounds the staff was always willing to accomodate our needs we did have a problem with the air conditioning in the room but the staff was their to work on it and was willing to switch our rooms if it was not to our satisfaction remember it is very hot and no matter how hard the air works , it is not going to be cold in the room and it is still very humid in the rooms one thing also is the flowers in the room are a nice touch daily but they are why the ants are in the room remove the fresh cut flowers around the sinks immediately and you wo not have problems with the ants we did not have to use bug spray at all they fog the grounds in the evening daily and we got maybe one bug bite the entire 7 days never had to wait more than 10 minutes for seating at dinner in any locations we did have a waiter accidently spill on my husband at dinner but the resort paid for laundry service without hesitations there is always something to do or eat if you so choose to those who find things to really complain about need to learn to relax and enjoy what they have the shows are really not professional quality but they are entertaining and if you do not want to watch leave and find something else to do this was a great trip and we meet lots of fun and interesting people i would go back to excellence again maybe not to punta cana but to other resorts they offer we have already contacted our agent for quotes 
will definitely return my husband and i , and a couple that are friends stayed at excellence 9/26 to 10/04, and we had a wonderful time we have stayed 2 times at erc , and found them different , but the same we were upgraded this time to an excellence ov , since we had booked the master suites , and they were undergoing refurbishment all the restaurants we ate in were good , we liked chez izabelle the best and agave the least we did not try the lobster house service was excellent from everyone it is a very romantic place we had the anniversary package , which is complimentary , and it was really nice our only complaint about this resort was that they had vendors on property 3 nights we do not mind vendors 1 night , but 3 was just pushing all my buttons if you wanted to shop vendors , they are within walking distance down the beach the beach is nice , but the water was black flagged every day we were there we love to sit on the beach and watch the people in the water , and look for boats , but there was none of this happening the mosquitos were pretty bad at night , off worked for me and my friend , the men did not seem to be bothered , though one thing we missed on resort was a wandering photographer we have stayed at many resorts and this is the only one that did not have a photographer around taking pictures it has become sort of a tradition for us to buy one of the pictures as a souvenir again , everything was wonderful and i can answer any questions you may have 
oh , i so want to give the excellence a 5- star review - but it fell just short in all areas let me start by addressing my main concerns , some of which have no bearing on the resort itself first , the ride to the hotel yes , it is long - 1 hour and 10 minutes our driver on arrival should be nicknamed the artful dodger because he manuevered around the potholes and numerous scooters with artistry since we did not opt for any excersions , we knew from reading previous reviews to treat this journery as our excersion sure , it is bumpy - but no bumpier than a new england back road i had no problem at all with nausea and neither did anyone else on our tour bus try to finagle a front seat on the bus and you will be fine on our return trip , just to test this theory , we sat in the back seat and it was much bumpier , but we were still fine we actually ended up enjoying the ride secondly , the mosquitoes i tend to be a blood donor for the local mosquito population at home in the summertime , so i was expecting the worst i got a grand total of 3 bites and half the time i forgot to put on the deep woods off thirdly , the weather the weather channel outlook for the week had 80% chance of storms or showers each day , it looked pretty grim in actuality , it rained for a total of about 2 hours during our 6 day stay ignore the weather forcasts , its a tropical climate and from time to time there 's a storm or a shower lastly , i was worried from quite a few reviewers about getting ill from the food my husband and i were both completely healthy the entire time , and did not hear of anyone else who got sick either our room was lovely , we had an excellence club junior suite ocean view swimout room the maid service was spotty , some days the room was not done until 4:00 we had broken glass in our slider door that took two days to replace and the jacuzzi - the knobs on ours were broken ( fell off in my hand when i turned on the water ) , and when the people upstairs used theirs it began to rain in our room now , on to the food in most cases , really good - just not great beware of items not being what they are described on the menu for example , in spice , my shrimp tendon was described as shrimp and vegetable tempura - but the only vegetables on the plate were the parsely garnish this happened quite a few times and actually got to be a joke with us we ate at all restaurants except the french one we did not like the grill at all we both ordered steaks and they are not char - grilled like we are accustomed to it is a flat fry grill and they pour gravy on top of the steaks ( to create flavor all other restaurants , breakfast , lunch and dinners were really good now on to the property this place is a paradise take time to walk around and explore , especially the eco park ( please feed the 3 baby ducks for me the bridges in this park are in need of repair , and watch out for the attack geese - my husband got bitten in the ankles if you take the bike tour , it is not much of a tour the bikes need to be replaced , my husband 's chain kept falling off the guide takes you off the property , around the back of the resort to a horse ranch - where there 's a gift shop ( how convenient ) you are escorted to same thing with the horseback ride ( which is great ) , but at they end they try to sell you a fuzzy picture of yourself and a cigar for $35 the excellence club is well worth it our our view robert is great one last thing that disturbed me that i was not expecting the alcohol flows very freely here in the late afternoon people got quite loud ( and in some cases obnoxious ) in several pool areas funny at first , but after 6 days it gets old i ca not for the life of me figure out why you would spend this much money on a vacation and spend your time drinking yourself into oblivion so , to sum this up - do not hesitate to go to excellence , it is a wonderful vacation spot we vacationed at another all - inclusive in mexico that really was 5- star , and the excellence falls just short of that 
the most amazing trip ever this resort exceeded our expectations by a long shot - and that was after we had read all of the favourable reviews on this site the excellence is truly a 5 star resort - your every need is catered to , and in fact , anticipated ( before you even knew it existed the pool is the most beautiful we have ever seen , and the service was simply beyond any expectations we could ever have had the rooms are beautiful ( although not as beautiful as the ones at the majestic ) , the beach is breath - taking be aware , however , that it is really not a good idea to swim in the ocean at this resort the beach is almost always either closed ( black flagged ) or marked as dangerous ( red flagged ) very few venture into the waters but surprisingly , it did not take away from the trip at all ( and we are ocean lovers i highly , highly recommend this resort - we are in fact planning our honeymoon here for next year 
the perfect honeymoon excellence punta cana is truly the perfect , relaxing get - away we went on our honeymoon august 2008 and had the holiday of a lifetime the hotel itself is absolutely stunning , set on a idylic beach complete with hammocks and palm trees from the moment you arrive , you are treated to pure luxury , and the rooms are beautiful , four poster bed and jacuzzi included the choice in restaurants means there is something for everyone , i would reccommend 'spice ' which is chinese and thai cuisine but every one of the restaurants is worth a visit the entertainment was better than i expected , with a large theatre in the main building , it was always packed and had a good atmosphere the michael jackson tribute show should not be missed , along with the circus and magic show during the evening , there is music entertainment which includes a saxophone player and traditional dominican band the atmosphere throughout day and night is lively and friendly , but not noisy or imposing the casino is brilliant , and open until 3am the staff there are lovely , they ca not do enough for you and are all very friendly and helpful the drinks were flowing constantly with waiter service on both the beach and by the pool although there was plenty to do in the hotel , we did go on a dolphin swim excursion which was amazing worth doing and reasonably priced at only $120 ( ?60- ?70) per person we also booked the soana island trip as it was recommended to us by a friend but unfortunately it got cancelled due to the weather we also took part in quad biking on the beach ( at an extra cost of $80 or 2 hrs ) which was brilliant , a tour guide took us around the desserted beaches and through the local towns another must is the horse back riding on the beach , 1/2 hour free with your all inclusive package overall , i would say that this is the perfect romantic getaway or honeymoon had a fantastic time , despite a few bad days of weather due to hurricaines passing by and would go back in a flash top tip : take a good stock of mosquito spray/cream i was eaten alive and ended up having to have an injection to take the swelling down many guests experienced the same problem if you want everyday sunshine , i would suggest visiting outside of hurricaine season as we did loose a couple of days to wind and rain 
the punta cana excellence resort was a great vacation i would definitely suggest the private van from the airport ( price varies , $90 on way to resort/$80 on way back to airport ) on arrival we got the cold towel and champagne , and got quick check - in and bellhop got our bags to our room right away the room was very spacious and never had a problem w/our room during the days we enjoyed the beach in the a and the huge main pool in the afternoons the pool is really a great time w/a swim up bar and volleyball/water polo to help work up a thirst the event team was incredible ( mariel , ines , johanna , and carlos ) always got the games started and everyone involved we would see them everywhere and they treated us like we were long time friends the food was great at some and good at other places we were there 4 nights so i would rank the 4 dinner restaraunts as 1) spice 2) the grill 3) agave 4) chez isebelle the grill was great for lunch as well and toscano was good for breakfast and lunch the casino was closed for our entire stay due to renovations , so night life was slim pickings except for the disco and sports bar ( look for lucas ) but that even closes early at 11:00pm overall the trip was excellent and we would definitely go back 
this is not a five star resort this was our second visit to punta cana we were very satisfied with the resort we selected last year however we chose a different , similarly rated resort this year we were disappointed first of all , the resort is a good 75 to 90 minutes from the airport - the 45/60 minutes they tell you in brochures is not true , owing to how bad the roads are , and the bus will make one or 2 stops at other resorts dropping passengers the resort?? website says 30 minutes at least one would reasonably expect to see a real gem off the beaten path the reception was very good ? the bellman offered us a glass of champagne and a cold cloth to refresh ourselves , and the resort did not require us to wear a bracelet when we got to our room , there was a very strong musty odour ? like if doors had not been open and room had been unoccupied for a long time we complained to the front desk but all they did was burn a long match to change the scent room is poorly lighted , making it difficult to read at night the mattress was average at best with no box spring underneath there was no security lock on our door while there was a deadbolt above the door handle , it opened when we inserted our regular key or when housekeeping or mini - bar staff inserted theirs the only privacy we could get was placing a do not disturb sign outside the door housekeeping was also average at best ? they would come in at different times each day and each day we had to call front desk for washcloths and hand towels the main eating area for breakfast and lunches ( the tuscana restaurant ) was without air conditioning for the first 3 days we were there we wonder what took so long to fix it ? the same length of time it took to fix a urinal adjacent to the restaurant overall we found food was generally bland choices were otherwise ok ( mostly ) when we went to the french restaurant , they did not have the appetizer and entree i wanted ( escargots and venison ) we checked again 3 days later and it was the same answer ? new menu , not everything is in yet they should not put it on the menu if they don?? have it on another occasion we went to the lobsterhouse restaurant lobster is their specialty but the steamer was not working that night we left and came back the following night the steamer was fixed but lobster was not as appetizing as what we are accustomed to the pools were very nice and the bars provided very good choice and service we did not find the beach very nice there was quite an elevation between the water and the beach chairs , and the sand harboured mosquitoes my wife was bitten badly from the calves down , although i hardly got bit myself we had not experienced mosquitoes at the other resort we visited last year finally , not a big deal but the resort?? website also does not tell you its casino is closed for renovations , although we did not see any renovation taking place the week we were there if you like to gamble , you will have to take a shuttle to the nearest hotel ? about 5 minutes to sum up , we did not consider the excellence a five star resort , although it is priced as such 
resort was paradise let me start off by saying that most of the negative parts of this review are due to circumstances that were beyond the resort 's control my husband and i went to excellence for our honeymoon from sept 29 - oct 6, 2008 the resort was paradise however , here were the negatives regarding our trip : 1 the drive to and from the airport - the other reviews are absolutely correct i did not want to believe them because i wanted to stay positive , but let me tell you - prepare yourself if you have never been to a country like this before , you are in for a surprise the roads are absolutely terrible and will make you sick if you have a weak stomach ( like i do ) keep in mind this also includes any excursions you plan to go on any excursions are at least an hour away from the resort , so you have to deal with that kinda of ride any time you leave the resort therefore , we only did one excursion - we went snorkeling one day - and in my opinion , it was not worth the trip there and back so , if you are looking to do alot of excursions , expect to travel far and uncomfortably otherwise , i would suggest staying at the resort the mosquitos are horrible the other reviews are correct about this factor as well it 's not just a few little itchy mosquito bites we are dealing with here i got eaten alive my legs were covered with bites and they itch uncontrolably if i had to stay another day dealing with mosquito bites , i would have gone crazy we brought lots of bug spray , but it didnt help one bit i was told that the mosquitos mostly came from being on the beach at night , so i refused to go on the beach at night after that so , no romantic walks on the beach at night for us the first 3 days we were there , we were not able to go in the ocean we did not even go on the beach for the first three days because we could not swim in the ocean , so we stayed by the pools so now for the positives : 1 the resort is absolutely amazing i have no doubt that this is one of the best resorts in punta cana i booked this resort when it was #1 on travel advisor , and i can see why it was #1 after a long day of travel ( we had a connection in miami international airport that was delayed 4 hours - which turned our travel time into 16 hours ) , and after a long trip from the airport to the hotel ( about 1 1/2 hour drive ) , we finally made it to the resort upon which , we were greeted with champagne and hot towels we went right up to our room which was beautiful the rooms are clean and large they clean every day , and turn down your bed at night they restock your mini - bar with whatever you want mini bar items are included we had a view of the ocean from our room it was great the food is outstanding the restaurants were absolutey fantastic we really loved the breakfast buffet and lunch buffet at toscana , and were pleasantly suprised at how good the food was the dinners were also wonderful , we especially loved agave ( the setting and the food was great ) and toscana the service was incredible the minute you called the front desk for a request , they took care of it immediately the staff was really efficient and friendly the pools are amazing there are two pools - a main pool , with a swim up bar , which is active and fun always pool activities going on and there is another pool - the cascade pool , which was more relaxing and soothing we opted to stay at the cascade pool most days , which has a bar also , ( not a swim up ) and we loved it we took naps and read our books , and layed in the pool and it was great i tried to be as honest and unbiased as possible again , the resort itself is simply wonderful it is just unfortunate that the mosquitos bothered me and the roads hindered us from doing anything outside of the resort 
loved it my husband and i have just returned from 6 nights at the excellence resort and had a wonderful time the resort is isolated , nothing to do outside the property , but everything is there that you need we found the entertainment a bit ho - hum , but the animation team is very friendly and always on hand to talk and liven things up the drinks are the best i 've seen at any all inclusive resort , the red wine they serve is one of my faves , and also the bubbly a very nice surprise also top shelf liquors and liqueurs , and a large selection are available the room was very nice , super clean and everything worked , our view was not that great but you get what you pay for and we did not spend much time in the room anyway the mosquitoes are horrendous so we probably would not have used the balcony had we had a view the food was quite good , but did not match up to the excellence of the rest of the resort the portobello salad in the mediterranean restaurant was the best food i had anywhere all week the beach was beautiful , but the water extremely rough and for the most part unsafe to be in , we saw the life guard go out twice to drag folk back in but just around the corner , an easy walk along a somewhat littered beach area is calmer water the pool is lovely and a great temperature to just hang around in and the floats make it all quite idyllic i found it a little frustrating to get to the bars which were on the other side of the pool which is long and thin and meanders across the resort ok if you do not mind getting wet and swimming across , but you 'd probably go to the swim up bar if that 's the case another bridge over to the other side would be useful all in all a beautiful , immaculately maintained resort which does not assault the eardrums with constant loud techno music lots of pleasant places to sit in the evenings when you 're all dressed up , and lots of choices of restaurants , no reservations needed i thought all the restaurants were about about the same as far as food goes if you decide to drive yourself , i highly recommend that you take the longer route via higuey to the resort from puj airport , the shorter route has a road that will give you nightmares all week , trust me on this one , email me for details if you 're considering hiring a car one last thing , it 's adults only , but unlike other resorts we have been to , there was nobody topless , so if that 's what you want and feel uncomfortable being the only one you might want to consider going somewhere else it did not stop me though and nobody seemed to object 
excellence at excellence i arrived at excellence with four of my co - workers on oct sure , the ride to the resort was an experience on its ' own however , we were in a different country , with a different economic crisis although the ride was different , not once was i afraid for my life or anyone elses life , on the road just because its new to us the tourist , does not mean that the locals do not know what they 're doing they do this work day in and day out give them credit for knowing how to drive in their own land i would 've been more afraid if i , or one of my countrymen were driving on the dominican republic roads greeted by a cool towel and a glass of champagne added to the ease of check in , with bellboys bringing all luggage to your room speaking of which , the three ladies in our group were initially placed in building 14, which was on the furthest edge of the resort and the furthest away from all the happenings our room was extremely musty , but the front desk accomodated us quite nicely and quickly by placing us in a different room which was closer to everything and had a pool view instead of a view of someone 's backyard both courteous and accomodating , matias , ibhar , pauline and the rest of the crew at the front desk were exceptional in assisting our group , even calling , more than once to see if we were satisfied with our new room and its location the entertainment was better than i expected , and what a blast on michael jackson night not an empty seat in the theater the entertainment crew , including joel , juan carlos , ines , meriel , johanna , luciano and many others whose names i do not know , were all outstanding in their duties to involve and entertain the guests job well done they were truly the fun of the resort , and i will remember each of them lots of great memories were created from top to bottom , i am thrilled with my stay at excellence there was nothing so detrimental during my stay that would keep me from returning the entire staff from entertainment , reception desk , bartenders/servers such as carlos , domingo , and hector , were just a joy and pleasure my first trip to punta cana has left me with such fond memories that i hope to return before the year 's end thank you to the entire excellence team for a very fun - filled memorable week i 'll miss all of you sincerely , victoria ( tori ) 
love the excellence we just returned from an excellent trip at this hotel my boyrfriend and i stayed from 10/04-10/10, 2008 we had an ocean view junior suite and stayed in building 14 we loved it room was very clean and had no problems with the air conditioning , and believe me it was hot and humid in the dominican the drive to the hotel , as you have probably read , was a little bumpy and they do drive fast although , it 's not much different than driving down the dan ryan in chicago for us we rented a private taxi highly recommended since they picked us up at the airport and drove us directly to the resort the cost was $70 00 one way , but it was just the two of us ( and the driver of course ) and it was an air conditioned car can you tell air conditioning is an issue for us we asked him to pick us up on our departure as well and he was there right when we asked him to be we booked the taxi directly through the hotel so just email the concierge desk and they 'll set it up for you easy as pie the resort itself is beautiful - there is no other way to describe it drinks were a plenty and they are strong i watched them make them and whoa - let me tell you they are not shy with the top shelf booze the food was very good - i 've been on two cruises and my boyfriend has been to different resorts in aruba , bahamas and mexico we both agreed the food was very good we never had a problem with anything the service at chez isabelle was top notch , the best we had at any restaurant we tried them all but the lobster house and oregano , although they served the pizza at the lunch buffet all were very good : - ) we did not do any excursions or even the free horse back riding - we enjoyed laying under our palapa or in the pool on the mats we also enjoyed the spa and their services it is expensive , but we love that sort of attention and relaxation overall it was a wonderful trip and we had a great time we went for total relaxation and it was exactly what we got we got room service every morning and once late at night - never a long wait and everything was good we did tip almost everywhere - i think we went through about $80 00 throughout the entire week not bad really and they are very appreciative of the dollar here and there it seemed you got the same service whether you tipped or not but we are big believers in tipping for good service the beach was always clean and the water is very rough if you are not a strong swimmer , i would not go past your waist - as i did not my boyfriend on the other hand did and had a ball in the large waves there was a lifeguard there but only where the flags are red , if it is black he will whistle for you to swim where it 's red flagged only the shows were good - michael jackson show , we thought would be pretty cheesy , but it was very entertaining we really enjoyed it we would both recommend this resort and hope to return one day i just do not really see how you could complain about this place of course everyone has their own taste but we are both upper middle class incomes and enjoy dining out and going to chicago for shows , dinners , shopping , etc this resort was right up there for us remember , you are in a very poor country , you are on vacation and your vacation is what you make of it one more thing - go see nancy at her shop to the left of the resort ( if you 're looking at the beach ) great prices , no hounding or following you around great for souveneirs that 's about it - if you have any questions , go ahead and contact me and i hope you will enjoy your stay as much as we did 
we are going back we origionally booked to stay at the serenis tropical spa resort , but when we arrived there , they told us we would have to be moved to another hotel as there was a problem with a number of rooms we were very upset as we were tired and had traveled from the u k on a nine hour flight the last thing we needed to be told they had to move us but how lucky were we to end up at the excellence resort , it was paradise , an adult only resort where nothing is too much trouble and you are treated as though you were the only guests , i personally cannot praise this resort enough rooms , food , entertainment , pool gardens and staff were second to none , can not wait to return with our friends for a couple of weeks in january 2009 
ok , yes the road to the resort is long and bumpy , however that has nothing to do with the resort itself we booked the excellence club and check in was very easy we pulled up to the breath taking resort and was greeted with a big smile our bags were taken for us and we were taken the excellence club at that point we were given a tour of the club and the manager explained to us everything about the resort we were then lead to out room in building 7 and were surpised to see we were upgraded for free to a swim up room the honeymoon banner was on the door , and the room was clean and had fresh flowers we were well stocked up with drinks and there was fresh fruit on the table our housekeeper kept the room spotless the whole week and we had turn down serive in the evening we spent most our time at the pool , for the water is not that clear in the ocean it was worth paying for the excellence club , for us since we used the free internet to keep contact with our children it was also nice just to grab a snack or sit out on the balcony to have your morning coffee the service that we received was wonderful the food was good , we loved the grill the shows were entertainging , and the staff was so helpful and friendly the customer service at the resort is the best yes , it is all exclusive however after i saw the great service that i was getting i wanted to tip bring a stack of ones we ended up giving out about $150 worth of tips during our stay , not because we need to , we wanted to we took a excursion , the outback safari and it was a good time the others on our trip that were staying at other hotels were saying they did not like dreams , i was thinking to myself glad i did not stay there we were sad to leave but will return bottom line excellence was everything i wished for and more we loved it 
perfect honeymoon spot punta cana excellence was a wonderful place to stay for our honeymoon the staff were great the tennis pro orlando was excellent and gave me many tips to improve my game so i can play now with my husband the staff in the restaurants and bars were attentive and excellent libeth was helpful in the dining room we got to meet the head chef who was very knowledgeable and gave us a history of the hotel we spoke with tony who manages/owner of the hotel and a very nice gentleman and attentive when we were talking with him we also had excellent bar service even though we are not drinkers who made us wonderful non - alcholic not too sweet drinks rafealla , elifet , and marino were excellent in the bar area , our maid in bulilding 7 on the second floor was awesome , and lucas in the sport area was very helpful thouroughly enjoyed our stay and john kaleda 
good , but not the best my wife and i stayed at excellence from 9/21-9/28 we had both good and bad experiences there we are in our late 30's and have travelled to several places including all - inclusives and cruises we took this trip for our 15th wedding anniversary yes , you have to pay $10 dollars per person when you get there someone told us that you have to pay $20 to leave but we never did we had a private transfer arranged through ibk it was just the two of us on the van that was big enough for 8 we skipped the porters and found them waiting for us our driver spoke limited english and we spoke limited spanish so there was not a lot of conversation on the ride this same guy picked us up on our day of departure , he was actually 30 minutes early picking us up weekend arrivals and departures are busier the roads leaving the airport and going to the hotel are not bad but the road between these two was kind of rough it did not seem as bad as everyone has said the ride took barely over an hour both ways arrival/check - in was strange it was like they did not know we were coming they had to hunt for wet towels , which we did not care about and it took them several minutes to find someone to get us the welcome drink the guy at the desk checking us in seemed distracted the whole time he was helping us , he kept calling different people on the phone our room was not ready , so we ended up eating lunch before heading up the room - when we arrived at the room our luggage had been delivered we were hoping/expecting flowers , fruit , and a banner for our anniversary but we did not get it during our stay no , we did not call because it was not a big deal , we just guessed that something got overlooked our room was an ocean view , which i do not suggest paying the extra money for we tried to book a swimout , which seemed like the best rooms to have , but there were none available at booking the amount of wash cloths and towels in your room upon arrival will not be the same later during the week we never ran out of bath towels but we seldom had hand towels or wash cloths if you want wash cloths during your stay , take some from the restrooms located next to the toscana or the one next to the martini bar they are replenished around 3-4pm our balcony door never locked and if you opened it , the air conditioner would not cut off like many have stated the maid or someone must have done something to the closet door during our stay because it closed when we first arrived but later during the week it would not close all the way i never knew what happend there we did have ants on our sink every day and the last two days we had some kind of bug that looked like roaches in the bathroom they would scurry when the lights were turned on the hotel - it is well taken care of , someone is constantly cleaning if it rains like it did on us be careful walking around on the tile floors between buildings i did ok walking in my flip flops but it was extremely slick in my running and dress shoes the pool and beach - they did a great job keeping everything clean around both we did experience some problems finding towels if you ca not find towels look at the club house or at the hut where they give diving lessons beside of the bar sol the main pool is kind of busy , the beach was not as busy , and the cascade pool was completely laid back this is where i would have liked to have a swim out room , building 1, 2, or 4 would have been great for us bar service around the main pool is hit and miss it seemed to be better around the sol bar than closer to cafe kafe most of the time i just went to the bar and had prompt service if you need food while you are at the pool , both of these bars have sandwiches and fruit in to go boxes they also have food at cielo , the bar next to the cascade pool at the beach we had one day where it was tough to figure out which chairs were empty we only got drink service on the beach once while we were there yes the water is rough in the ocean the food at the beach never seemed to be good to us the day that they made burgers , chicken , and sausages , we tried it and it all was under cooked note , when they tell you that they will be serving food at 12, they mean that they are going to start cooking it at 12 we only saw someone delivering pizza once during our stay if you want pizza/food , go to the toscana and ask for a box at the back of the restaraunt where they make the pizzas the bars and service during the shows - great service at all of them the only strange thing is the fact that you never knew what size or type of glass they were going to serve you in at the same bar you would get 3 different sized glasses for the same drink it was no big deal , just odd to tip or not to tip , i have no answer for you i generally tried to tip , but at the shows when i would tip one of the servers , they never came back , maybe i was not tipping enough if you sit at a bar very long and tip the bartender , you will not be able to walk a straight line when you leave the shows and entertainment crew - not the best i have seen and not the worst the crew seemed to try hard , they even made valiant attempts during the 2 5 days of rain to keep everyone entertained just remember this is a job to them , when it is time for them to get off work they do not want to hang out with you , they want/need to go rest we saw this at the disco one night the restaurants - chez isabelle , the french one , was ok it did not live up to the hype that everyone put into it our cream brulee was not smooth and creamy , it reminded me of rice pudding i think it was because it had been sitting in a warmer the service was a little lacking here agave , the mexican , was suprizingly good i had read some bad reviews and this was not the case with us the steak that i had there was impressive , slightly over cooked but very tender the service was over the top the grill was a real shock this was another restaurant that i had read bad reviews about i had the mixed grill because the server told me it was smaller portions , he lied it was generous portions and the beef was cooked perfectly the service was good here , not great but good 
excellence at the excellence have just retuned from a fantatsic holiday spent 14 nights , from 15-29th sep my partner and i have been to the caribbean three times before and travelled to other parts of the world , staying in five star hotels the excellence is not perfect , but what is the meaning of perfect , everybodys view is different we loved it beautiful sandy beach as mentioned in previous reviews , beach is unsuitable for swimming if you want to do lots of swimming , you would be best to go to other resort there are security guards on the areas of beach where you cant swim , stopping people swimming or going out to far on the area of beach where you can swim , life guards were present there are plenty of sun beds and shades very good choice of food , with seven resturants and room service to choose from , there is something for everyone , even for a fussy eater you would never go hungry at lunch , two resturants to choose from , room service , sandwiches and fruit at pool bars , pizza bought round to pool and beach daily lunch on the beach room service was limitied , but made a nice change if you fancied staying in we had room service breakfast twice when we had trips , we ordered the day before , arrived promptly at six clock as requested also had room service one evening , when we faniced just staying in staff at all resturants and bars , very friendly , always a smile on their faces , will do anything for you felix and juan at the sol pool bar , would wait on you at the pool or beach , always very helpful pools kept very clean , plenty of clean beach towels and floats and beds rooms kept very clean , clean towels etc every day flowers left in room , bath run , with floating petals , towel art etc mini bar stocked daily grounds very clean and well maintained , gardeners attending to grounds every day yes there were insects and i dont usually get bitten , but i did get bitten rather a lot i used insect repellent everyday and night , but still got bitten the hotel sprayed grounds four times a day and sprayed our room when i asked even though i got bitten and it rained for two days , we still had a great holiday and will return my partner and i dont usually go back to the same place as we like to try different places as there are so many other countries to visit , but we will be returning to the excellence either next year or the year after , i am sure of that , as we had such a fantanstic time 
excellence lived - up to its name we have just returned from a 7- night break at the excellence the hotel was magnificent - spacious with an enormous pool and some very nice architectural touches it was a bit remote - a taxi to the 'tourist ' shopping mall took almost an hour - but , as our main goal was to chill - out for a week , this was not an issue service was terrific throughout the resort all the staff were very friendly and anxious to please we paid a bit extra for the excellence club and it was worth every cent club members have access to a private lounge , which offers light refreshments all day as well as internet access the club manager ( roberto ) could not do enough to make our experience as relaxing and enjoyable as possible the hotel offers a wide choice of restaurants ( italian , french , mexican , asian , etc the food quality and waiter service in each was first - class indeed , the restaurants exceeded all our expectations and was a highlight of the vacation even the buffet breakfast was special with champagne and caviar available every day if that 's your thing the only disappointment was the spa while the services provided were decent , we thought they were pretty expensive there seemed to be plenty of massage rooms but the facilities generally ( e sauna , steam room , etc ) were cramped and average at best overall ( and notwithstanding several rainy days , which is a risk you take at this time of year ) , we had a wonderful vacation 
had a fantastic time i just got back from the excellence my hubby and were there from sept 29, 08 until oct we had a great time our room was beautiful very clean and spacious the staff was extremely friendly and catered to us luckily we had great weather the food is really good i am not a picky eater but my hubby is and he enjoyed the food as well the only negatives i have about this place are the flies at the toscana and the beach is too rough to swim in everything else was fine your greeted with champagne and a cool nice smelling towel during the day you hit the pools and the beach they have all sorts of activities going on at night they have shows and a club called alegria at night everyone gets dressed up and goes out to the restaurant of choice for dinner there are 7 restaurants and everynight it varies on which one will be closed its a great romantic atmosphere oh and something i have not seen mentioned , at night the maid comes to change the sheets and she leaves an itenarary for the following day we loved the itenarary it would state the weather the activities for the day and what was being cooked at 12:30pm by the beach , and what restaurants would be open i had a relaxing time there is that long bus ride but it did not bother me at all i think some people are just tooooooo picky and expect toooooo much i know you paid money for your trip but big deal you find a bug in your room or your towel is not white enough just go and have a good time and try not to focus on these little and i mean little minor set backs 
my wife and i visited the excellence punta cana 5/4/08 - 5/11/08 for our 6th year anniversary from the initial booking of the trip to the very end we were very impressed with the level of service and hospitality that all of the employees showed to us when we arrived at the punta cana airport we were greeted by our taxi driver our taxi was actually an upscale toyota hylander which was a great vehicle to travel in especially since the roads are so bumpy just like other reviews stated , you do go through some pretty poor areas but nothing like i have seen in the congo and rwanda in africa we felt that the food was great i have seen a lot of reviews that stated otherwise but after futher investigation of these reviews i realized that most of them were from people that lived in new york city granted , the food is not new york city grade but its amazing food our room was lovely they knew that it was our anniversary so one day when we got back to the room the bathtub was full of rose pettles and bubble bath our room was a swim up room which was really nice most days we just slept around the pool on the king size beds that were available or on the beach the beds by the pool we thought were best because you are protected from the wind that the beach exposes you to all in all , it was a great resort and we would go back again 
any thing but excellent my husband and i along with 2 other couples stayed at the excellence from september 13th -21st after a very long flight we were surprised to hear we still had a 1 1/2 hour bus ride to the resort the roads to te resort were bumpy and at times we only went 30 miles per hour and many of us were feeling sick by the time we got to the hotel the staff was very nice and we were greeted with champagne when we arrived when we got to our rooms we were surprised that they smelled very old and musty we tried to air them out but that did not help we called the front desk but nothing was done the smell stayed with us for our entire stay we had trouble with our safe staying locked and had to have it fixed our air conditioner was leaking and we had it fixed our power went out quite a few times and we had to keep setting the fuse box in the restaurants we had a hard time getting a table for 6 even though there were empty tables we were served dirty glasses and had bad service in one of the restaurants my husband was sick for 3 days and could not eat or drink any thing i also experienced stomach problems but not as bad as his three others in our party had stomach problems as well the bugs were so bad you could not sit out at night without your bug spray we did however enjoy the beach , pool , the entertainment and some very nice people we met the grounds were also kept very well this not a 4 1/2 star hotel it should be a 3 star at most the 6 of us will not be returning to the excellence 
excellence was excellent my husband and i visited the excellence punta cana in july 2008 for our first time away and alone from our 3 kids our expectations were exceeded and we had a fabulous time the price of the trip for what you get is great value - the resort itself is beautiful and the rooms excellent ( especially for the price ) food was very good to excellent at all restaurants we enjoyed the staff very much , they were friendly and approachable rolando the tennis pro went out of his way to be friendly and helpful berthold the exec chef was approachable and fun to talk to other great employees were : leomar , victor , alfredo , luis miguel and ricky we would definitely recommend the excellence punta cana to anyone wishing to visit the caribbean 
exceeded my expectations let me start by saying that i did not do my homework before going : i traveled alone and did not know that this is mostly a couple 's resort when i arrived , i thought the place looked amazing but braced myself for a rather dull experience since i was by myself and not many singles around i was kind of bored , that is , until i met the entertainment crew let me tell you : they were fantastic franklin was a great mc : energetic and fun juan carlos was full of life ines was funny and you would never know what she will do next : johanna is one of the best bachata and merengue dancers i have met altagracia was super friendly and mariel , well , she will charm you with her smile ( but watch out for her wicked volleyball serve between the games , the disco and other activities i had a great time nine days were not enough for me the food was very good : my favorites were the french and the mediterranean restaurants the drinks were great and the housekeeping crew and room service were fantastic overall , excellence exceeded my expectations and will definitely go back soon 
i expected more from excellence after much research , we booked a garden view at the excellence i have traveled the us and taken cruises to the western caribbean , so i feel like i know what a really great resort should be i will be objective room - please make sure the non - opening side of the patio door is shut or the ac wo not work we were not aware it would open by itself *important* - our safe would open automatically 30 seconds after we would lock it - if you left the room soon you would never know it had opened itself please wait after you think it 's locked for a minute to leave housekeeping - average at best we had to repeatedly ask for bathcloths and our mini bar was not stocked daily sometimes the room was not cleaned until late afternoon when we requested am food - really good except for chez , which was pretty bad beach - beautiful , but do not expect waiter service pools - very cleanbar - awesome drinks and bartendersentertainment - standard cruise shipcheck in/check out - very easyride to and from airport - awful , but then we knew that going in expedia has service for less than half of what you will pay if you wing it we had a good time , but will go to another country next time if i was going back to punta cana , i would try another resort 
a relaxing vacation we were at the excellence for our honeymoon from sept 16-23rd - we arrived here after staying for a week at the majestic colonial resort where we got married the good things about the excellence : - adults only - a quiet , relaxing atmosphere with a day time entertainment team that was friendly without being too loud or obnoxious - two pools - a long pool running parallel to the beach with lots of shady spots , and an infinity pool that was nestled among the hotel rooms and very quiet - lots of rafts to use in the pool - 8 restaurants with no - reservations required , room service included , no wrist bands - top shelf name - brand liquor and even a few brands of american beer to choose from - an ecological park with nice walking trails and two very friendly talking parrots that provided entertainment when we were missing our pets at home - the staff looked happy , they really tried to speak english , and it seemed like they enjoyed working there the okay things about the excellence : - the beach is very pretty , with sand that looks exactly like soft brown sugar the waves were too rough for swimming most days , and although there is a sign that tells you that you can walk 325 yards down the beach to better swimming and snorkling , we were reluctant to do this since it 's off resort property and we did not trust that it would be safe - the food was probably good for dominican standards , and average by canadian or american standards you have to give them credit though for the effort they put forward and for their ability to provide the caliber of food that they do in such a poor country very good selection things we were disappointed with : - it was our honeymoon , and although it said so on on our trip documents , they did not acknowlege this until we asked for a honeymoon banner to be put on our door , and we were never even offered the romantic dinner that is part of the free honeymoon package - on our last day there , it rained for the whole day and there was nothing to do - the animation team finally came into the main lobby and started interacting with the guests - we did not like the spa - of all of the resorts we have been to , it was probably the least appealing 
the excellence was excellente i just have to say that anything people say bad about punta cana , the dominican republic or excellence is pure nonsense to keep it as short as possible , everything about this property is a+++++ , everything the ride is an hour and 20 minutes , but who cares and it 's not bumpy like everyone says i was a trave agent up until about 2 weeks ago so i would not lie 
awful place we stayed august 25 - sep 5th 2008 we were upgraded to an excellence club room , which was very nice - - - - but we had mosquitos and other disgusting bugs and the air conditioner went out twice during the night - - - - - we had a staff member in our room @ 3am in the morning trying to fix it but was not even prepared with any tools finally we told him to come back the next day my husband was eaten alive by the mosquitos and sand flees our stay was so unpleasant because of this the staff is horrible they move so slowwwwwwwwww - ( except for dionel @ the pool bar - - he was very pleasant and fast ) i only say this because i am comparing them to the staff at excellence cancun we were expecting the same level of service , but was not even close the grounds are not being kept at all this hotel is a 3 star tops i was expecting the grounds to be as nice and well maintained as the exc cancun - - - - - - not the case - - this hotel is old and infested with bugs if you 've stayed at excellence cancun - - - - you will be so disappointed with exc punta cana 
disappointed i just returned from vacationing at epc from 9/13 to 9/19 after reading all the positive reviews i was sure that i would love this resort i also want to add that i am always skeptical of negative reviews and assume that these people must be too picky we have never had a problem with other resorts and are not generally picky by any means the ride to the hotel was not as bad as some make it out be it 's just a long ride after a long flight the welcome to the resort was very nice our room was not that great there were so many ants near the mini bar , walls and in the closet the jacuzzi had stains that resembled growth at the bottom it was essentially not able to be used without risking infection for some reason the room just did not seem clean the food , in my opinion was horrible breakfast was terrible much of the food was uncovered so flies took over the fruit did not appear fresh every time we got pancakes they were raw and oozing with batter in the center same with the omelette food seemed to be cooked with too much butter and salt lunch was a little better but it was by no means good food dinner was ok but it was very salty agave was good but it lacked atmosphere the beach was fantastic the red flag was up but we were still able to swim every day drink service was excellent as well the pool was ok but people would hoard 2 floats at once which was very annoying it 's not a very relaxing atmosphere either hence i 'd recommend the beach i do not think enough people emphasize the amount of mosquitoes at night i got about 60 bites i have pictures but will spare people pics of bug bites we used deet everynight but to no avail we went back to our room early one night because it got so bad nightly entertainment was fun but it would be nice to have the option to leave the resort we are used to vacationing in mexico where you can go down town and leave the resort it gets kind of old after the 3rd night the days get a bit redundant the gym was nice and the equipment was clean and new there are two parrots which made our trip do not get me wrong the service was excellent but this place was not for us i just wanted to give some people another point of view since vacation time is sacred we will stick with other carribean islands and mexico also , it is my opinion that this resort does not stand up to 4 5 stars as advertised it completely lacks the wow factor this is not a place for people that enjoy exploring outside a resort 
pleasant getaway our stay at excellence punta cana was from 02/12 ? transport to and from airport was a breeze prior to our arrival i e - mailed the resort about transfer options and was sent an e - mail with several options along with cost choices were helicopter us$398 00 each way (2 passengers with very limited luggage space ) , limousine us$175 00 each way (2 - 4 passengers )  taxi us$60 00 each way (2 - 4 passengers ) we opted for the taxi ride and upon exiting the airport our driver was there holding a sign with our names upon arriving at the resort he confirmed our return trip and on the day of departure he actually arrived a bit early this worked out perfectly note that the ride to the resort was about an hour?? very bumpy hour check - in at the resort was easy , we found our way to our room and we arrived the same time as the porter with our luggage our room was an ocean view room in building 11 the rooms were well appointed with fridge , tv , hairdryer , iron , and a coffee maker the room was about the size of an average hotel room the jacuzzi tub is in the room itself , the shower and toilet are in their own separate space the minibar/fridge included beer , water and soda which were replenished daily we found the beds to be extremely hard , but after a few nights we decided to put the very thick comforter under the bottom sheet to add a bit of padding and this was an improvement it wasn?? perfect but it helped a little and we weren?? quite as sore the next day the balconies are nice but a bit small the only issue of note was a power outage and loss of water on day 4 and 5 of our stay both unavailable for about 1 ? 2 hours on both days it was a bit inconvenient but survivable we did notice that the maps contained in the literature at the resort were a bit outdated as some of the restaurants were not located in the same places that they are on the maps but is was easy to figure out once we got the lay of the land there is a schedule of daily activities , so one shouldn?? want for things to occupy one?? time if you??e in search of more than just lounging on the beach or at the pool we were not impressed with the nightly entertainment with the exception of one evening that featured a small acrobatic troupe performing the remaining nights were filled with dance revue style entertainment with lots of lip syncing there are 7 restaurants at excellence , barcelona ( mediterranean ) , toscana ( italian ) , spice ( pan - asian ) , agave ( mexican ) , chez isabelle ( french ) , the lobster house , and the grill of the dining options we favored agave we felt the rest were mediocre breakfast and lunch were buffet style with your normal choices plus a few local dishes however if you choose to take lunch at the grill you have made to order menu options if you choose to dine at agave or chez isabelle make reservations early and be prepared to wait if you don?? the beach was nice there were numerous loungers and a few beach beds if you want a beach bed you need to snag one early before going down to breakfast we found ourselves having to get up as early as 7:45/8:00 to get a beach bed the same goes for the pool area , choice spots go early a couple of caveats for the beach is that the surf tends to be rough and most days were ??ed flag? days = no swimming and the beach also tended to be very windy at times the gorgeous swimming pool at excellence which winds beautifully through the property is a nice alternative to the rough surf for a refreshing dip overall our stay was pretty pleasant and we felt that we got our money?? worth and would not hesitate in recommending this resort to friends and family 
take mosquito spray my husband and i stayed at the excellence from 2-16 september and we had a fantastic time yes the road is bumpy but the drivers take great care so just sit back and enjoy the views hector on the front desk was a real star as when we arrived there was no record of our booking and thats not what you want to hear after a long 9hr flight he made several calls and then said the problem was at the dominican end but he could rectify it we had booked a junior swim - up room as it was our 30th wedding anniversary and hector upgraded us to a room in the excellence club area ( not the excellence club though ) it was a fabulous room and the cleaning staff kept it spotless throughout our stay the spice and chez isabella were our favourites but after being eaten alive ( through my clothes ) by mosquitos at the grill we decided to avoid all the outdoor eating places in the evenings but the grill does great food at lunchtime and you can watch the people floating in the pool whilst you eat , the beef palliard is fab around the pool the guy you need to know is juan , he is really friendly and keeps the drinks coming especially the ' dirty monkeys ' he works so hard but nothing is too much trouble for him also dorling on the beach is a star and very helpful now the downside mosquitos were really bad , we have been to the dom rep before but never had this much trouble but we were told that the heavy rains had made the problem much worse but we also had some sort of bug in our bed which bit us throughout the night giving us these very itchy small bites on the sides of our hands and feet the hotel were very swift though when we complained and the room was fumigated and the whole bed changed we are hoping that it was a one - off but would like to know if any others were affected we did love the hotel and would recommend it for couples just take loads of spray 
dangerous beach extremely dangerous beach there were multiple drownings while we were there there were no rescue efforts , only recovery of the bodies , which the families had to pay the locals to do those poor families there were no lifeguards and the resort does not care , nor do any local or national authorities there were no lifeguards the water was extremely rough with severe rip currents and undertow do not go in past your knees/waist i am an expert swimmer/diver and have been swimming in the ocean my entire life the deaths of course put a black cloud on the whole experience the resort is beautiful and the restaurants were awesome the swimming pools and spa were excellent the quality and variety of the food is top - notch the management was very responsive to our flooding in our room and ac concerns ( we stayed in a bldg that was still being renovated trip from the airport to the resort was abominable the roads are third world and seem as if they were bombed the drivers drive insane those who suffer car sickness must take meds for the hour or so trip bottom line : the resort with all its restaurants , pools , gardens , etc truly amazing and worth it , but please do all of your swimming in the abundant and beautiful swimming pools , and leave the ocean for wading and going on walks 
great place with a few major/minor setback my wife and i were extremely excited after reading all of the great reviews from this site the resort was beautiful ( take lots of bug spray ) the beach itself was soft and the accomodations were fantastic there were plenty of tikki huts , beach chairs , beach beds , towels and you did not have to wake at the crack of dawn to reserve one we too were there during the end of hurricane gustav , during hannah and the begining of ike the people were nice and very accomodating and it does help if you speak the native language the shows during the evening are a nice touch and give you an alternative on site for evening entertainment now the downside the first night my shorts were stolen ( do not leave anything on the patio to dry ) we constantly had to spray off around our room to set up a perimeter to keep the bugs out there were a lot of them hidding in the furniture but none too close to our bed thank god the biggest issue we had was the cleanliness of our drinking glasses 6 of every 10 glasses that we were served a drink in were noticeably dirty ( we noticed because we started counting after my wife and i both experienced stomache issues ) some even had remenants of old drinks ( such as mint ) in the glass the restaurants while plentiful are average at best overall our experience was good because we were together at a beautiful resort with good people bugs and cleanliness were our biggest issues s we have spent alot time in the carribean and are not being snobs i simply put in here what i think others would want to know when traveling here 
but not 'excellente ' my boyfriend and i just got back from spending a week at the excellence we booked through thomas cook as you have probably read from the other reviews , the road to the hotel is bad it 's quite bumpy and the driving skills over there are appalling , but because we were in an air conditioned coach , it did not really bother me that much the arrival at the hotel was ok - i was expecting a bit more after the reviews some people had written on here - my boyfriend had a cold class of sparkling wine , but when i asked for a non - alcoholic drink because i 'm 8 weeks pregnant i got the dirtiest look ever and did not receive a drink the first room they put us in was very nice , but there was no handle on the toilet and literally no water in the cistern - this i did not expect from the resort there was also extreme condensation on the windows and the room smelt of mould we rang hector on the front desk and he assured us that we would be moved to a different room within half an hour we waited for about an hour beofre ringing again and finally got moved to another room in the same building even then , we had to call out the maintenance guy to fix our bath and tv we had room service for our first dinner and i hardly even touched it - the burger was almost raw over the next few days the service we received from the hotel definitely improved although we encountered more problems because of thomas cook the emergency number they had given to the hotel was incorrect and so we left a voicemail on a random number expecting them to get back to us within the hour as they had promised , ofcourse they never did if you book through thomas cook or any other uk travel agent , i would not recommend going on any of the excursions they offer - we went on three and thought they were all over - priced and not worth spending a day out of the well kept beach and resort we went on the reef explorer which was the best , isla catalina which was a complete waste of our time and the bavaro splash which we 're waiting for a refund on from thomas cook unless you are a james bond wannabe , i do not recommend this trip at all the food : i expected better from the restaurants if i 'm honest i did not think the food was up to the standard of the hotel , but everyone is different i probably wo not be recommending this resort or be returning to the dominican republic 
ca not wait to go back even though we were shortsigted enough to book our trip during hurricaine season , excellence punta cana was everything it advertises we had our wedding there and the staff and wedding coordinators could not have been more wonderful because it rained on our wedding day , they smoothly moved the ceremony indoors and their calm attitude and cheerfulness really contributed to the overall success of our day the resort is beautiful , easy to navigate after the first day and staffed by the most friendly people ever as little problems arose ( our key did not work once and we did not have washclothes ) they were resolved immediately and without hassel the food is good for the larges masses it is made for and the drinks at the bars were great we are anxiously awaiting our next trip to excellence 
another lovely vacation we just returned from celebrating our six year anniversary our vacation was very relaxing this was our 4th luxury all inclusive , and although this has not been our favorite , we can honestly say that we were satisfied with our stay as previously discussed in prior reviews , the trip to the the resort is a bumpy one it was actually more bumpy than i could ever prepare for , but not so bad considering you sort of know what to expect and you get a tour of the area this was great considering we did not leave the resort once we got there we ate at all of the restaurants for dinner with the exception of toscana ( which of course we ate at for breakfast ) there was always a great variety of options to choose from at each restaurant and even on the room service menu our favorites were as follows : the steak house ( best t - bone we have had in awhile ) , spice , and barcelona we didnt really care for chez isabelle suprisingly maybe it was what we ordered we found that the food overall was a hit or miss still there were so many options to choose from , so no reason to complain please be prepared to eat at the outdoor restaurants i hate to admit , but the mosquitos are probably the only thing that caused us to be distracted during this vacation even though we thought we were well prepared by bring 90% deep woods sports off , this did not matter i can honestly say that the resort makes an effort , however there is only so much they can do you can expect to get bit the rooms were average compared to other resorts we have stayed at , however they were always clean we had a pillow top added to the mattress prior to arriving so we were ok our maid came twice a day and our refrigerator was well stocked twice a day it seemed the beach and pool were both great we expecially like the service we received at the pool bar and on the beach it was great that they offered pizzas during lunchtime the ocean is a bit rough , but this did not bother us the only thing that we were a bit surprised about was the clarity of the water i guess we were expecting more of a clear tourquoise color , but i understand that the resort is on the atlantic side we did not go on any outside excursions , however did take advantage of the horseback tour which was complimentary do not forget to take part in this if you go it was a nice experience we also took full advantage of the spa services while there they offer spa specials during the week so i went twice the entertainment was actually pretty good the sax player domingo is not to be missed ( ask him about his cd ) he plays almost everynight before and after the main show do not miss the michael jackson show , the dominican show and the circus show overall , this was a good vacation my only disappointment was the severity of the mosquito bites that me and my husband experienced despite many efforts to avoid again , this is no fault of the resort i think most couples had the same experience but still attempted to have an open mind 
excellence is just ok my boyfriend and i stayed at this hotel 8/11 -815 it was my first time staying an all inclusive , adults only resort it was a peaceful relaxing vacation the property was clean and the staff was friendly you should brush up on your spanish , otherwise you will have a problem communicating with the staff the beach was absolutely beautiful we highly recommend taking a helicoptor to and from the airport it took us an hour and a half to get to the hotel and 2 hours to get back to airport on the bus , because of the tropical storm that came in the last day , and there were a lot of pot holes on most of the roads to the hotel the food was just ok , you have to ask for premium alcohol or you will get the cheap stuff in all of your drinks bring or buy bug spray we both got eaten alive we loved the saxaphone player , that played in the lobby in the evening he played jazz music that was so romantic we liked his music so much , that we bought 2 cd 's from him for $20 we got them home and tried to play them in both of cd players and they would not work i have sent emails to domingo and the hotel concierge our travel agent also called the hotel we were told that he would mail us a new cd that was weeks ago all in all it was a nice vacation 
'excellente ' and so much more my husband and i just returned from our honeymoon at the excellence it rained the first 2 days while we were there due to the hurricanes , but rain included , we still had an incredible time the staff tries their hardest to keep everyone entertained and happy , whether it be through games , entertainment , etc there were many things to get involved with throughout the day if you wanted to or you were able to just relax and sit on the beautiful beach we opted for a little bit of both joel and ines were always looking to get the guests involved with activities and have a good time , great job the servers on the beach were very pleasant and came around to take drink orders frequently the staff at the excellence spoke english very well and were even eager to learn some new words they may have not been familiar with before the food at the resort was wonderful breakfast at toscana in the mornings was always very good , we especially loved the potatoes our favorite restaurant was spice , which we ate at twice , but they were all very good and we enjoyed having a vast array of options to choose from at each restaurant , there were many choices to choose from to accomodate each persons tastebuds even the housekeeping at the resort took special care of their guests we received flowers in our room in the mornings and extra chocolates in our room at night the beds were more firm then usual , but we still slept fine yes , the hotel is roughly 50-60minutes from the airport , but definitely worth the ride we loved this place and would recommend it 
beautiful resort - but too buggy and humid perhaps it was the time of year that by boyfriend and i decided to go (8/26-9/1) but we were very uncomfortable in the evenings due to the lack of air conditioning throughout the hotel out of seven restaurants there were only (3) that were enclosed ( toscana , spice  agave ) the grill which is a steak house is over the pool how can anyone be expected to eat steak in such hot and humid conditions i had heard about the mosquito 's and came prepared i had can 's of off , suntan lotion with bug repellent for an army i was diligent each and every day wore no perfum , but still received about 100 bites nothing seemed to work even the hotels admirable efforts failed the sand flies by the beach are evil entertainment each night is held in the luxurious lobby - but it 's all open , no a/c there is a fantastic sax player each evening , but you could not enjoy him because your sweating and scratching non - stop overall , the hotel is beautiful and the staff were very accomodating the rest of the island is very , very poor although , we had a good time - we will not go back 
great time at excellence we stayed at the excellence for 11 nights on our honeymoon it has taken me awhile to write this review because i was so upset leaving , we had a wonderful honeymoon here when we landed at pc airport we got on our shuttle bus with 2 other couples we were on our way to the resort when the driver pulled in so we had to get off the bus and stand at the side of the road it was dark at this stage and i have to admit i was a little scared but a bodyguard arrived within a few minutes he had a gun then i was thinking i want to go home it took about 40 minutes to get us up and running again , and it was a nervous ride to the hotel but once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted so warmly we forgot about our bus ride rooms : i was really impressed with our room , very clean , lovely bed , nice bathroom and jacuzzi , minibar ( stocked daily ) they sent up a bottle of champagne and basket of fruit because we were honeymooners - nice touch food : i was also impressed with the food so much variety and the quality was so good the buffets for breakfast and lunch were my favourite they had everything - cereals , fruit , meat , pastas , desserts and if you do not feel like going to the restaurants for lunch they come around to the pools with pizza beach  pool : the beach is amazing we had so much fun at the beach riding the waves the pools are wonderful and clean it 's great just to lounge around in the pool on one of the floats we never had a problem getting a lounger or float entertainment/activities : the entertainment crew are great , they work so hard they try and get everyone to participate but they do not overdo it and annoy you we only did one tour - saona island and i would definitely recommend it - paradise service : i ca not emphasise enough how great all the staff were from bar staff and to cleaning staff they always had a friendly smile for you we did not always tip as it was included in our price but the staff were always so helpful we really did not mind giving a few extra dollars here and there would definitely recommend the excellence resort , ca not wait to return 
my boyfriend and i just returned from a 7 night stay at the excellence resort let me start by saying wow the trip from start to finish was absolutely amazing we booked our trip through allinclusiveoutlet they made the process seamless every necessary arrangement was taken care of and you were assinged a travel agent that you could speak with directly in the event you had any questions the ride from the airport is about an hour long the ride is kind of rough and bumpy but i never felt as if i was in danger ( if you are prone to motion sickness i would recommend taking something ) vip was the travel service that took us to and from the hotel , they were professional and very helpful upon arrival we were greeted with a towel and glass of champagne check in was simple and quick and we were in our room with our luggage in about 15 minutes the resort is absolutely stunning and the staff goes to great lenghts to keep it this way we had a garden view junior suite in building 6 ( great location ) the room was big , clean and never musty as i have read in other reviews housekeeping came to the room twice a day always did a great job and replenshed the towels every time we even had the room beautifully decorated with flowers and petals on a few occasions we made sure to tip the housekeeper each day the food was very good there is a wide variety to choose from for breakfast , lunch and dinner each day our favorite restaurant by far was chez isabel with spice , agave and toscano close behind the service was top notch and our glasses were always filled the restaurant manager and executive chef often came around to check on the service and food i have to give a shout out to ramon who was the best waitor at chez isabel the pools are gorgeous and very clean towels for the beach and pool are very easy to find all you have to do is ask the beach is beautiful , the water is crystal clear and tame compared to the national seashore in cape cod in addition to the beauty of the resort the second best part of the trip was the amazing staff i cannot express enough how they all made the trip perfect the swim up bar was always a good time bartenders dionel , rafelina and hector luis were friendly and fun to hang out with and they always kept the drinks coming no matter how busy it got julio from the entertainment staff remembered our names and always stopped to chat and see how we were doing each time he saw us throughout the week by night our favorite bar was martini and the single reason for this was bartender amado ( yeah baby ) his humor , professionalism , personality and great attitude should be comended we made a trip to the bar during his hours each day just to check in and each time it put a smile on our face we tipped our bartenders and watiress/waitor each day as well whether or not you tip the service you receive will be the same but we found they all deserved it as you can tell we found the trip to be super excellente and plan on returning in the near future 
great trip to excellence resort we just spent a week in punta cana , dr excellence resort i read a ton of reviews on this site to help us plan our trip for the ride in , we had private transportation it was a 1 hour ride it was worth getting private transportation as there are no stops no waiting for our room because we booked a club level room this was an anniversary trip for myself and my husband we were looking for specific things - - - no children , nice pool and beach , variety of restaurants , and a clean well maintained resort i feel we definately got that at this resort i have looked at other reviews where people complained about the food we had no problems food was great if you go to a 3rd world country looking for a 5 star meal for the price you pay to go to these resorts , well then you are just plain unrealistic our room was clean and well maintained we got a oceanview room , but it really was not oceanview that piece was not worth getting that level room , because we thought we would have the beach right in front of us , and we did not the service at the resort was great we were waited on , but not excessively to the point where it is annoying the shows also were not broadway , but we were not going there for a broadway show my husband and i are new yorkers and we loved the entertainment and it kept us happy as for the club level , it appears we did get some things that were worth it , such as movies to rent ( no fee ) , internet access , and the seperate concierge desk from the other people on the resort we also had towels for the pool always available to us while on the resort we found out towels were hard to get a hold of we were able to get them from the concierge our cleaning lady also made sure she left beach towels in the room ( this also could have to do with us leaving her a tip daily ) we tipped all the staff even though it was not expected after the ride in , we realized how terrible the poverty was there we gave tips to the cleaning lady , bar service , restaurant staff , and bellman last year we stayed at dreams cancun this resort was comparible each have their own positives and negatives bring bug spray ( the mosquitos are terrible ) and sunscreen the shops are so expensive 
excellence was excellente we just returned from a week in punta cana and i?? ready to book my next vacation the excellence resort was better than anything i could have imagined the staff was nice and friendly ? every resort employee would ask ???mo est?s? and they seemed offended if i didn?? answer ??xcellente here?? a breakdown : resort property : the resort is huge - everything was spread out so that it never seemed crowded and it is clean and constantly maintained we enjoyed walking through the botanical gardens and seeing all of the resort ??ets? the large , open air lobby is beautiful and you immediately feel like you??e in paradise rooms : our junior ocean front suite had a beautiful canopied four poster bed and a large jacuzzi tub and the view was amazing it was cleaned daily and bed was turned down each evening mini - bar was stocked daily , however it didn?? stay very cold we were in building 11, which we liked because it was farther away from the activities and very quiet , although it was quite a walk to the restaurants beach/pool : the main pool was very large and nice because you could also see and hear the ocean we spent most days on one of the cushioned beds poolside ( you had to get up early to get one ) the beach was beautiful - crystal clear , blue water , but a little rough ( could have been the lingering hurricane gustav ) we never had a problem finding a chair or towel at the beach or pool food : i read several reviewers complain about the food and i honestly don?? get it all of the 5 restaurants we went to for dinner were wonderful agave ( franco was the best ) and spice probably our favorites we skipped lobster house and the grill because we heard they weren?? very good we rarely had to wait more than a few minutes , except for the french restaurant , where the service also wasn?? spectacular ( maybe part of the french experience the breakfast and lunch buffets were very good and they changed things up almost daily they had a grill station where some items were made to order you have to remember that this is a foreign country , so it isn?? going to be exactly like home and if you don?? speak spanish , there is a communication gap - if you are picky and special order something , good luck? beverages : they were plentiful it started every morning with the mimosa/bloody mary bar at breakfast the fruity drinks were very good and they had a good selection of liquors - not top shelf , but well brands and several to choose from there were plenty of bars and the service was fairly quick ( remember you are on island time ) activities/entertainment : we didn?? do much at all , but it looked like there was plenty to do if you wanted to the track in the botanical gardens was nice if you can run in the heat the gym was well equipped we really enjoyed the ??ree? if you know how to ride , they will even let you run down the beach ( if you??e lucky enough to get a horse that will run ) i saw some reviews that the horses were not well taken care of as a horse owner , i can say most of them looked very well fed it seemed the skinny ones ( including the one i rode ) were just old the evening shows were very entertaining don?? miss the circus , 70??/80?? night and the michael jackson show get there early for mj to get a good seat other tips : yes , the bugs are bad at night , but i never had a problem if i wore bug spray one night i forgot and i was eaten up the ride from the airport is long and bumpy , but really not that bad ( no worse than a typical nyc cab driver ) if you can?? handle it , trust me , don?? ever go to st we didn?? do the excellence club , but i would agree with other reviewers that it doesn?? seem worth the extra money 
lives up to the name we stayed at excellence punta cana august 23-27, 2008 this was my first visit to the dominican republic i have stayed at several all - inclusive resorts in mexico , and excellence punta cana beat them all hands - down the food , staff and facilities were all top - notch this resort deserves 10 stars we had no problems with our standard garden - view room the room always stayed cool , and it was very spacious we decided on saving money by booking the least expensive room because we planned on spending the majority of our vacation on the beach and in the pool - not in the room food was great we ate all of our breakfasts at toscana ( buffet style ) some days we had lunch at toscana and others at the grill both restaurants were great for lunch we had dinner at chez isabelle ( great food ) , spice ( small portions but good ) , the grill ( fantastic ) , and the lobster house ( okay ) our least favorite was the lobster house the grill was our favorite the beach was pretty rough tropical storm fay had recently passed through , so 5-6' waves were commonplace on the beach i found it almost impossible to snorkel on excellence 's beach and i am a very experienced swimmer the pool at the resort is fantastic best drinks in the entire resort are at the swim - up pool bar ( blue ) dionel , rafaelina and hector all were fantastic the staff at the resort really works hard at making every aspect excellent we will definitely return to excellence punta cana and highly recommend it to others 
good trip first i would like to say there were definitely bugs by bugs i mean mosquitoes and there were ants in the sand the mosquitoes were only horrible walking through the hallways to get to your room , and eating at the outside restaurants my boyfriend only got bit once but they really took a liking to me now , the bites did not ruin the trip for me and i still had a good time my advice is to spray yourself with off before you walk out of your room and you should be fine the off at the pharmacy is 13 dollars so it 's pricey but i would have paid 30 for it ride to resort we booked a private limo through the resort which ended up being nice they have beer and cokes stocked in the limo for you i do get very car sick but the ride is not that bad there are pot holes but if you just enjoy watching the scenery as you drive by , you should be fine if you book a limo be prepared to pay in cash as soon as they drop you off resort told us we could pay at checkout time but that was not accurate the resort saw us counting our money out to pay the limo , and asked if we needed more since they had made a mistake , which we thought was very nice arrival to resort , greeted with glass of champaign and check in was very easy we had the excellence club so we checked in over there i think it is worth getting the excellence club because we enjoyed being able to have free internet and having some drinks before dinner resort groundsmy boyfriend loved the grounds but i was a bit disappointed none of the pools have ocean views so that was disappointing if you want to see the ocean you have to walk to the ocean roomswe had an excellence swim up ocean view room room was nice and the air conditioner worked the whole time there was no ocean view though we did not call to complain because we were happy with our room i def would have rather gotten just an ocean view room instead of ocean view swim up we always just ended up walking to the pool instead of walking outside our balcony beds were hard but we slept well we did call and ask for the bed top and goose pillows which we received the second day we left the maid a tip every day and we received what we asked for foodfood was average but we ate with no complaints our favorite was the italian and mexican breakfast at tuscany was very good staffstaff was nice and they were accommodating some were a little rude but who cares , we were not spending our vacation with them beachbest beach i have been to yet sand is super soft and the water was beautiful just be careful when you walk up to the stores on the beach because that is where the ants are in the sand overall we had a great time but i would not return due to mosquitoes and no ocean view when you??e in the pools 
loved the excellence punta cana the excellence in punta cana , dominican republic is one of the most beautiful resorts i 've ever stayed at we had a swim up room which has a patio that opens up on the pool the pools , 2 of them , are huge they go from one end of the resort to the other we stayed at the far end of the resort , and could literally swim from the room all the way to the other end of the resort , and only get out of the water for 5 seconds to get into the second pool the room was wonderful , had a full minibar with everything we needed , and we never ran out the sand on the beach was sooo clean , it was like playground sand , and went for as far as our eyes could see the staff treated us like royaly , getting us anything we wanted the restaurants had good food , and were always available the lobster house was good , but it 's not the same flavor of lobster as we are used to some of the vendors that showed up were a little annoying , but that 's expected , they need to sell to make a living , and we only saw them on the resort one evening the only problem we experienced was the mesquitos the first night there they were attacking like it was full out war , and my legs got chewed up after that , we used bug spray and it was not a problem , so make sure you take some the trip from the airport to the resort goes through some very poor towns , and was an eye - opener for anyone who 's never travelled to another country i highly recommend the horse rides , they travel through the jungle , stop on the beach to take pictures , then back to the hotel along the beach , it was beautiful the water was warm ( pool and ocean ) and had some fairly big waves that were fun to swim in the resort is a long way from any shopping centers , so if it 's shopping you 're interested in , you 'll have to take an excursion to get there overall i would highly recommend excellence punta cana to anyone 
interesting culture and fabulous for rest and relaxation my husband , sister , brother in law , and i who are between 25-45 years old returned from punta cana on august 31st we booked our all inclusive package in october 2007 our room 11201 was ocean view , but we were only able to see palm trees and the pool having stayed on this end of the resort i would have preferred a room on the bottom floor where you could walk directly into the pool my sister stayed in room 1206 which is at the opposite end of the resort and her ocean view room was amazing the resort is primarily for those who want to read a book by the beach or pool or take naps many of the people who stayed at the resort either woke up really early or early afternoon they are right about the towels and mats by the time we ate breakfast we seldom were able to locate either my husband and i love to travel and we enjoy taking in all of the sites and culture we booked the party boat which involved snorkeling , swimming with the sharks , and stingrays , entertainment , and drinking i am glad we purchased the excursion because the pool hey have built for the sharks and stingrays in the middle of the ocean is very impressive the drive to the party boat is approximately 45 minutes you can purchase a dvd of the excursion but it is overpriced at $35 and does not show the cruise in its entirety we also booked the santo domingo ( capital ) excursion , which included a trip to the hard rock cafe or tgi fridays and christopher columbus 's memorial it is an all day excursion from 7:20 a the day before the excursion we ran into the vip tour representative and he told us that he would notify us if the excursion was cancelled due to not having enough people assuming everything was as planned we woke up at 5:30 a and waited in the lobby for our tour bus that was to arrive at 7:20 a after 1 hour of waiting we came to the sad conclusion that our excursion was cancelled without notification we did get a full refund and did not let it effect the remainder of our trip the drinks at the resort are wonderful the bartenders are exceptional and good at remembering your face and drink if i remember correctly our vip tour rep told us that they work 12 days straight the work hard and long hours and deserve tips the food is different i enjoy experiencing different foods and i am happy for the experience on our second to last day we found out that the lobster house had nachos we were in the pool bar and the nice bartender ( ca not remember her name ) brought all four of us nachos i though this was very kind of her oregano also has very good pizza if we did not get full after our meal we would visit orgeno most of the restaurants are open every night so there are a lot of options the rooms are great i could not have asked for anything better the 70's/80's rewind show was wonderful also , we enjoyed the piano bar when the man from jamaica entertained my husband and i were married in jamaica in 2007 and we enjoy their music the vip tour bus was scheduled to pick us up to go to the airport on august 31st at 7:20 a once again they did not show and were unable to reach them by telephone we called a cab which cost $80 if you decide to purchase mamajuana do not take it home dry it must be in alcohol we purchased 4 bottles and they were disposed of in the st louis missouri airport they do not tell you this at the resort or the dr airport where it is sold you can bring back alcohol (2 bottles per person ) and cigars as long as they are not cuban my husband and i also took professional pictures which look great they are very inexpensive and worth the money my advice to all of you who are considering visiting excellence dr is to do it the experience is wonderful you will find many people who love it and many people who find it average have an openmind for those of you planning to book this trip enjoy yourself it is a great experience 
2nd time just as great we just returned from our second time at excellence and everything was great , just as it was the first time everyone actually remebered us and it was fantastic we do have to mention everyone , hopefully i do not forget anyone first of all there was altagracia , shorty , who took care of our every need on the beach or pool she is a sweetheart then we have the bartenders , rafalena , dionel , kenny , juan , domingo , reyna and julio - caesar , they are all great benjamin keeps the bars in tow the entertainment committee which was julio , altagracia , johanna and alexandra , they kept you on your toes and were just great the place itself is wonderful we went last year at the same time and went back again , and everyhting was just as good if not better than last year victor keeps everyone in food services on thier toes we went for 16 days this year and every day was wonderful (7/31-8/15) the beach is great , rough in one part and a little way down it is as calm as anything the best of both worlds our favorite restaurant was the fench , chez isabelle we tried them all , probably our least favorite was agave , the mexican , it just was too bland for us the folklore , on the beach , was great all of the dominican food was fantastic the weather that night was good so it made the night just perfect the vacation was absolutley perfect , except for the ride home we got stuck in tropical storm fay and the airport experience was a nightmare hopefully we will forget that experience and return again next year wonderful poeple at the resort , they would do anything for you 
true excellent at excellence resort my husband and i recently returned from an eight night stay at excellence punta cana this was our second time at the resort , having honeymooned there four years ago when it was called secrets excellence our stay this time was beyond our highest expectations our room was beautiful and meticulously clean the choice of restaurants has increased and we ate at all of them many times believe it or not , many nights we ate two dinners at two different restaurants ( yes , we put on a little weight , but it was well worth it the food was incredibly fresh , creative and delicious at all of the restaurants our absolute favorite were the french and mediterranean restaurants i remember having the grilled portobello mushroom - perfectly cooked and finished off with the house wine we also participated in a lot of activities and went to the shows every night they were a lot of fun and you can tell that the staff puts their hearts and souls into every performance speaking of the staff , we found them all to be friendly , courteous and very helpful i ca not name them all , but i do want to single out roberto puello , manager of club excellence roberto was the best , making our stay a truly memorable one i would also like to thank a particular member of the entertainment crew , named alexandra she taught our beach yoga , aqua gym and step aerobics classes with so much energy and enthusiasm that it was contagious , and she helped me to burn off some of the many delicious calories this was our best vacation yet wishing we could return every year , pascalia papadopoulos mattioli 
excellence was a nice vacation excellence punta cana gave my boyfriend and i a nice vaction here is some info on each aspect : arrival : yes , the ride from the airport to the hotel is bumpy and there is not much to see but what can you really do about that once we got to the hotel we were impressed with how beautiful everything was check in was easy - our room was not quite ready when we got there so they told us to go eat right next door and it would be ready when we were done and it was rooms : i was impressed with the rooms i thought they were beautifully decorated and very clean we had a junior suite garden view on the first level so we had a private hammock next to the pond and a patio the bath was amazing - it is big enough for two and the jets were wonderful the only thing that was bad was the water pressure in the tub was very low so it took a while to fill the bed was a little hard but not really a big deal the minibar was nice too - it kept us hydrated with water , beer , and a small selection of sodas food : i thought the food was pretty good there was always a nice selection toscana was our favorite you could also get room service 24/7 and that food was pretty good as well i thought the desserts were fabulous great selection and great tasting drinks were pretty good as well there are bars everywhere beach : beautiful it is huge and there was never many people there the water is the atlantic ocean so it is a little rough but fun pool : again , beautiful it is huge so there is always somewhere to go if you wanna relax on a float , get a drink , or play volleyball also , very well maintained service : i would say the service was just ok i 've been to other countries in the carribean and was more impressed with the service there the employees here did not seem quite as happy or pleasant it was never to the point where we were annoyed , just not impressed also , language barrier is not a problem english is spoken everywhere and even those who you do not typically talk to like the maids speak a few words of english activities/entertainment : always something to do the nighttime entertainment was the best , but for the big shows make sure you get there early or you will have to sit in the back with your view obstructed by a pole the casino is very small , a few blackjack tables and some slots we did not really spend much time in there you get a sheet everynight with a list of all the things to do the next day which was nice to have the horseback riding was okay too - you get a free 30 minutes with your stay and it 's nice but the horses are pretty sad looking last tip : do not shop in the gift shops on site - the prices are very high and they will only come down a few dollars when pushed there are shops down the beach that are nice the people are pushy and will give you a ridiculous first offer but you can talk them down pretty much to whatever price you want never pay more than 50 percent of their first offer 
our honeymoon it 's taken us a while to write the review to family problems upon our return to the uk but here it is at last this was our second holiday at excellence punta cana and we chose to come again as we knew we would have a superb honeymoon after our first trip which was amazing firstly , anyone from the uk who comes here will want to upgrade to premium on the plane we flew economy the first time and premium this time and it makes the world of difference on leg room , recline on seats and service which is all important on such a long flight get a taxi from the airport , the journey takes an hour and would take longer on the tour operator coach people complain about the roads but in the 12 months between our stay they have improved dramatically , we have been told that the problem is the rain which is so heavey it takes the tarmac out of the pot holes within days of them being filled in the new motorway is also being built which will make the world of difference once completed the resort has a range of restaurants which i am sure you will have read about our comment is based solely upon our experience on several occasions we tried to eat at the pizzaria and waited upto 20 minutes without seeing a member of staff so never did try it the food is more than good and varied , i think my husbands favourite was probably the langostines in chez isabelle rooms - clean , tidy , maid service varied in timing so was awkward to avoid when taking a trip back to the room they kindly upgraded us to an excellence room but this was not really different to the standard room except for the additional mini bar facilities we did have a few problems whilst there and were disappointed , not because they happened but purely because there was no explanation from staff or apology , it was simply ignored in short , the resort was undergoing some minor construction work ( we werent advised of this when booking ) and there were several power cuts in the second week of our stay these were generally over half an hour in length and on more than one occasion lasted several hours this would not have been a problem except the toilets and running water rely on the electricty to function and even staff were flumoxed as they were washing the floors with pond water we would strongly recommend taking a day trip to the animal adventure park and upgrading your package to trainer for a day this is still under ?100 00 per person and you get to swim with sea lions , sharks and rays you also get to train the sea lions , parrots , hold a monkey , snakes and sit with a full sized tiger in her enclosure this day trip was probably the highlight of our stay ( please ask for photos if you want an idea of how close you can get ) the service there was superb they spoke multiple languages very well and were extremely friendly and knowledgeable overall i would recommend this resort , the staff are friendly and helpful and we will probably go back again but will be trying the playa riviera resort next year for our anniversary as we have already been here twice s spannish lessons are best when franklin is about and the kafe cafe bar was great in the evenings with jose 
outstanding 08/28/08 i just returned from a 5 day stay at the excellence i would greatly recommend this resort the beach is well kept and clean the water is spectacular the food is outstanding the staff is very helpful i would recommend doing the excellence club many of the resturants do not like you to go in for lunch with a bathing suit /cover - up on the men must wear a t - shirt , not tank top the excellence club is a private club that only members have access to you can go in as you please , wear what you want and the service is excellent i would also recommend taking bug spray and use it at night the ride from the airport took about an hour and is kinda bumpy we had a private car , so we did not have to stop anywhere else i would recommend getting one if you can if you go , stop at nancy 's just next to the resort on the beach you can get any type of gift for half the price you would pay at the gift shop and she will bargain with you the casino is not very large , maybe 15 slot machines and three tables we had a blast i would not recommend this resort for singles this resort is mainly for couples 
excellent vacation we stayed at the resort for our 20th avnniversary the bus ride was about an hour ride a little bumpy but not that bad the resort was beautiful and always clean its plenty of resturants , lots of beach activities and nighthly entertainment we had a wonderful time at excellence you will enjoy listening to damingo the saxaphone player i want to thank franklinjuan carlosjoeljoannejuliothey will keep you busy with a lot of fun stuff to do 
the excellence is pretty excellent hotel room - - very very nice with balcony and jacuzzi well stocked refridgerator - - beer soda and water daily room service - - almost around the clock - - no charge several restaurants - - the grill and pasta places were the best - - stay away from the french and mexican restaurants i heard the lobster place was not that great and i tolerated the barcelona the bars - - the bars are everywhere and service is on the beach and by the pool side and in the lobby if your drink is not strong enough - - not to worry just let your server know you would like a double there is also a swim up bar water volley ball - - great fun - - there is always a game in progress you can joinstaff - - very cordial and accommodatingbeach - - wonderfulpools - - there are two one for those who want to play and drink at the swim up bar and another for quiet relaxation it even has a water fall fitness center - - brand new facility with treadmills , stationary bikes , free weights etc very well air conditioned too casino - - very small 3 black jack tables , 1 roulette table and two caribbean poker tables and about 15 slot machines other - - internet cafe ( not really a cafe in fact its called internet coffee ) its pretty pricey , spa treatments ( additional cost ) and small shops which are extremely over priced as are vendors who set up shop there there are excursions and other activities you can pay for 
excellence - best there is ok , first to dispell all the rumors the busride is not that bad those who complain about the busride will complain about anything we stopped along the way to get an el presidente , go to the bathroom , take some pics and really kind of enjoyed the ride was it bumpy was it the worst ride ever on the ride to the hotel you will see some countryside is it as nice and clean as the u but remember you are not in the us anymore and you will be staying at a nice clean resort so who cares what the rest of the country looks like alright , onto the specifics the resort is huge i ca not think of another resort that i have been to that is bigger it is beautiful well taken care of , clean , and the welcoming was very nice the pools are very nice , lots of chairs , could use a few more rafts , pool bar is great , lots of pool activities in the afternoons v - ball , water polo , water aerobics , etc ) food - great i love the food at this place lots of restaurants to chose from , great variety of food , and all restaurants were very nice the only meal i did not enjoy was breakfast and that was only until i found the pancake and omelet station beach - beautiful the beach was amazing people - other than the slight language barrier everyone was great always willing to say hola , como estas in short this resort was true to it 's name 
when you get there you do not want to leave new jersey , the excellence resort punta cana , dominican republicfantastic is the best way to describe our stay at the excellence edwin at the front desk was very accommodating when we checked in loved the 4 poster k ing size bed the room was spotless , and so was the grounds and resturants we thought the shows were great did not expect it loved the michael jackson show the best there were plenty of activities if you wanted to take advantage or you could just chill by the pool or beach on a lounge chair under a hut the beach was beautiful waves if you want or you could walk down to the right a little and the water will be calm i took lovely pictures the pool was fun and clean everyday when i met for the aqua arobics our husbands went to the swim up bar for a drink juan carlos was amazing we enjoyed talking with the crew , joel , franklin and the many girls the workers were so friendly and the drinks were great we thought the breakfast were out of this world the barbaques the beach and at thr plaza were wonderful the food and service at the resturants awesome you will truly enjoy listening to the saxaphone player called domingo at the plaza at night the only thing that was annoying at night was the moquitos just bring spray 
domingo , rafael to whom it may concern , my wife and i just spent a great week at the excellence punta cana our days were spent relaxing and enjoying the great weather and all activities they had to offer now our evenings were spent sitting in front of domingo , enjoying his wonderful sax playing and the music that he played the songs that he played brought back some great memories also i think domingo , enjoyed having us there seeing the looks on our faces and times we were able to get up and dance to these tunes domingo is not only a fine sax player , he also kind of look up to us as very interested couple who enjoy good music the day we left domingo was nice enough to come by and bid us a fond farewell once we reached home , we received a call from him to see if we had arrived safely thanks again , bob  flo bregande 
we want to live at this resort i got married here on july 26, 2008 it was the best decision i 've ever made we brought along 32 guests  we 're all planning to return on me  my husbands 1 year anniversary i mean , we can not wait ana was awesome as the wedding coordinator  far exceeded my expectations we paid for the excellence gold pkg but i brought a lot of things with me that were included in the pkg ( photographer , makeup , hair ) so ana made sure to offer something else in order to have our money well spent to be honest , it was so cheap anyway , we were not even planning on asking for a discount and the food for the reception was incredible i have no idea how people are complaining about food we 're from louisiana , where we 're known for our flavorful food , and my husband  i thought the food was great being that we got married there , we got a private dinner on the beach that was by far the best food i 've eaten in a long time it was 2 huge lobster tails , a steak ( kind of like a filet ) ,  mashed potatoes which i must say their potatoes are fantastic at any restaurant in excellence especially the pumpkin potatoes chez isabelle , the french restaurant , was my #1 fave a lot of friends with us agreed mexican was awesome , italian was awesome ,  breakfast in toscana was the 1st thing i thought about as soon as i opened my eyes ok , bottom line : food is perfectly fine hector  donell at the blue pool bar were the best i miss you guys but do not worry , we 'll be back next year okay , so i must be honest , we had one problem the honeymoon suite was sooooooooo not worth the money first , it looked exactly like everyone else 's room but had a jacuzzi  bed on the balcony well , our fault , b/c who wants to get in a hot tub outside in the middle of the summer that was pretty much what you paid for  well , we booked in november , so we really were not using our brains also , our air conditioner was not working too well i complained but they told me just to make sure all our doors were shut needless to say , they were shut , our air conditioning just sucked a mgr came one day  said it would be taken care of by that night  was actually kind of [ - - ] well , it was not working that night , so i went to the front desk  whoever it was that helped us went above  beyond what we expected he got us the most incredible room , with a very powerful air conditioner , also included in the excellence club i wish i could remember his name just to send a thank you  let the rest of the staff know how helpful he was to my husband  i i really could go on forever about how great this place was food : goodservice : greatentertainment : mostly good night club dancers were great wait staff : incrediblerooms : goodi have recommended excellence punta cana to every single person who has asked about my wedding you will not be disappointed 
totally pleased ( which can be hard to do ) i have been checking out reviews of the excellence since february and was truly expecting just an okay week nothing bad but probably nothing great either boy was i wrong i am probably one of the most picky , hard to please people that probably should not even do all inclusive places , but here i was trying the excellence punta cana when i tell you i literally could not find anything wrong with it my fiance was joking that i was upset that i had nothing to complain about the service was top notch , the rooms clean and beautiful pool and ocean clean and well kept around the area drinks were plentiful and i never had to wait for anything it really was a magical week and i could not get over that this was an all inclusive place no fuss over stupid beach or pool seats either which always drives me crazy in other places as well plenty of towels and seats for late birds like us the meals ( although i knew to lower my standards somewhat ) was really wonderful i really could find something to eat at every meal and at every restaurant thinking i was just going to be shuffling from one crappy buffet to another all week the restaurants were very nice , without having to make annoying reservations i might add and i left each night feeling like i just dined somewhere special even lunches if you wanted could be ordered right from a menu if you did not feel like doing the buffet even room service was an option at any time of the day , but we never did try that our plan really was to just relax all week but if you want to be on the go , there seemed to be things going on at all times of the day and night but in my opinion just book this place you wo not be sorry you may not love it like i did , but you are not going to be wishing that you were home either it was fantastic and i cannot wait to go back or try their other resorts in mexico or jamaica 
beautiful , but kind of disappointing after many months of reading tripadvisor reviews for excellence p , i felt convinced that i was making a great decision in choosing this resort as our honeymoon destination i read both positive and negative reviews , but still felt like that good reviews hugely outnumbered the negative reviews i felt like i could not go wrong with excellence after spending the week of 8/10 at the resort , i am not sure i chose the right resort arrival~ bumpy ride to  from the airport , but it really is not as bad as some people make it out to be ~ greeted with glasses of champagne~ check - in was painlessroom~ honeymoon suite ( did not upgrade to excellence club we did not think it was worth the extra money and after staying at the resort , we still feel like it 's not worth it ) ~ slightly smaller than it appears online~ we used the jacuzzi one time , and in retrospect , i think we would have been just as happy in a garden - view junior suite ~ ac did not work in our first room , so we asked to be moved to another room our request was accommodated and we were moved to a room with functioning ac do not be afraid to speak up if you think something is not working properly mini bar was filled with bottled water , juices  beer~ maid service twice a daypool~ just gorgeous ~ so many different options for relaxing : regular lounge chairs , lounge chairs under thatched - roof umbrellas , four - poster beds with canopies , etc ~ beware : there are showers by the pool so you can rinse sand off of your body before entering the pool - my husband was showering and was bit by some kind of bug that left huge welts on his back watch out for the beetle - looking bugs if you want a more low - key pool , check out the top level of the cascade pool by building 1 ocean~ dark , turquoise blue water super - strong waves they are strong enough to knock you over there is an undertow , so do not swim too far out tip : if you walk out to the ocean , then turn right and walk away from the resort , you 'll get to a segment of ocean without strong waves it is gentle and peaceful if you want to get away from the strong waves by the resort this is were i was most disappointed i thought with all of the food options , i would not have a problem , but i was wrong whatever i chose on the menu tasted just okay spice ( asian ) : i recommend the curry soup this was probably my favorite dish out of everything i ate ~ toscana ( italian ) : this place had breakfast  lunch buffets that were pretty decent the breakfast buffet has a bagel bar , an omelet bar , various cereals , milk , juice , bacon , hash browns , pastries , etc the lunch buffet had nachos ( watch out for stale chips ) , different pizzas to choose from , your choice of meat cooked in front of you , and a huge dessert bar agave ( mexican ) : the calamari is not fried , so watch out for that i was not really impressed with this place my husband said the fish was really , really good , though margaritas are a tad off lobster house : definitely not your maine lobster the lobsters are smaller and taste much different in my opinion we did not make it to barcelona ( mediterranean ) or chez isabelle ( french ) ~ my husband refused to eat any beef after day 2 at the resort it did not taste right to him he was not impressed with the hamburgers or steak served if you are at the resort when they have their local food festival , definitely have dinner on the beach they set up this huge area of tables and so much food - we thought it was for an outdoor wedding reception , but it was for anyone the food was actually really great at this festival , so do not miss it room service~ i really enjoyed the veggie pizza , of all things the tortilla soup was awesome , too one of the best things i tried all vacation spa~ because our ac was not working right in our room , the resort gave us 2 50- minute swedish massages at the spa totally relaxing and wonderful i would definitely go back for another spa treatment weather~ we knew we were travelling to the dr during rainy/hurricaine season , so we purchased trip insurance in case of bad weather it rained for an hour in the morning one day , but then stormed for an entire day at the end of our trip ( see next bullet ) highs were in the upper 80's  low 90's lows were still in the 80's tropical storm fay rolled through on the second - to - last day of our stay and it was kind of scary the resort lowered tarps to form walls around the open - air lobby all shows were cancelled and guests were playing board games in the lobby all flights were cancelled that day and those unfortunate folks ended up spending the night at the airport in a bus because all hallways are open - air , the rain made the floors super - slippery our elevator was broken in our building , so we had to use the stairs , which were also slippery , and i completely slipped and fell down an entire level wet marble is not the safest thing in the world other stuff~ mosquitos - definitely a problem bring bug spray/wipes if you run out , the resort is well - stocked with bug spray , so just ask if you need some screeching birds - for some reason , we were woken up by squawking birds all night the first night shopping - to the right and left of the resort ( walk on the beach to get there ) , there are these little huts with people who sell souvenir - type things be prepared to haggle these places are much cheaper than the stores on - site mamajuana - do not be scared this is the dr 's popular drink - served as a shot very cinnamon - y and spicy i thought it was quite yummy there is probably so much more i could write , but this is already so long 
would totally go again this place was muy excellente my husband and i had a blast from the moment we stepped off the plane to the moment we left we went with a larger group ( for a wedding ) and therefore our bus was only our group our driver and guide took us to a couple of places for our first taste of dominican culture and an ice cold presidente if there are any st louis cardinals fans out there , wear your pujols jersey with pride my father - in - law wore one into a little grocery shop and got a standing ovation they love their native son the bus ride was a little bumpy , but remember this is really a country which is just finding it 's legs as a destination vacation this is what i thought to be the drag part of the trip , but it was only a small fraction of the time , so i do not consider it a deal breaker the resort was immaculate really really beautiful the beach was gorgeous and the sand was like walking on powder i had never walked on sand so soft the waves were huge and the undertow was very strong , so be careful there were always plenty of cabanas , beach loungers , and hammocks on the shore for our group the place to be was the swim up bar called blue the pool was huge and dionel was always happy to serve your favorite drink with a smile and a little spanish lesson all the servers always had a smile on the restaurants were all right i tend to be one of the world 's pickiest eaters , but i always found something good to eat i highly recommend the grill it was not as formal as the others , and the steak was always good the entertainment at excellence was top notch the michael jackson show was so awesome and the entertainment staff was really good at getting people out on the dance floor and make the most of their vacation juan carlos and joel rocked like i said earlier we went down there for a wedding , and this report does an amazing job the set up on the beach was so beautiful , and ana rivas was so adept at handling every little detail that was a wedding i 'll treasure forever , even though it was not mine :0) oh , and if you are looking for souveniers look no further than nancy 's her shop is just down the beach from the resort you can actually see her sign while you are in the pool anyway , she 's very fair and her goods are in great shape and unlike the vendors allowed in the resort , nancy did not follow you aroung and bother you while you were shopping i bought some jewelry and her stuff is the real deal i hope this helped someone i will definately go back when time and finances permit 
had an amazing time my husband and i went to the excellence on our honeymoon , it was great we had never been to the dom before this and were a little nervous about what we were about to experience we were relieved 5 minutes after we arrived at the airport the airport transfer was perfect upoon arriving at theexcellence - the food was great , the shows were very fun and the scenery was beautiful another great thing about this hotel is that the entire staff speaks english - i was very nervous because i do not know much spanish - and it is their language the only thing i would have changed was the water - it is on the atlantic side and was very rough - it would not keep me from going back - in fact we may go back this nov 
pleasant and relaxing my partner and i spent 10 days at the hotel in february 2007, shortly after the changeover to the excellence brand it was magical - a beautiful landscape , great facilities and extremely helpful and pleasant service our room was huge , with a large whirlpool bathtub and a lovely view of the beach - try to get a front - row room if at all possible the superb orientation of the shoreline , as well as straight - to - the - hammock cocktail delivery , made the lazy afternoons on the sand a gloriously relaxing experience do not miss out on all the various restaurants the lobster grill and the mexican joint were especially good just remember to make a reservation well ahead overall , an a+ experience , well deserving of the name we 'll be back 
loved the excellence what a great trip we loved everything the pool and the ocean were wonderful the staff was so friendly and helpful lucas , the tennis pro , was great our honeymoon was perfect what luxury this place is the five course meals at every restaurant were spectacular the circus at night was the best show and domingo the saxaphone player was wonderful to listen to at night thanks for a memorable trip : ) 
another excellence experience at excellence punta cana pa aug 1-4th was booked at punta cana , as this was our 2nd trip with excellence group resorts we stayed in february at playa mujeres  decided to spend our 50th birthday at excellence punta cana , it was marvelous the grounds are beautiful , rooms are spacious as they are all suites , food  drinks delicious , but most of all , the service was in a league of their own we have been to many other all inclusives , this resort by far supasses all of them may i just add that this staff went out of their way to make us feel as though we were the only guests there , especially the excellence club staff robert , ana ,  maria isabel we came in one evening to find balloons filled the room , rose petals in our jacuzzi , champagne chilling , chocolate covered strawberries  a big birthday cake 50  never looked so good after this trip we are finished in search of the perfect spot , if there is not an excellence resort , you wo not be seeing us we lay on their beautiful beach listening to the waves , drinking from a coconut ( coco locos ) , seemed like we were living a dream to sum it up , it 's simply heaven on earth 
great place , service could be better we spent last week at excellence punta cana with another couple that we travel with quite a lot after all the reviews that i had read and the questions that i had asked and the posts i read on the message board i truly was expecting an great time and for the most part that was what i got , but there were a few disappointments along the way that cast a shadow on the trip first let me say that the dominican republic is a very poor country and they are trying hard but the infrastructure is not there yet so yes the roads outside the town of punta cana are pretty rough , some of the roads are not paved and there are bad pot holes i am amazed that the driver of our bus finds his way i would be completely lost there are no road signs to speak of yet , for me anyway , the bus ride and the cab ride i took were an adventure and allowed me to really see the country none of this is under the control of or in any way affects my feelings for excellence the resort is really and truly beautiful and is everything that you see in the pictures upon arrival we were greeted by the bellhop , given a tag for our luggage and escorted to the front desk check in was very smooth , we were offered a glass of champagne and in no more then 15 mins i was looking at the beautiful beach and sipping my first drink from the caf? kafe beach bar our room was in building 4, first floor we had a great view of the gardens and the room was very clean we did have a bit a problem with air conditioning during the week , the room was damp most of the time and the air did not get very cold however , we did not contact maintenance about this because it was livable and we were not in the room that long anyway be warned the beds are very hard , order a pillow top , i did not think to do this until the middle of the week and then decided not to trouble the maid she worked hard and long enough the housekeeping staff , like the rest of the staff works a 15 hour day , 11 days straight and then off for 3 days and while i do not know what housekeeping earns i do know that the entertainment staff earns the equivalent of $300 usd a month they kept our room clean and our mini bar was always stocked i had read that the food was not that great before i left and i have decided either i don?? know what good food is , my expectations are very low or the reviews that i read regarding food were looking for the american version of their meals i thought the food was wonderful and i know that everyone in my group thought the same thing the only place that they were not happy with but i was is the lobster house , i do recommend that when you go there you should order the lobster steamed with garlic butter , the grilled tends to be a little slimy i would like to say which one was my favorite but the truth is that all of them were wonderful i don?? want to forget lunch on the beach every day was wonderful , especially the dominican rice i am not going to dwell on how beautiful the beach is , it just is yes the water is a little rough but that to was a lot of fun and we did not see it as a negative the only issue that we had was the overall service there are some highlights , kenny who works the bar in agave as well as caf? kaffe , is great , he remembered i didn?? like the fruit in my drink and was always smiling altagracia who brought us our drinks the couple of days that she was working the beach was great she always had a smile and kept us in cold drinks all day alexandra who is with the entertainment staff and really wonderful she always has a smile and although she was not able to convince us to do anything other then watch , she still tried and was always fun in trying beyond that we were disappointed overall with the service and in most cases it was the small things that added up to a big annoyance the hostess at the grill who rolled her eyes at us when we asked for a table for eight or the waiter working in toscana that forgot to bring us additional silver ware or fill our coffee cups at breakfast there were never any clean beach towels out and when we asked at the front desk for them we were asked if we had check the different locations on the resort and then were told we would have to wait for 30 minutes for them you would think that at least one day we would be able to find them with out having to go to the desk the hostess that guards the desk at toscana and chased my friend down because she walked out with a glass of tomato juice just added one more small thing on the ever growing pile i also was disappointed in our inability to have a snack in the afternoon at the pool other then a pizza ( which by the way is very good but not every day ) we could not go into the grill order a hamburger and take it back to the pool to enjoy you have to eat in the restaurants , which in the grand scheme of things is not a big deal but a minor annoyance that added to the stack of minor things that added to a major annoyance i consider this a 5 star resort , yes and no , the resort itself , the grounds , the beach yes , the food , yes the staff , i think has a ways to go in pampering their guests we have been to several different resorts in the caribbean and while this was not the worst by far it was not the best secrets in mexico , i think is comparable on the luxury end but better on service and couples negril , while not as luxurious , their service exceeds excellence hands down and still remains our favorite 
fantastic holiday and a beautiful hotel we just returned from a fantastic time at this hotel the setting is beautiful - the layout , the pools , the rooms and the beach - it is all lovely food was delicious - particularly the french place and the grill the service and variety of drinks were amazing - staff were really friendly it was clean and bright and there was always something goign on if you did not want to just lounge by the pool it is couple orientated though - so many people on their honeymoon and i would not go as a group the excursions did not offer much variety and were expensive but the one we went on ( carribbean festival ) was great for me as a beginner at snorkeling however you do not have to leave the hotel in a week really great time and will treasure fond memories 
loved every minute we just returned home from our best vacation ever it was the most beautiful beach we have been to the pools were fun too all of the services that we received were excellent the food was better than we expected our favorite restaurants were the french , mediterranean and italian ( skip the lobster house ) the shows were good we did not bother with any excursions as we did not want to leave the beach and pool tip : remember to keep your balcony door closed or else the a/c shuts off automatically rolando , the tennis instructor was fantastic 
the entire resort experience was wonderful service was wonderful except at the lobster house for some reason there was only ever one server at a time then entertainment was great each evening there were plenty of daily activities planned without too much pressure to be involved the entertainment team did a great job of being involved in making activities fun and getting guests involved without over doing it the facilities were wonderful agave , the mexican restaurant , was the best get a beach towel first thing in the morning and keep it with you the welcome was great and all the staff was more than accommodating at all times i would definitely visit again 
dont beleive the good reviews , we were fooled too let me preface this review by apologizing for the length , but there are many things that needed to be mentioned being a young traveler (24 years old ) it does not take much to impress me , and excellence just did not live up to my expectations of a so called 5 star resort we arrived late because of an 8 hour american airlines delay and the punta cana airport was a circus of hundreds of people crammed to get to their bags the transfer to the hotel during the night was very bad the roads as is stated on this website numerous times are very bad when we finally arrived at around 10pm we were given a tour of the room when the employee proceeded to show us the minibar , it still had drinks from the previous occupants he yelled for another employee but quickly gave up and said we would get it changed in the morning we went to the only late night place to get food , a pizza place called oregano the pizza was good but we did learn something very quickly people were tipping the employees we were told all tips were included , but we decided to tip to not appear to be cheap the next morning we went to the buffet breakfast at tuscana , there were plenty of choices , not many of them all too good the choices i made were stale or just did not taste fresh the fruit juice was good but always warm after breakfast we headed to the beach , found a nice hut with a great view of a blue but very rough ocean the resort was not full at all so a lot of spots were open there were bartenders who worked hard to bring us drinks , but the beach was understaffed we went to the bar to get just as many drinks as we were served we met one very nice bartender kenny and he was what the other employees should be like anyways , we were approached everyday by salesmen soliciting off - site excursions on the beach they were rude and pushy and would not go away they are apparently allowed to walk the beach because it is public but when i later saw him holding an excellence pizza box i grew suspicious we tried to walk the beach a little , but in either direction are huts with vendors and when you walk past them on the beach they approach you ( harassing ) and tell you to come to their hut that was the first and last time we walked the beach we ate lunch at the grill which was average the burger did not taste good the best thing i had was the french fries we had dinner at spice the next night which was good , we ended up eating there twice the next morning we ate breakfast at the grill which was better than the buffet at toscana but still nothing impressive after spending the day at the beach we noticed that the room had been cleaned , but under further inspection the only thing that was done was the bed was made and the floors were mopped we also noticed that none of the towels were changed back to the room and its problems later , but the maid service here gets a huge f everyday something was wrong we tried the grill for dinner that night the steak was good but the mashed potatoes were cold we did not send it back but it ruined my dinner the deserts every night were the same 3-4 cakes and if you were lucky melted ice cream ( which tasted gross ) every night after dinner we went to the lobby for the shows , which were better than expected however the saxophone player before the shows plays the same 5 songs every single night ( two of which are pretty woman and i want to hold your hand ) , it got so repetitive after awhile it became humorous the next morning we went to the grill for what turned out to be an interesting breakfast some of the tables along the edge of the restaurant had a nice ocean view we requested one of those tables , which happened to be dirty the hostess seemed confused but she sat us at a different table while she cleaned the other she was not overwhelmed because there were only 2 tables and 5 waiters plus her anyways , the table was cleared off , but we noticed she cleaned the wrong one , instead of cleaning the ocean view table , she clears off the table with a large wooden pole in front of it i told her that was not the one we wanted and she very obviously rolled her eyes at me and said something in spanish before cleaning the right table lunch at the buffet turned out to be even worse as both my girlfriend and myself got food poisoning and were up all night the food for lunch at the buffet was old , stale and terrible the next morning we decided to eat in being we were both recovering from being ill so we called into room service and ordered breakfast an hour passed and i called to check the status they told me it would be another 20-30 minutes i told them to cancel the order another day i tried to order room service for lunch at 11:15 the woman on the phone told me i couldnt order lunch before 11:30 i asked her if she could at least write the order down and have it sent once lunch was served she seemed confused and i didnt push for it in my 7 day stay we did not once actually get room service we headed to the beach and ate at the bbq they had on the beach which we discovered late into the trip because the resort is large , i would estimate the 90% who did not sit in the area of the bbq would not eat there now onto the problems with the room our toilet had a hard time flushing , sometimes appeared to be on the verge to overflow , the handles on the hot tub came off and did not work you needed to use your hand to turn the metal faucet the screen on the patio door was also bent the satellite tv went out several times per day , a problem not only experienced by us because i heard people speaking about it we also both got what appears to be bedbugs probably because they never changed the linens we continued to attempt to have fun and signed up for the snorkeling trip to catalina island we signed up for it at the excellence but it was not exactly run by them the two guides , miguel and franklin were extremely friendly and funny once we got to the boat we were surprised to see the condition of the docks and the boat the crew consisted of people who just sat there and did nothing but take our expensive excursion for free the double decker boat hit very bad waves on the way back , and as an experienced fisherman i can tell you that the captain did not know what he was doing our final day at excellence was a summation of the entire vacation after another hard night because of the food , we took a little more time to pack then expected we needed to meet in the lobby for our transfer to the airport at 11:30am we got to the lobby at 11:15am , just in time for a few minutes to grab a quick bite at the breakfast buffet we were shocked when after we sat ourselves a waiter came to us and told us that breakfast was over while he was saying this i am watching the other guests at the buffet getting their second and third helpings of food i told him we couldnt go to the sit down breakfast because our taxi was coming in only a few minutes 
what a big disappointment the hotel staff was less than accommodating the room was ok but the bed was hard as a rock the food was good but the wait staff was slow and less than cooperative the mexican restaurant agave is a waste of time and you had to wait for dinner every night and they would not take reservations a friend of ours slipped on the steps ( no signs to show the step down ) had to be rushed to the clinic and all the resort was concerned about was that they do not sue them they did not do anything to help our friend ( no offer to pay the room or get them a special room ) their is definitely a bad attitude with the service staff i will never go there again and neither will any of our friends 
average not excellent this is my first time staying at the excellence resort and enjoyed my stay but would stay at another excellence resort pros : resort  beachthe resort is always clean and well kept beach was very nice the water was clear and the sand was soft they have plenty of seats and umbrella for everyone , so need to wake up early to claim your spot roomhotel room is clean and spacious we did see a few insects in our room when we came back from dinner two nights out of the 4 nights i really like the jacuzzi in our bedroom staffstaffs are excellent they are very friendly and nice all spoke english and i did not have a hard time communicating with the staff the resort is catered toward americans they offered almost every thing in english the tv stations were in english with cnn , stars , showtime , etc which is great for me oh by the way they have a porn channel cons : roomthe bed is very firm so we had a hard time getting a good night sleep toward the end of the trip i asked for a pillow top mattress to be placed on the bed but it never came i would recommend you asking for the pillow top mattress the first night if the bed is too firm for you customer servicesservices could be better i went to one other all inclusive resort in puerto rico and their services was better than excellence we paid extra to get the excellence club services and i don?? think it worth it we got to use the club room where we had snack , food , drink , internet services , and dvd check out , but the extra attention was not there i would not recommend the club service as mentioned earlier , i had to ask for a pillow top mattress 3x and i still didn?? get it we didn?? get turn down services a few days we were there i guess since it is a big resort , housekeeping may have a hard time keeping up with the rooms food and entertainmentthe food was okay i had better all inclusive resort food some night we had to wait for 30 minutes to be seated in the restaurant they have a wide selection of activities to do at the resort they have cooking , dancing , and scuba classes every night they have a different show to entertain the guest they also have a wide variety of sport activities to do at the sport bar ( pool , air rifle , archery , ping - pong , tennis , cards , etc ) airport feei was not aware that we had to pay $10 per person at the airport thanks goodness we had some cash on us so make sure you bring cash vendorsvendors were very pushy i didn?? like being bother at the beach every day with people trying to get me to sign up for the different activities on the beach i understand that they are trying to make a living but it could be very bothersome shoppingi highly don?? recommend you shop at the airport the airport was charging 2x more than the resort there are a few shops at the end of the resort and i heard people got great deal from i didn?? know that there were shops at the end of the resort so i shopped at the stores in the resort make sure you ask for a discount 
this place is great this was our second stay at excellence , first was apr 07 honeymoon and july 27th - july1st 08 we booked with michelle rivers at goaway travel i booked this trip in march ) we had a few problems with the front desk but after the problems were fixed it was complete paradise trip started in nj on continental and we were given the bathroom row seats people should learn to keep potty talk to themselves 9had the same seats home to ugh ) arriving at puj was fine you pay the $10 charge and its as easy as pie to get your luggage and find your transportation we were traveling with another couple we were the only 4 on the van which was nice vip transportation was good the ride to the hotel is probably around 50 mins or so but it goes fast ( really fast the way they drive you go through their town and the country side it makes you appreciate what you have arriving at the hotel a luggage man greets you ( i wish i knew his name b/c he was extremly nice ) takes your bags hands you a cool cloth to wash your hands with and then a cocktail waitress brings you a welcome drink the front desk at first seemed great hector was the gentleman that was checking us in he told us to get lunch and our rooms should be ready he told us what ever we need during our stay to please come to him and he will take care of it no problem what so ever he was very coy we had lunch room wasnt ready so we went to the bar by the beach we had a few cocktails took in the scene it was fine we went to our rooms building 2 and my cousins room had air and ours did not and we were looking at the road i booked early and expected a better view like i had with our honeymoon plus no air was not exceptable i called downstairs and they tried to tell me no rooms available maybe tomorrow etc etc ( the bartenders told us the hotel was slow when we were there ) i could have handled the view but not having air no way my husband went down the stairs to see hector and he said nothing can be done i went down and hector said sorry well i called my travel agent michelle rivers and she got on the horn with the hotel we had to stay in that room the first night but michelle got all of us moved to a poolside room the next day , it was suppose to be before 1 but didnt happen til 4pm hector ran everytime i wanted to see him the second room for my cousin was fine , freezing cold nice view , our toliet wasnt flushing unless you pulled off the tank lid and pulled the chain we found out during the night the air wasnt working any longer either i called down to the desk about the toliet the night we got in the room and were told someone will be up to fix it that never happened the next morning we stopped at the desk told them about the air and we were told it will be fixed immediatley i went back to the room at 5:30pm and no air what so ever i called down to the desk and was told we will send someone up i marched downstairs with my husband and asked for the manager and he is never available , we had to get pretty angry before we were handed a key to go check out another room this room was in building 3 and the air worked it was great relaxation was to really begin im not usually super picking but i expected air ( sometimes the electrcity goes off but only for a few mins ) our view this time was partial oceanafter the room mess there is nothing negative i could say about this place the food was good if you were not full you could get another dinner we ate at asia ( real good ) lobster house and agave ( mexican ) one night we skipped dinner all together and sat at the martini bar talking with some nice people we had just met i am a beer drinker ( coors light ) but the presidente light was good and the beer we found on our last night one was real good you just had to ask the bartender to put them in ice if you wanted hard liquir there was plenty jack daniels , johnny walker , finlandia , absolute , stoli etc etc tanquary the waitress on the beach altragrassia is superb a super nice woman the beach is beautiful the waves were rough but im use to that from the jersy shore the main pool was warm the casading pool is the place to lay by quiet and relaxing julio the entertainment supervisor awesome person hes very nice all the help ( except the front desk ) are extremly sweet and helpful they bend over backwards for you the entertainment is cheesy ( the shows at night ) and they are the same from last year but we had late dinners a couple of drinks and you are ready for bed around 11pm do try the mama juana shot the comedian guy at the martini bar is really funny he is there mon and fri nights we tipped everyone and they so deserve it i gave the maids a small gift each day along with a couple of dollars ( a box of crayons , magic markers , candles , nail polish , scented hand lotion i had read its the small things some of them do not have especially school supplies ) we would get flowers on the bed , a wash cloth once in awhile , and designs with the towels on the bed the beds are hard but so what the rooms are large and the tub is the best my husband did enjoy channel 21 :0) please do the horseback riding you get a free half hour and it is so much fun bring $25 with you because they sell u a cd and a bottle of rum that has your pic on it with the horses my hubby told the guide i could ride and he let me run and run he went out of his way to make sure i had a blast it was a memory i will cherish we tipped him too give this resort a try u will not be sorry , i could go on and on about how great it is another thing if you do not want to get off the beach they bring lunch to you along with drinks all day long just remember to tip they deserve it 
excellence , attitude  firstly the excellent part of our trip from july 3-17 have read a few poor reviews recently where we must be on a different planet to them the one that described dr as a dump was basically offensive if people did a bit of planning they would know the ride is long and bumpy ( but funny at times ) and that the waves are strong , but still did not stop some arrogant fools ignoring the lifeguards whistles basically , we found everything to be more - or - less spot - on contacted ta reviewers ( thanks to all ) prior to going and requested ( and got ) room 3207 which although termed garden view actually had as good a ocean view as most of the rooms room was very comfortable and always spotlessly cleaned we are beach people and found it fantastic at our end of the resort as an early riser i always got a good position with a palm umbrella for shade from the weather , which was superb throughout food ranged from good to very good to excellent the toscana lunch buffet surely had something for everyone evening meals around 8pm usually involved a wait but with bars near to every restaurant this was not a problem favourite overall was spice and also enjoyed the beach meal/buffet ( every tuesday evening ) that they put considerable effort into staff throughout were extremely friendly and helpful , with the service at the cafe kafe bar outstanding overall an outstanding complex secondly the attitude i 've read it on here before that the rude people know who they are i think they do not know who they are as their behaviour is totally normal to them i must stress it is a minority but why do people go to the bar and immediately demand a drink without thinking there may be someone waiting before them this demand is without a please , although they sometimes grunted 'gracias ' through clenched teeth the bar excellence staff are clever though and suss the rude/arrogrant ones out , tending to serve as requested but not fawning over them as they would want a second exapmle of attitude involved our neighbours in 3208 the girl was a bridesmaid at one of the several beautiful weddings we witnessed at the block 1,2,3 end unfortunately her and her partner embarked on very loud rows just after 2am on 3 consecutive nights , which usually ended with her screaming 'you 've never loved me have you lastly the morning entertainment as stated i 'm an early riser and the morning sunrise was superb additionally , i witnessed the great efforts of the staff who cleaned the beach these people really are the unsung hero 's of this resort this was followed by the exercise routines of a ) an ungainly speedo - man and his lithe 'thonged ' girlfriend and b ) of a middle - aged lady who power walked topless along the beach and repeated this at varioius times of the day i take my hat off to these people as their energetic excursions made me feel a little bit guilty overall - excellent and i have emailed my thanks to the resort and separately to the beverages manager for the great service 
2nd trip to excellence and not the last service was beyond our expectations let me start by covering the basics briefly the grounds are immaculate and gorgeous , the beach is breathtaking , the pools are awesome , the rooms are perfect , the food delicious , the service everywhere , excellent everything was as perfect as it was last year when it comes to the basics we are getting married at excellence next july and we knew this was our wedding location before we even got engaged and when we did get engaged , we did not have to compare resorts or feel like we were stuck between two places this place is it however , i recently found out i have a serious food allergy and i was very nervous about eating anywhere , let alone outside of the country i was very nervous that a resort would not be able to accomodate my food allergy i did figure because of the excellent service last year , that they would be the most likely to come through for me so that eased my mind so i brought special sauces to cook my food in , special food and snacks and guess what we barely used any of it the staff at excellence went above and beyond to ensure my health safety and enjoyment of my trip there are some people i must give a compliment to for their outstanding service : chef berthold ~chief executive chef ~ i can not thank him enough for everything he did for me during my stay he went above and beyond my expectations regarding my food allergy he came to our lunch and dinner everyday before and after our meals to make sure the food was safe for me on top of that , for the weekly beach party and pool soiree , he would walk me through every buffet station to go over what was in each dish i ate like a queen he even had a cook cut up a lime for me to put on my bug bites at the beach party they also bought a special pan to cook my lunches and dinners in so i would not get sick talk about 5 star service i never even felt restricted with the exception of dessert but we were too full every time to even contemplate that i never imagined i would have such personalized and friendly service and i doubt i would receive that kind of service at any other resort he is a kind and an amazing man i know he truly enjoys his job excellence is sure lucky to have him elvira ~head concierge~ she was so accomodating even before i arrived we spoke so many times over the internet and she answered all my questions everyday i would let her or one of the other concierges ( thanks carolina and fior ) know where i would be eating that afternoon and evening and they would have someone bring my pan and sauces ( the ones we never even had to use ) to the restaurant she is very sweet and always wanted to know if everything was going okay roberto~club manager~i never actually got to meet him because we did not stay in the club , but he was also extremely helpful prior to my arrival to make sure everything with my food allergy was being taken care of rosaura~hostess~she was so sweet and really understood my need for special attention and always got chef berthold right away for me she even gave me a special gift for us to remember her by now , as for our wedding , ana the wedding planner is awesome she took the time to show us pictures while we were there and help make some decisions and arrangements with us she was very concerned about my allergy as well , and was very happy that everything worked out so amazingly she is definitely a sweetheart because she put up with me emailing her everyday with questions about the wedding prior to our trip and even still thank you so much ana she sets up amazing weddings and makes them really special i ca not wait for our wedding day the beach party they have every tuesday is exactly how i picture the wedding reception they really know how to set up a beautiful party also , domingo the saxophonist is out of this world we are definitely hiring him for our wedding and we even bought two of his cds soon he 'll be famous in the united states and europe he is really the best saxophonist i 've ever heard make sure you take the time to enjoy his beautiful music after the nightly shows luciano , the entertainment manager is so nice i loved the circus music and asked what it was , and he made a copy of the cd for me the one and only thing i would complain about and i hope the resort hears this is how they shut off the lights in some walkways way too early and its so pitch black out there you dont know where you are walking or who is around you it 's one thing tto do it after everything has been closed for a while , but several times , we were either at the cafe bar or at the sports bar and closed the place and as soon as the bar shuts the lights down , all the lights surrounding the area and beyond shut off too they should considering leaving the lights on for at least 15 minutes so people can get back to their rooms safely otherwise , someone could get hurt i think they want people to use the lobby area for walking at night for safetyreasons , but sometimes it just doesnt work that way depending on where you are at the time , and it ends up defeating the purposed about trying to keep the guests safe hope you hear me , excellence i can still not get over the outstanding , specialized service we received our entire stay i 've been raving about since we got home this is what makes excellence stand out above the rest ( ca not forget the breathtaking beach too ) we ca not wait to return next year for our beautful wedding and fantastic honeymoon 
the name sums it all up my girlfriend and i have just returned from a nice getaway at the excellence pc we spent 6 days ( jul 27- aug 1) at the resort and i do not think anything could top our experience we are a young couple ( age 21) but are not into the party scene and would prefer each others company relaxed and alone so let us start from the beginning shall we airport and transfer : the airport will be something new to anyone used to the regular airports and terminals in the other places you get off the plane and the airplane looks like a giant hut with palm leaves on the top you have to pay 10 dollars to get into the country which is pretty dumb , but its only a one time deal everything went very smoothly in the airport and meeting with our transfer ride the ride is like everyone says it is , bumpy but it is also very exciting , make sure you have your camera out and waiting to take pictures my foot kept stomping on the imaginary footbrake because they do not know how to drive , but we still got there safely resort and crew : gorgeous the grounds are very well maintained we arrived at 1 but were not allowed to check in until 3 so we relaxed at the martini bar and met a nic couple who were doing the same thing moslty everyone will strike up a conversation and are very friendly everyone that worked that were always smiling and happy to help in any way it was nice to see that they cared insated of just doing their jobs to do them rooms : we reserved a garden view room which was fantastic the backyard area was secluded by bushes and we had our own little hammock gorgeous jacuzzi and oversized bed the onyl problem was the electricity would go out from time to time when we were getitng ready for dinner no big deal though just walk over to the breakers and flip the switch and the power will be restored food : a five star resort should have five star food , right thats exactly what we got the food was unbelievable i highly recommend the crab struffed shrimp at barcelona and my girls favorite was the whole fish fillet from barcelona as well spice isnt really worht going to unless you know oriental food or like sushi i got the sweet and sour pork which was very good , but thats all i really knew what was in it we didnt go to agave ( mexican ) because my girlfriend does not enjoy that type of food , but i did look at the menu and there were a lot of very good entrees oh yes and of course alchohol do not drink mama juana ill say again do not drink it i asked the bartender for a good shot and she gave me that it was rum that sat in a jar of wood chips other then that everything else was good dirty banana and bananamama were the best drinks definitley beach , pool , activites : the beach was excellent the waves were a little rough so if you 're not a strong swimmer dont go out too far and bring lots of sun tan lotion because you burn very easily the pool big deal seen one seen them all , but it is very relaxing on one end and then the other end is for entertainment with volleyball and water polo i read some other reviews about get out to the pool and beach early because they 're taken up it may just be because its the offseason but it was very easy to get a shaded beach chair at 1030 in the morning when you read the activites sheet they give you in your room for the next day do not believe it it said they had a baseball game on the beach one day which i was excited about and they didnt have it and another night a texas holdem tournament and they didnt have it casino isnt to die for but there is enough to do so you can blow or make a little money casino was fun the later it got the more packed it got make sure you take advantage of the horse riding overall this was a gorgeous resort and we both have a feeling we will be back awfully soon 
great honeymoon at the excellence my wife and i just got back from a honeymoon trip to the excellence on saturday (7/26) we had a great time and i definitely recommend the dominican republic as a great alternative to some other carribean/mexican destinations that get alot more buzz quick rundown on how things went : getting to the airport : arrived monday 7/21 on a flight from nashville to punta cana ( via miami ) it 's a nice touch that the airport is small enough that you take steps from the plane directly to the tarmac the laid back atmosphere starts immediately you are surrounded my some beautiful ladies in supposed dominican dress ( did not see anyone else wearing that ) who corral you for a picture that you can buy for $8 bucks when you come back to the punta cana airport for your trip home did not buy ours because we were both half blink airport to resort : take vip travel to get to the resort - they have big vans and good drivers that make you feel safe on what is an interesting ride huge pot holes , veering motorcycles and bicycles , occasional roaming livestock , etc provide obstacles here and there but contrary to some of the comments i have read , i never once felt like i was in any danger if you have no tolerance for reduced infrastructure standards , then you probably should stay home anyway the ride is only about an hour and ten minutes if you take vip because they do not stop at a bunch of other resorts on the way arriving at the resort : huge lobby , soothing music , friendly folks working the desk , helpful concierge , and being handed glasses of champagne right when you walk in make for an awesome arrival after a long day of traveling room accomodations : i wrestled with the idea of upgrading the the excellence club but after seeing our jr swim - up suite , we were content enough to keep our original accomodations the room is decently spacious and the back of our room opened up to a pool ( with a convenient swim up bar within about 50 feet you know ) the rooms were clean ( a tiny bit musty like any other beach house i have ever been to so bring some scented candles ) and they were decent sized all the fixtures were nice and the fridge was kept stocked with presidente beer ( awesome local brew ) , bohemia beer , fruit juices , bottled water , and sodas only slight drawback ( and i preface this by saying i had zero problems sleeping ) was that the beds were a little hard workout facility is really nice too hit that most mornings and the equipment was really nice food : the food was pretty good a whole bunch of restaurants , each with its on genre of food ( french , mexican , japanese , mediterranean , lobster , etc ) i crack up reading some of the complaints on here because i can tell that some people expected food on par with the finest dining in manhattan it 's not that good but you can eat pretty much any time of day and the food is good spice ( japanese fusion ) was my favorite toscana also has a good breakfast buffet that we went to every morning get the fresh fruit smoothies you wont be disappointed bars are plentiful by the pools and beach and folks are walking around taking orders all over the place be careful with the coco locos , banana mamas , etc more alcohol in those fruity drinks than you can taste ask for a grande presidente or they will bring you a beer in a cup about the size of a shot glass ok , i am exaggerating but you will want the tall beer beach/pool : pools are awesome but the chairs/beds fill up fast plus , past early afternoon , the yellow beach towels are hard to come by grab a couple extra in the morning the clientele varies from the pools to the beach partyers seem to be in the pools all day long , beach is more relaxing the beach is unbelievably beautiful by the way - - there is a life guard but half the beach is black flagged ( do not go in ) , the other half is red ( exert caution ) the weather was beautiful while we were there but you do want to be careful because the waves can be pretty big say hi to victor for me he wears an orange polo and tries to sell beachgoers atv trips every morning none of the vendors are pushy though give them a kind no thank you and they will go away staff : the staff was exceptionally pleasant/helpful but there was occasionally an underlying feeling of unhappiness that you could sense from time to time it didnt impact my enjoyment of the trip but i did spend some time wondering if the folks there really liked working there or not that seems to be a pretty common theme at resorts i 'd probably be annoyed waiting on a bunch of demanding/often irrational patrons too most speak enough english to get the drift of what you are asking for language barrier is not a problem definitely tip them a little bit they go above and beyond and there is no way to know how much of hotel fees are actually making it down to the people doing the hard work entertainment : we didnt really take a whole lot of advantage of the shows , excursions , etc but there is a desk in the lobby that can provide any information you want on trips ( including the trip back to the airport ) we watched perfect couple one night which was a dating game and it was hilarious that reminds me - no kids at this resort do not come here if looking for mtv spring break do come here if looking to chill out and relax getting back : some of the punta cana airport was unairconditioned but it is a very nice facility the departing terminal we were in was new , there was a wendy 's if you miss american food , and the staff at the airport is helpful and friendly the customs/baggage claim in miami is brutal avoid that airport if you can ( though i had similar expriences in boston and chicago so i figure it is the same pain in the you know what everywhere ) all in all , i recommend it and hope to go back to the d 
" excellence " not really ever since my boyfriend and i met , we go away once a year , for about one week we have always picked the best resorts in the caribean and have never been dissapointed however , this time we were it was really unfortuante , but it 's not what we expected from the moment we arrived it was one let down after another our flight was delayed in new york , we were supposed to leave jfk at 8:55, but did not actually leave until 11:45 we arrived at the airport in dr ( which really resembled gilligan 's island the airport was composed of huts ) we were exited on the runway and then charged $15 00 a person before being allowed into the baggage area ( crazy ) luggage took forever and then the bus ride to the hotel was an endless journey , it took over an hour and half , with no water and pot holes that looked liked craters usually , the buses that provide transportation to and from the resorts , provide beverages the streets do not have traffic lights nor stop signs , everyone cuts everyone off , it did not matter if you were riding a car or a bull upon arriving at the hotel that 's when the party really begins our room was dirty and sandy , the jacuzzi was stained ( i did not even want to ask from what ) the shower stall was very dirty and had terrible stains , the overall smell in the room was a terrible funk and still we were trying to make the best of it we went to the front desk to what could be done , and all we were offered was the opportunity to upgrade our status to the excellence club for $150 extra a night plus tax and gratuities ( we were going to be there 7 nights ) we of course declined and just asked for different room , they however could not accomodate us , what they did offer was a pillow top mattress the food was not good , our first night there we went to a restaurant called spice , it was supposed to be an asian restaurant , it was far from edible , let alone asian i ordered sweet and sour pork , what they bought out was pepper steak sesame , my boyfriend ordered something with shrimp , he got , curried shrimp we were so confused the following night we figured we would try the lobster house i mean who can mess up lobster first we waited to be seated for one hour , ( they do not accept reservations ) when we were seated and ordered , we waited an hour and half for our lobster because the chef had dissappeared no one knew where he was there was a lot of arguing , not only the patrons but also the staff when the food finally came , it was nasty , my lobster was burnt and slimy and looked alive , it still had all it 's legs and it 's eyes the only restaruant that was descent was the mexican agave this one we discovered two nights before we left the hamburgers tasted like they had been dipped in the ocean not everyone in the hotel was very nice , they tended to be a bit snoty , we asked for washcloths they acted like they did not know what they were staff requested tips at times ( not often , but they did when they had a chance ) and we were told that if we tipped them we would be taken care of , if not , then you know the rest i hate to say this , but i hated it , we did not enjoy ourselves , everytime we tried , something would always go wrong as for the beach if the waves did not attack you the beach vendors surely would did i forget to mention that the electricity went out twice daily every single day not just once or twice , every day , and it was not because of my blowdryer ( it usually is , but not this time , because i left mine in ny ) later we found out that it happened throughout the entire resort it was an experience i can honestly say that i will never forget punta cana 
got back from the resort two weeks ago , and i am dying to go back we had a fantastic time , and my only regret is that we didnt stay longer beach is beautiful walk down to the log for calm waters it is like a pool you get the best of both worlds : waves to jump or calmness to relax in the entertainers were awesome they were friendly , upbeat and fun thank you alexandra , franklin , juan carlos , joel , joanna , rolando and wilkens you made our trip exciting restaurants - we ate at toscana ( which we disliked immensely ) barcelona was okay agave and chez isabelle were wonderful rooms - were pretty and spacious the only downside was that one of the two rooms we occupied definitely had a smell , permeating the entrance area of the room the other room was fine pool - warm , relaxing our only complaint is that some people hog floaties they will keep them next to their beds even when they are not using them they are not meant to be removed form the pool , but some people ignore that rule , and refuse to share despite this we were able to find them by swimming the length of the long pool when we needed tips - we never felt like anyone expected a tip bloody marys at the martini bar were good , however my dirty martini at the club alegria was terrible shows - two were great , a singer ( cant remember his name ) and the circus act we found the other two shows to be corny - the stars show and the magic show we didnt sit through either one the belly dancing warm up act was terrible i have taken 3 belly dancing classes and am pretty sure i could have performed at the same par the only thing that did bother me was that it seemed impossible to get food to eat by the pool or beach the only option was pizza or the beach bbq there are no snacks available at all ice cream there is not what we were used to the flavors taste nothing like they are supposed to strawberry tasted like some sort of bubble gum vanilla does not exist bugs - we only got bitten our last night - the night we were outside for a few hours , and suspect that our bug spray had worn off the other nights we were bite free which we achieved by spraying bug spray before we went out for dinner every night i had so much fun and relaxation that i am trying to get my group to go again next year 
excellente , indeed july 13-23, 2008everyone has their own experience and their own lens as to how they define an excellent  vacation we just returned from 11 days at the resort and are already excited about returning next spring we travel frequently throughout the caribbean and tend to think that we have high expectations regarding our own definition of an excellent travel experience we did not experience any of the problems others have expressed here on trip advisor the resort is a slice of paradise some thoughts that maybe have not been expressed by everyone else rooms : we stayed in the excellence club and will not choose this option next time our room was in an ideal location in building #7, which is in the center of the resort the same identical swimout room in building #6 would have cost us around $900 less for ten nights , and we would have been just fine without the other ammentities that come with the excellence upgrade like other resorts we have visited in the caribbean , our room had a bit of a musty smell since we had read about this issue in other reviews , we went to our local lowes and purchased a product that we placed in the corner of the room , and it immediately took the smell out of the air we found everyone to be friendly and helpful the service was a bit slow at times at night when dining in one of the restaurants you 've probably read all of the reviews about tipping it was a bit of a shock to see how many people do not tip the staff does not push you for a tip and the service looked like it was the same regardless of whether foks tipped or not we feel , however , that if we have the money to go on this type of trip , we should also be able to express our appreciation to the folks who go out of their way to make our experience a great one please consider taking a wad of 1$ bills with you , and put an extra smile on the faces of the people who work so hard for so little in a country that is plagued with such high levels of poverty food : breakfast - excellent with lots of choices lunch - good with some great beach food throughout our stay dinner - very average , but still ok we do not expect all inclusives to be like a high end restaurant in the states neither one of us got sick as others have mentioned from time to time in their reviews i eat everything , but i use common sense if fish/seafood is served on the beach at 12:30, then i do not grab a plate full of mussels , shrimp , and calamari after it 's been in the sun for two hours others did not seem to understand this and will probably be talking about their food poisoning issues in their own review shows : we laughed and said that the shows were the ones rejected by carnival cruiseline back in the 80's the sax player , as mentioned often , is outstanding and we had fun just hanging out and being with all the fun people we met overall resort ( facility ) : it really is like a slice of heaven - the beach - the pool - the botanical gardens with the parrots , peacocks , and flamingos it is amazing ( and we laughed because we took about a case of mosquito spray with us and did not have even one bite us during our whole trip maybe it 's all about the time of year , amount of rain we 'd love to hear from folks who are planning on being at the excellence punta cana next march that 's when we plan to return the biggest complaint i had was that i did not take along enough tide stain remover sticks keep that in mind 
my husband and i just got back from our one week stay at the excellence and enjoyed every minute there after reading a couple of the other reviews we were a bit nervous but once there all our worries went away we 've stayed at other 5 star all inclusives and this one is by far our favorite yeah the ride from the airport is a bit bumpy and long ( but not as bad as expecterd from some of the other write ups ) and yes there were a couple of meals we might not have enjoyed as much as others ( nothing we disliked - more between good and great ) the room was above average , in that the air conditioning would keep the room at the temperature you set ( feedback from folks at the airport on other hotels reported various air conditioning issues ) , and the rooms were spacious , well decorated , and clean there were some tiny ants in one part of the room ( where they put fresh flowers ) , but nothing that was bothersome and we were on the first floor with a hammock outside so it 's not like we did not let any bugs in ourselves really the overall experience was extraordinary our favorite restaurants were the french , mexican  asian if you visit agave make sure to stop in for a margarita in the bar inside this was one of our stop overs every night after we met kenny , a bartender there , who made the best margaritas we never felt like we had to tip extra nor did we feel the service was bad on the contrary , everyone there was very helpful and friendly - warm smiles on their faces we even had a security guard come at 1 am to try to find the critter outside our room that would not stop chirping other tips : banana mama 's were great pool drinks , as were coco locos ( drinks served inside coconuts ) if you 're craving the coconut meat inside the coconut ( which was tasty ) then ask the bartender to crack open the coconut after you 've finished your drink the lobster house was *hot* and if it 's been a hot day i would not recommend eating there also we found the steamed lobster to be much better than the grilled ( we had not tried grilled before that ) also , if it 's a hot day and you plan on eating at agave then the courtyard is cooler than the indoor part of the restaurant as already mentioned our stay was wonderful and would recommend the resort already looking forward to our next stay 
stayed 4 nights last week at the excellence punta cana and the only complaint i have is that i should have booked it for longer i think 5 nights would have been perfect i read many reviews of the resort after booking the trip to celebrate my husband 's 40th birthday as well as our anniversary i was not sure what to expect , since some of the reviews i read were quite poor i can tell you for a fact , that the excellence punta cana could not possibly be better the resort is absolutely beautiful , the beach is gorgeous and isolated everything is well - run , from the restaurants to the bars to the nightly entertainment our favorite restaurants were agave , barcelona , and of the course the breakfast each morning at toscana was wonderful we had the swim - up suite , ocean - view , excellence club level and it was totally worth it we thought we were in paradise yes , the bus ride from the airport is very bumpy pothole - filled , but certainly not the brush with death others would have you believe once you get to the resort , the long , bumpy ride is well worth it do bring one dollar bills for tipping the staff is extremely friendly , everyone is so happy there we did not book any excursions , we did not need too the pool and the beach were so great we were not bored we ca not wait to go back , only next time we 'll book for a longer stay 
a memorable vacation we were a group of 10 people in our mid thirtees who went to get away from jobs and kids in july of 2008 my husband and i went to the dominican republic a few years ago and stayed at a different all inclusive resort i have to say i was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews we are avid travelers and have been all over the united states , europe and the tropics we also grew up in philadelphia near some of the finest restaurants in the world i can honestly say that the only people who can complain about the food are those who think that chili 's is great mexican food i think people who have either been exposed to more authentic and sophisticated food will agree that the quality and variety of food offered at the resort was fantastic our friends who have never tried japanese cuisine or thought they would hate the french restaurant were thrilled with what was served to those people complaining about the roads , please remember you are in a third world country if you want something less rustic , try florida or hawaii you are on the atlantic side of the island not the carribbean so the water will be rough and the undertow is very strong you can walk down to calmer water but there is a lot of coral there we did not particularly care since we are not avid swimmers we did enjoy the bed cabanas on the beach and by the pool they were beautiful and comfortable i woke up early every day so i was always able to reserve the best spot for us i learned on my first morning from some people i met that the trick was grab a towel on a chair that is rolled up then you can use it if you like the chair , just spread out the towel and no one will touch it if you prefer a more peaceful environment then head over to the cascade pool there are tons of towels , less people and the water is slightly more refreshing i will say that i will never go back to a tropical island in the summer while the temperature was only in the mid 80s for a high , it barely dropped at night even the staff was complaining about the heat unfortunately , the pool did not have enough time to cool off at night and did not offer much relief of course the heat is not the fault of the resort there was constant attention from the staff someone was always walking around asking if we wanted a drink even if the bar was only a few steps away we started calling one guy the dominos delivery man because he brought personal sized pizzas to you in the pool so you would not even have to get out of the water unlike many all inclusive resorts the alcohol was not some off brand they offered absolut and stoly along with several other vodkas as an example i happen to love captain morgan rum but discovered barcelo especial which is a dominican rum to be even more flavorful and it made for an increadible mojito i did have 3 legitimate complaints : 1) we were all annoyed by the fact that they allowed outside people to approach us on the beach or by the pool to offer us excursions granted it only happened once or twice a day but i did not want to be disturbed at all 2) there were no bathrooms close to the swim up bar or the beach in order to go you had to get dressed and walk up to the main building that is quite a distance when you 've been laying out or drinking in the sun all day i wonder how many people actually made their way out of the pool every time ( as i mentioned , the cascade bar is much less crowded ) 3) we were a large group and not only are reservations not required but they were not accepted that meant we had to wait approximately an hour to eat together ( unless we ate very early ) or we wound up splitting up and going to different restaurants it would have been nice to spend more time together as a group around the table since we do not get to see each other too often at home however , when it was just the two of us , the wait was minimal even during peak dinner time i wish they would at least allow reservations for larger parties one of the couples that went with us stayed at an excellence property in mexico and they said that resort was even nicer than this one i am very much looking forward to checking that out soon 
excellence was excellente excellence punta cana is by far excellente everything about the resort is beautiful outside of th resort however leaves something to be desired the dominican people live in small huts with garbage everywhere it is for sure a third world country the roads have potholes the size of the vehicles and it takes about an hour and twenty minutes to go from the airport to the hotel once you arrive at the hotel it is just the opposite you arrive to a beautiful open air building with a glass of champagne and damp cloth to greet you check in is very quick and you are off to your room a bellman brings your bags directly there from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are pampered our room was a jr suite swim out swim out is the way to go just feet to the pool the room is pretty nicely decorated and had a 2 person juccuzi the mini bar and coffee was restocked daily and maid service was top notch , there was not a detail overlooked by the maids between each building was beautiful gardens with elegant walk ways as far as the rest of the resort goes you can definately tell that they have put time and thought into every aspect of it the restuarants where excellent we went to the chez isabelle , the grill , the toscana , the barcelona , and the lobster house chez isablle has the best rib steak by far as for the lobster house we were not impressed limited choice of dishes and the lobster was not what we expected aside from that breakfast , lunch , and dinner at any resaurant was perfect the premises of the resort are well maintained and every single worker was extremely friendly the beach was beautiful with carribean color but atlantic waves give you the best of both worlds to the right of the resort there were pools formed from coral and the water was so calm , so clear and just a perfect place to relax everything about our honeymoon was great at the excellence the only bad thing about it was a hard bed and pillows we feel ike they could do better with them also vendors come everyother day and try and sell you the same thing at all of them you are better buying from the giftshop at the hotel vendors harass you until you give in overall 5 star resort but i will not return due to the conditions outside the resort makes for a scarey ride to and from the airport 
my husband and i took our honeymoon to excellence , july 14 - 20th after reading some of the previous reviews , we were a little skeptical of what we would think of the resort and the amenities but after experiencing it for ourselves we have to say it was above and beyond fabulous we are very easy going , easy to please people , but definitely enjoy the finer things in life the resort was gorgeous , the room was perfect , the staff went out of their way to make us happy , the food was good ( not fabulous , but definitely good ) , there was plenty to do if you wanted activities ( we spent all of our time in or by the pool or on the beach ) all in all it truly was a wonderful , relaxing , fun honeymoon and vacation to address some of the negative reviews we read , the ride from the airport is a little bumpy , but it is not that bad there are just roads with potholes , but the drivers do a great job of avoiding them in the hour it takes to drive from the airport to the resort , there was maybe a total of 2 minutes where the road was really bad the bugs - yes , mosquitoes come out , but only at night from our experience , and they are not terrible with a coat of bug spray ( mainly on your ankles and feet ) before going outside for the evening , you are fine we will agree you are not eating at 5 star restaurants there , but there are 8 places to eat and definitely something for everyone 's taste between them our favorites ( in order ) were the chez isabelle ( french ) , agave ( mexican ) , tuscana - for breakfast and lunch , the grill ( lunch and dinner ) we did not try the lobster house or barcelona because we heard so - so reviews for them both we were not able to try spice ( asian ) but heard it was very good also , there is a pizza place , which is fabulous there is a guy that walks around the pool and beach during the day with a blue bag full of individual pizzas we took full advantage of that several days and , the pizza place is open late ( until 2:00 am ) so it is great for the late nights after the disco service - we had nothing but top of the line service the staff was so friendly and quick to accommodate any request we had we did stay at the excellence club ( which i would definitely recommend spending a little more money to upgrade to ) and loved the amenities that came with it robert , one of our private concierge persons at the club , was amazing he knew each club resident by name and just went out of his way to please his guests carlos was also a great staff employee that helped us with our bags he was always wearing a smile and quick to help us with anything we needed the event coordinators were so much fun we loved all of them , but the 2 that stood out to us were alexandra and franklin they were so much fun and did a great job with all the activities if you go to excellence and see the , be sure to tell them that sammy sosa said to tell them hi ( my husband was introducing himself as sammy sosa to everyone that worked there they thought he was too funny , but never forgot his name the shows at night were a little cheesy ( especially the magician ) but all are entertaining to watch the circus show ( which was more like a cirque show ) was fun and the michael jackson show was really great the young michael was amazing the disco ( dance club ) was a lot of fun and never so crowded you could not dance definitely do the dominican cookout on the beach they serve dominican food , set up tables on the beach , have live music with an area to dance it was great fun and neat to try the food i would say that 80% of the guests there were on there honeymoon , but there were several anniversary couples there as well definitely a perfect place for couples bottom line , i would definitely recommend excellence to anyone - especially honeymooners we cannot wait to go back for our 5 year anniversary 
nice vacation , but traveler beware my wife and i just returned from our trip to punta cana where we stayed at the excellence resort this is a couples resort so no children upon arrival on the island , a bus will take you to the resort be prepared for an hour+ ride as this resort is the further distance from the airport the roads near the airport are fine , but they get narrow and bumpy as you get closer to the resort when you check - in at the resort , they may offer you a room upgrade to their 'excellence club ' they promised services that they failed to deliver on such as daily fresh towels for poolside , daily newspaper , and some other services we did receive massages as part of the upgrade and these were very good , but again briefly hassled at the spa the spa is nice although the jets were not working in the spa tub overall i think this upgrade was a ripoff for what one pays for it i suggest you think twice if they offer it to you we experienced that the electricity in the room would go off daily for no apparent reason usually in the late afternoon lasting a few minutes to up to 20 minutes the room ac stopped working and we were without it for one day trying to get it fixed was a hassle we tried room service on our first morning where we called up and order coffee , assortment of fruits , and pastries they said it would take 55 minutes to arrive we waited and waited three calls and close to two hours later , it was finally delivered they call that 'carribean time ' this is totally unacceptable for what was ordered after that we gave up on using room service again there are 8 restuarants the food is plentiful and decent however , you will find the meats are heavily salted as i believe they use alot of salt as a means of preserving the meat in the warm climate in the absence of decent refrigeration along this line , my wife got severe food poisoning on the trip we discovered that she was not alone about 30% of percent of the folks we spoke with said that they also experienced some sort of food related illness this is way too high i suggest you bring stomach meds just a precaution the booze at the bars is fine although i found all mixed tropical drinks are very , very sweet most are premixed and not blended at the time of order many times communications is very difficult especially if you do not speak spanish take this into serious consideration and be prepared for this the evening entertainment is decent if you like to watch mainly dancing and lip sync we most enjoyed the jazz - saxophone music played most nights on the plaza and at the martini bar the main pool is expansive it is nice , clean , and warm be aware that it is only 3-4 feet deep great for cooling off and floating in they have no deep typical swimming pool the beach is nice with plenty of loungers and huts for shade however , if you like to swim or wade in the ocean forget it as the ocean is too rough on all days there were warning flags telling people to stay out of the water other than in one small section there are scheduled program activities daily and you can take excursion trips we took one excursion out to an island that was decent the island is poor and there is really no place to wander or go on your own in summary , we had a nice rr type of vacation we made the best of their service and resort activities however , given the very hit and miss service , difficulty with communication , and the clencher being that my wife got severe food poisoning ( like no other time on any other carribean trip ) , this is not a resort or island destination that we 'd consider returning to 
still dreaming of excellence punta cana my husband and i had an amazing experience at excellence punta cana after three weeks , we are still talking to family and friends about our stay the hotel staff was extremely friendly and truly engaged in making sure we were happy this sentiment extended to activities and services not affiliated with the hotel , such as miguel pumarejo of painted pictures and vip , which handled our horseback riding excursion the meals were first rate and thoroughly enjoyed each day victor doroteo , director of restaurants , and rafael , assistant general manager , ensured my husband and i , and our friends , felt comfortable and were enjoying all the hotel had to offer the rooms were immaculate and inviting , and the grounds were beautifully kept , the perfect setting for a peaceful , yet fun , travel experience 
a very relaxing and beautiful vacation i stayed at excellence punta cana from july 5- july 12 with my boyfriend i was very scared to go considering the plethera of bad reviews i was reading there were bugs , the maid service was bad , the car ride was nauseating , the food made them sick the trip to the resort was not as bad as the hype you could tell the roads were in bad shape , but the ride was not bumpy enough that it 'd make you physically ill or anything the drivers do the best they can to avoid the pot holes we chose to stick with the free transfer as opposed to getting a taxi or private car , and as it turns out , the bus ride was still only an hour and went directly to the resort therefore , i recommend that you do not shell out extra money on unnecessary transportation the resort is beautiful the rooms are spacious and beautiful as well we had no bug problems in the room , although the mosquitos outside are pretty bad we brought bug spray and still got quite a few bites the maid service was great , our room was cleaned daily so we had no issues with that the restaurants are okay - neither good nor bad go early though , because from 8 o 'clock onwards , you 're looking at a good hour wait no matter which restaurant you choose the nightly entertainment was cute i though it was nice because it ran from 10 pm - 10:30 pm and by that time you 're pooped from the sun and just want to head to bed anyway the drinks were delicious i recommend the coco loco in a coconut if you want a bed on the beach just put a book or something on one of them before breakfast to reserve it the shops on site are nice but expensive we ran out of sunscreen and had to pay 18 bucks u stay away from the vendors on site that are wearing green shirts they harass you to buy their stuff it is very annoying all in all , it was a very enjoyable trip i would not go back because there 's so many other places and resorts to see but i definitely do not regret going and sincerely enjoyed my time there i will never forget my 7 day stay at excellence punta cana two more things real quick #1- you will make so many friends while you 're there the other coupls are so friendly #2- the dominicans really appreciate being tipped in ways other than monetary we gave things away like clothing , books , and school supplies if you can fit stuff in your luggage , bring random stuff that you 're not using anymore 
wow the resort was amazing beautifully decorated , very lush and tropical it was exactly what my husband and i expected from a 5 star all inclusive adult only resort there were no armbands necessary , no reservations for restaurants and oh the pool bar its a swim up bar under a canopy of trees that keep the water a few degrees cooler than the rest of the winding pool there were 4 bar tenders on a friday at 12:00 just servicing that area the service was perfect pedro and juan at the beach area were great they would bring us ice cold rum coconuts to our hammocks on the beach , and be back with more before we asked there was always someone around to get what we needed the food at the restaurants was not very good unless your talk to the chef at the grill ricky and the chef valentine will hook you up btw , we showed our gratitude for the service by tipping them as we would here in miami at a bar for some drinks or breakfast/dinner at a restaurant , its only fair you can also stick to the buffet or the burgers and hotdogs by the outdoor bar around 6:30 we also took the inclusive 30min horseback ride on the beach which took more like an hour it was very scenic they may even let you trot on the beach if you ask the handler dont go on the atv ride it was 2hrs through the same dirt road you travelled on , then through a very poor town and twice through a shop trying to sell mamajuana ( wormwood drink ) and atv riding cd 's the ride cost $80 so dont go also keep in mind it takes an hour to get to this resort and half of it is on very badly pot holed - never had asphault streets but it is worth it it is a very romantic , well kept and friendly resort 
the resort was more then i expected staff was friendly and more then willing to help out in anyway ( atleast the excellence club staff ) i recommend taking the sonoa island excursion a long day but easily enjoyable only problems i encountered were getting beach towels and getting cash atm was broken , so make sure you bring enough cash as there is no where else to get cash unless you go to the casino and that is only to get credit to play as for towels , the racks are always empty , but finally on the 4th day i figured out to go to the clubhouse on the beach for more towels the food was excellent not very big portions , but tasted great make sure you watch the shows every evening they are entertaining gym and spa also rated excellent , ( hot jacuzzi then jump in the cold bath overall it was a relaxing week i highly recommend for couples 
2008 trip even better than the 2007 trip save all your money and get to this resort we found the other couples at the resort to be laid - back and easy - going the service is the best the following people on the staff made our second visit even more wonderful than our first visit : elvira gil , luciano romero , rafael puello , berthold dettweitler , gregoria castillo thank you , too , to : hector at the front desk , domingo on the saxophone , the crew at martini , cristian , jenny , jennifer , santa , senter , inez , altagracia ( alta ) , altagracia ( peque?a ) , ramona of the lovely voice , and franklin the entire staff is heavenly , so do not miss the experience of the excellente at punta cana carolina and frank 
great honeymoon my husband and i just came back from excellence punta cana on our honeymoon and it was great the ride from the hotel was not as bad as what we read , but the potholes are very , very big the way the driver has to maneuver around them almost reminded us of a rollercoaster the staff at excellence are very friendly and we found the food to be very tasty toscana is good for breakfast and great for lunch because of the variety we ate dinner at agave and the grill which are very good at the grill look for lopez , who is a very personable guy with a great sense of humor looking for souvenirs walk down the beach next to building 14 in the excellence club , just over the fence are small shops that have great items at low prices that you can negoitiate go to nancy 's because she is the best she will not hassle you at all and she has everything even nice linen suits for guys who forgot to bring long pants for the dinner dress code the views are spectecular , the staff is warm , and the drinks are flowing 
excellent place for a laid back vacation stayed at excellence punta cana from july 3- july 9 resort is very well maintained we stayed in building 9 on the3rd floor room was very nice and clean we did have a few issues with small ants in our room the 3rd floor rooms seem bigger becouse the ceilings are vaulted , making it seem nicer the mini - bar was restocked daily and you can request what you would like in it maid service was very good in our building and done everyday the food at most of the resturants was good , however if you traveled with a group of people as we did ( 6 of us ) you need to go to dinner early as they dont have many tables for 4-6 people most are set for 2 persons the french resturant was our favorite and we also enjoyed spice and barcelona breakfast and lunch were also good the beach is great if your a beach person , however the waves are very rough , but fun to play in if your a good swimmer the resort staff does a geat job trying to keep quest entertainedon the beach and at the pools as well as at night did not seeany shows , so i ca not comment on them , we enjoyed sitting at the bars and talking with the bartenders kafe cafe was were we spend most of our time benjiman , pablo , pedro and marino were our favorte bartenders the were fun to talk to and would try to answer any questions we had overall this is a great place if you just want to relax and enjoy the beach and pools service was excellent at the beach and watching them cook something different everyday on the beach was also fun and last but not least , the ride to and from the airport is long and rough the drivers do the best they can to make it comfortable , but if you get motion sickness easily i suggest you take something with you to calm you stomach had a great time 
best experience ever , so far i read the negative reviews and wonder if i stayed at the same resort , we stayed a week and had one waiter that was not up to standard , outside of that we had not one bad experience there were always good food choices and the servers were great i am an american so good food and resturants are plenty so i do not go to these resorts for the food however the food here is as good as i have eaten in any resort in the caribbean , mexico to jamaica the room was always clean and the excellenc club was a well worth it upgrade , the food there was a nice mid morning or afternoon snack the bus ride from the hotel was not great but a good time to see the country and the coulture of the people all the rides we took were an experience in itself i have been to several resorts and can assure you that if you have even half the time we did you will not regret the time spent at this resort or this country the romantic atmosphere is fantastic and being able to see just couples and not kids running around added to the overall oppertunity to have a romantic experience and a great week any review i read with negatives is just not a picture of our week or experience i would love to return and have exacatly the same experience i had the first time i would love to warn you about something but the only thing i can say is , go to this place and set your standards as high as you like and you will not be disappointed if a wait for a resturant or a towel not being in a certain place or some food not being available or a rough ride from the airport is not the end of the world for you then you can expect and will not be disappointed in your stay and a 5 star , first class place 
excellence punta cana vs excellence cancun my husband and i just returned from a week vacation at excellence punta cana ( june 29- july 6) we visited excellence cancun in nov 2006 and were absolutely stunned in every way by that resort so for our next holiday we could not wait to go to another excellence resort unfortunately the two simply do not compare our holiday all in all was fantastic - no resort is perfect and your vacation will always be what you make it that said - there are several factors about excellence punta cana that deserve mentioning if you are planning a vacation to an excellence resort think mexico instead there are never any towels first thing in the morning towels are laid out on beach chairs ( appearing that the chairs are already reserved ) eventually it was realized that these are in fact the only towels which will be put out yes there are towel stands all about the pool areas but not on one occassion were there ever any new towels put out we resorted to carrying our towels back up to our room as we went without for 2 days and when we finally got some we were not going to let them go 2- the food is very good at every restaurant we were excited to learn that the same restaurants were offered as in cancun ( spice ( japanese ) is an absolute must the complaint we have with the food is that staff would simply substitute whatever they felt like on your dish on more than a few occassions we did not receive the dish we ordered as desribed in the menu from time to time ( before ordering ) we were advised that they were out of certain ingredients ( mushrooms , gaucemole ) ok we can deal with that but then we would be served a dish which had maybe one ingredient out of the actual description with no further explanation ( even though there was no mention of a shortage of the items in said dish ) everything still tasted wonderful - but we found this to be frustrating as you really never knew if you were going to get what you ordered 3 - the beach is absolutely magnificent there are definitely sand bugs - but they are selective biters ( my husband had lots of bites all over and i have none ) the beach at excellence cancun does not compare to punta cana in any way if a gorgeous beach is your #1 priority then the other short comings this resort has will be totally insignificant the beach at punta cana is truly breathtaking 4- the service is really hit and miss there were some truly terrible waiters and then some wonderful ones the terrible ones seemed to keep finding us , although we did have our share of excellent service also no one is in any kind of a hurry to do anything for you , and we were expecting the service we received at cancun which we definitely did not we always tipped and clearly this is expected no matter what people may say unfortunately it really does not do anything to improve the level of service there were considerable wait times for dinner in speaking with other patrons we learned that sometimes you were given a beeper and they just never beeped you you can wait until 10:30and learn the restaurant has since closed then you are stuck ordering room service from a very miserable attendant and that takes at least an hour ++ we were advised they only have one employee to handle room service ( ca not believe that to be true but that is what we were told ) 6- the drinks strictly comparitively speaking - a strawberry dauquiri or a pina colada offered at excellence punta cana is at least half the size of what is offered in mexico yes , it is an all inclusive and you can get as many as you want but there is just such a difference excellence punta cana serves up a slushy mixture in a little cup just like any other 4* resort we have been excellence cancun blends the ice , alcohol and fruit ( like a smoothie ) it is just so different and was very disappointing : ( the resort is truly beautiful and well maintained we were disappointed as we had expectations from our past experience which were just not met at this resort we plan to try out excellence in jamaica next year when it opens - or go back to cancun spend the extra few bucks and go to mexico 
fit for a king  excellente ' that is what you hear throughout the day my new husband  i returned yesterday (7/9/08) from a incredible week of relaxation  luxury we say luxury because every day numerous employees asked how we were doing , can i get you a drink , do you need anything , and more i believe what made this vacation so impressive were the resorts employees they were all so very wonderful and happy to serve you for example , we sat by the pool every day and throughout the day you would be asked what would you like to drink when the waiter returned i would thank him and his response was it is our pleasure they served top shelf alcohol the biggest decision we had was what am i going to drink today ( which i recommend always trying the drink of the day ) and what time are we going to eat the food was good some meals we enjoyed more than others we especially liked barcelona , spice , and agave breakfast  lunch was always a buffet in toscana and the selection of food was vast , however you could also order breakfast and lunch a la carte ' at one other restaurant we stayed in an oceanview room on the 3rd floor and were able to overlook the pool  see out to the ocean ( what an amazing view ) the air conditioning in the room was very comfortable the rooms were super clean , big , and they offered plenty of drawers  closet space we had a large lcd tv along with a dvd player that we watched movies on the grounds are immaculate all the grass is green , beautiful flowers everywhere , flamingos , parrots , peacocks , the pool super clean it 's like fantasy island at this resort we did upgrade to an excellence club room where we enjoyed all the priviledges of the club membership everyday club members were given a buffet for breakfast , lunch  dinner we would have a small plate between meals we totally enjoyed the club and it was nice having free internet access it was really nice not having to to carry money or a purse the service was so good that all i wanted to do was tip , tip , tip and the best part was that they were so grateful we happened to be at the resort on the fourth of july they pulled out all of the stops at about mid day they began setting up the beach in the evening wen we returned to the beach we were amazed to see the ocean front transformed to an independence day celebration several grills and bars were set up rock and roll was playing and there was even uncle sam walking on stilts the even concluding with a firework celebration all while the american flag flew high on the dominican beach we just do not have enough good things to say about this resort and we ca not wait to go back on our last day we met a couple who was returning for their fourth time i 'm by no means am i a queen , but they really made me feel like royalty 
a great vacation we loved excellence the grounds are beautiful and well maintained the beach is clean - waves are fun and if you take a small walk you can find a spot where there are no waves the food was great - our favorite was the french the entertainment team of alexandra , joanna , ines , franklin and altragrasia and juan made our vacation extra special they always were having fun on the beach or at the pool our room was clean and the refrigerator was kept well stocked the bartenders were great and when on the beach made sure you had a drink do not miss the dominican night on the beach - even if you just stop by and see the fruit carvings and listen to the band - with the ocean in the background and the full moon we had it was a beautiful 
excellent in most ways my husband and i recently stayed at the epc from june 26 until july 2 i 've been reading reviews of the resort for over and month and could not wait to go in most ways , the resort was everything the reviews have claimed it to be the beach was amazing - with shaded chairs and beds easily available we sat on the beach for hours , played in the waves , and walked the shore line everyday there are only a couple of shops on each side of the resort and after the first day , the locals never bothered us again i cannot say enought about how wonderful the beach was of course , the frequent drinks and delivered pizzas made the beach even better usually around 3:30 we would head over to the pools finding a raft was never difficult - although finding a chair in the shade was a bit more challenging truthfully , we only went to the pool to cool off and enjoy drinks from the swim up bar - and by 3:30 the bar was pretty well shaded anyway i thought that our room was above average that was our second room at least the 1st room we were assigned was in building 14 it smelled moldy , and the air conditioning did not work we immediately asked to move and found our 2nd room to be much better we stayed in building 6 which was much closer to the action it took a little while for the room to cool off - but after 24 hours it stayed rather chilly the room was spacious and the bed gigantic i am not sure what size the beds are , but we have a king sized at home and it was much larger than that i would say that my only disappointment with epc was the food perhaps i read too many awesome reviews of the restaurants and had too high of expectations the food was not bad - just not excellent ( excpet for at agave - there the food was the best - although it was very hot in the dining room i will warn you that almost all of the meat entrees are covered in gravy even at the grill - where steak is their specialty many times we received a variation of what we ordered off the menu we got many laughs out of trying to imagine how our entree might be different that it 's discription the funniest was when i ordered apple pie with vanilla ice cream i said to my husband if i only get vanilla icecream , i will be happy he about died of laughter when i received my apple pie topped with orange sherbert but like i said , the food was not bad - just not excellent and you would probably like it even better if you are a fan of surprises on a positive note , i highly recommend eating the lunches that are prepared on the beach we ate the bbq and the beef fajitas and they were awesome some of the best food we ate of the entire trip overall , we felt the epc was a great value for the $ we stayed in their most basic room and enjoyed every minute of our trip i say remember to have a sense of humor and do not forget the sunscreen 
average , at best my husband and i just returned from a week long stay for our honeymoon needless to say that we were looking forward to this vacation after a year of wedding planning the resort is average , so if you go there with high expectations , lower them the trip from the airport is like a ride at six flags , without the safety harnesses it takes about an hour and a half to get to the resort , that 's if you do not have to make any stops at the other resorts we used vip transfer services i do recommend them because i talked to other visitors who used private taxis or other transfer services who were not reliable at all and were stranded at the airport the island itself is not somewhere you would ever visit if you 're not staying at one of the resorts what a dump the resort itself is absolutely beautiful the glass of champagne was much needed after that trip from hell from the airport we had the honeymoon package and never recieved our banner for the door or rose petals on the bed never had a bath drawn for us like they advertise our romantic dinner was a nice touch , though our favorite restaurants were spice and the grill everything else was mediocre , at best do not go to th lobster house for breakfast - horribly bland food and terrible service my husband on multiple occassions in different restaurants had to go get our water for us the waiter at the lobster house for dinner was exceptional my husband had to leave the table for a moment before our food was brought out and the waiter saw this , so he kept his food warm for him the nightly shows were cheesy the michael jackson show was great , however we stayed at the pool bar all week long and met some great people who we will keep in touch with this is where the partyers go , so if you like a quieter scene , stay at the cascade pool stay away from the fruity drinks as much as possible my husband and i both ended up with e coli and we attribute it to the fruits and possibly the ice they say they use purified water for everything , but i think they most likely let some things slide my husband is latin and loives his flan one day at the toscana lunch buffett he asked to take some flan to go and they would not let him , only pizza he spoke with concierge and they were of no help they told him to call room service and have it delivered when he did , they do not offer it the service is very up and down it 's either exceptional , or very poor and forget eating luch by the pool , there is no service there for food except for the occasional waiter carrying around soggy nachos and , you have to be 100% dry to eat lunch in one of the two restaurants offering lunch breakfast at toscana is not very good , either the martini bar was fun make sure to ask for marino if you like dirty 's he makes a mean dirty martini try a coco loco , but only one and , do not order off any of the drink menus you 'll get extremely week , way too fruity drinks stick with what you normally drink trust me , you 'll get a much better drink yellow beach towels are like gold there if you find some , it 's like hitting the lottery only one day during our 7 day stay were we able to find towels and , we got the last two at the club house the seas were very rough , so head down the beach to the right a ways and the waters are much calmer no more near hospital stays for us we were so sick , my husband had to have antibiotics once we returned to the states we had to buy pepto and pedialight at the drugstore for $24 during two separate occasions , my hubby had issues with the female hotel staff being in the restrooms once was in the lobby bathroom there was a woman folding towels in the men 's restroom he asked her to please leave and she refused i know there was not a lack of comunication because he speaks fluent spansh he left and went to our room to use the restroom the housekeeper saw him walk into our room , even said hola to her he walked back out of the restroom and she was in there making our bed no knock or anything and , having him speak spanish was great , because the staff speaks very little english the entertainment staff really tries to get everybody involved and they have so much energy we 're not into all the little activities , but if you are , there 's plenty to do so , to narrow it down : the major pro is the beauty of the resort major con : well , too many to name 
average , not excellence , with poor food my wife and i went to excellence punta cana june 14th - june 22nd to give everyone some brief background i have been to many caribbean islands and all - inclusive resorts including sandals ( st lucia , whitehouse in jamaica , ocho rios ) , aventura spa palace , and cayman islands i will breakdown the negatives and positives below , but my overall impression and time at excellence was just average/ok , with the food ok to poor , with the only positive being the beauty of the resort and the beach i will try keep it simple , as other reviews pretty much give all the detailspositives : 1 landscaping - beautiful with gorgeous views and palm trees everywhere great garden trail with flamingos , peacocks , chickens , birds , native plants , geese , and talking parrots but the thing is all the resorts i have been to have beautiful landscaping so it was no different then any other resort , and some other resorts have had even more impressive lobbies and landscaping beach : probably one of the best beaches i have been to very large , and long beach which you could take a 2 mile walk either way , and clear blue water yes , the water can be rough at times , with a strong undertoe , but it 's not too much worse than that seen on the east coast of the usa in the atlantic ocean if you walk 500 yards or so down to the right you will find very calmer water it is a really scenic walk my wife and i had a fun time jumping and surfing the waves only downfall was there is no beautiful sunsets as the sun sets on the other side of the island really ca not do too many motorized sports on the water due to the rough water , but some people took out kayaks the lifeguards are out watching everyone , with restricted areas to swim due to rough water the time we were there was red flagged ( meaning take your own risks while swimming ) , but it really was not all that bad , just be cautious and do not swim out far , and try to swim with a buddy if not such a great swimmer the beach has a great breeze which takes off the heat and feels good , watch for sunburn though pools : beautiful they have 2 pools the main pool which pretty much winds thru the most of the resort , and a 2nd smaller cascade/waterfall pool , which is more quiet and relaxing the main pool has many huts which you can lay on a bed or chairs , and to keep out of the sun if you get too burned make sure to wear lots of sunscreen the first few days as you can get burned easily try to reserve the huts early before breakfast as many guests reserve them early , grab a towel or book and place them on your chair or bed each day they always have activities including volleyball , aerobics , spanish lessons , dance classes , horse back riding , and other fun games with the entertainment crew check out the daily entertainment board and/or the excellence newsletter which the maids should drop of each evening in your room for turn down service staff : very friendly the staff always appreciated a dollar here and there for a good job the entertainment crew does a great job to keep people entertained the bartenders and pool service staff were great as well , they were always coming around with drinks and fresh baked pizza?? domingo the sax player was great and i enjoyed listening to him play before and after dinner gym : this was nice looks like they just renovated the gym also nice hidden hut near gym and tennis courts that had a bar and pool tables , ping pong , foose ball , darts , archery , and so on fun to play before dinner drinks : were great , you really can?? mess up alcoholic drinks to bad try the cocoloca bring bug spray with deet , but never had any real problems with mosquitoes food : next to relaxing and hanging by the pool and beach , food is probably one of the most important aspects of a vacation to me excellence states that they have 5 star food , well this is not true and it really made me mad that excellence mis - represents their menu i am not kidding , many menu items are not served as described , and i don?? believe this is a server error , it is just that the resort created a menu to look good , but doesn?? always give you what you ordered , plus the quality of most of the food was poor to terrible examples i ordered an italian canoli and got a chocolate bar filled with pudding , and every time i ordered an argula or spinach salad they gave me romaine lettuce , and the little english the server could talk said ??es this is spinach , and that was the only lettuce they had here? obviously it was not spinach , the resort mis - represented a lot of their food from what their menu?? state my wife ordered crab stuffed shrimp ( but no crab ) , many dishes were missing specific recipes such as bacon , cheeses , veggies the staff were polite , but they really need better english speaking skills since they are serving to mostly english speaking guests in an americanized resort i appreciate their language and i was motivated to learn spanish and used it a lot while on the resort , but their was a huge language barrier at dinner service with most staff only speaking very little english and others speaking no english and looked clueless when you ordered your food i ordered chicken pad thai and got shrimp pad thai , told the server i was allergic to shrimp and he smiled and walked away and did not come back b/c he had no idea what i said had to track down the manager to change my order dinner service most nights were a mess the fact that many of the dinner dishes were incorrect and the staff waiters knew little english made dinner a diseaster if something was wrong with your dish , b/c there was no way to explain this to your server , they didn?? have a clue what you were saying the fish was absolutely terrible , you would think it?? be great on an island , well not so the only ok food was the grill ( just the steaks ) , beach bbq?? were good , and the pizza?? were great there was no restaurant that stood out to me b/c it was hit or miss , and when it was a hit , it was just average you would think with an executive chef from germany it would be a little better the buffets were bad , and always gave me an upset stomach and many guests i talked to also agreed the food was average and many had upset stomachs my wife got really bad stomach pains and probably had some sort of food poisoning the coffee was not good either and every morning we asked for a cappucino the machine was broken and could not get one the only ok buffet food was the fresh omelette and pasta stations , or any station that cooked freshly made chicken or steaks the pizza?? were probably the best food there the chaffing dishes/food on the buffet were soggy , and did not look fresh the resort would have buffet dinners on some nights , but it usually was leftover food from the lunch service i would just stick with freshly cooked meat if you are a food person i would avoid this resort they need major improvement in the quality of their food and they need to represent their menu?? and serve you what is stated the food at other all - inclusives i have been to has 10x better food room service : arrived within a decent time , but food was soggy and cold arrival : ride from the airport to the resort was very very bumpy , with poor roadways in much need of repair i tolerated this ok as i do not get motion sickness , but my wife felt ill after the ride the ride was about 1 1/2 hours rooms : the rooms were average at best i??e seen much better rooms at other resorts with much better maintained the jacuzzi drain did not work correctly , constantly draining the water , the toilet leaked and did not always flush , and the shower constantly leaked water the caulking around the shower walls were terrible and needed maintenance the furniture was just ok , and looked old and needed updating the mini - bar was nice , always kept full with beer , water , sodas the maid service was hit or miss , some days it was done on time , other days it was forgotten the beds were hard , and my wife and i had some back pain the first couple of days , but we tolerated it the rest of the week , but the bed could??e been much better maids need to leave more wash/face towels , they were rarely replaced room has safe which was nice to keep valuable , but this is nothing special and can be found at any resort 
could not complain my husband and i celebrated our sixth anniversary at the excellence , ( we 've stayed at all - inclusive resorts in many carribean islands in the past ) and we enjoyed every aspect of this resort i will address the issues that were reviewed negatively that worried me the taxi ride was long , a little over an hour , but well worth the wait the majority of the roads did have potholes , but all drivers we had ( three different companies ) were very careful drivers the ocean was very rough and had warning flags posted most of the time , but a short five minute walk down the shore line was calmer waters where you could snorkel easily the pool was superb , winding throughout the resort , with several bars ( including a swim up bar ) and bathroom huts located conveniently there were a plentitude of chairs and covered cabanas to lay on , and we never had trouble getting towels or rafts to float on the help was more than accomodating , friendly , and easy to find the restaurants did not require reservations , but provided buzzers that you could take all over the resort we tried all spots except the agave , because we ran out of time , and enjoyed all the restaurants we found that wtih each spot , there were some courses we were not crazy about , but then most were absolutely wonderful at breakfast and lunch you could choose between buffet and an al a carte restaurant my husband and i usually do not love buffets , but these were impressive huge selections of a good variety , breakfast with omelet , pancake , and smootie stations made to order , bloody mary/mimosa stations , breads galore , and over eight juices incl fresh squeezed oj lunch buffet inlcuded pasta stations and pizza made to order and more than we could ever sample at dinner , we were given our own bottle of wine nightly , and had great service at all choices bear in mind that two restaurants nightly are closed , so plan ahead if you want to sample all the spots - the lobster house actually only serves lobster but it was delicious we were unable to upgrade our room b/c of availabiltiy , and had a basic garden suite we were very pleased with the room , which was spacious with a comfortable bed , large jacuzzi tub , full minibar , which was stocked daily , and our room was cleaned in the morning usually before we returned from breakfast nightly there was turndown service , and a daily agenda provided for the following day which were average , but still impressive for a resort the nightclub is not huge but we still had a great time although the theme nights got a little cheesy for our tastes the horseback riding was a treat , and the drinks were all tasty we drank the water served in the restaurants , drank sodas with ice and frozen drinks , and never even felt queasy overall , outstanding experience on all accounts , we will return the only drawback , for those people who like to be active on vacation , was that the excursions were pricey , and all seemed to take a long taxi ride to get there we did the snorkeling trip where you interact with the sting rays and see sharks , which we enjoyed , excluding the hour taxi ride other worthy mentions the aqua therapy included with the massage was a neat experience , and the gym was high end compared to most i 've used the botanical gardens even had flamingos and tame parrrots flitting about this place was full of surprises - you will enjoy it 
excellente - one of the best adults place to stay in punta cana , dr we travel twice a year to different caribean islands we had stayed 5 years ago at iberostar suite in punta cana but was somewhat disappointed with the food and alcohol we are frequent travelers and we enjoy great tasting food , liquor , service , and quality - even if we pay a little bit more to get it even when we are not traveling we like to try new restaurants and enjoy great drinks and quality of service excellence was recommended to me by my co - workers who go back every year for 5 years and have never been disappointed the transportation from the airport was there on time and we did not have to wait for them to fill up an entire bus which i hate my husband and i were the only ones is a private car the trip from the airport to the resort was bumpy but had nothing to do with the resort transportation we booked the excellence club level package with its own concierge and club lounge where different food presentations are laid out each day and internet service was offered the club manage roberto puello was very attentive and patient with our needs and came through with anything we needed worth the extra money for the excellence club level but you can enjoy this resort without a club level since the food , liquor , staff , and other amenities are consistently offered to everyone we arrived at the hotel and was greated with champagne upon arrival and was excorted to the excellence club for checkin with no waiting on lines we asked for coconut with rum and within minutes we were drinking from a coconut wow - service was awesome our room was amazing with a jacuzzi that was part of the room and we had our own private hammock outside with a pool to pretty much jump into from the room the beds had a sheer canapies on the post drapped across the bed bar was fully stocked with anything you want to drink the hotel grounds are incredibly clean and well kept we loved the flamingos and birds close to the spa the gym was well equipped with all types of equipment the pool areas are always not crowded and everyone can have their own space and the water is amazingly blue and always clean the cabanas around the pool are to die for and we just relaxed for hours on them and their is always one available with no need to save space for later the spa is out of this world and we even had massages on the beach that was great/ restaurants are great especially the french one and it is awesome since no reservations are needed and we never waited more than 10 minutes for anyone of them we loved the restaurants for dinner and enjoyed the breakfast and lunch in the buffet loved the champagne with caviar in the morning the food at this resort ranged from lobster to shrimp to lamb chops to the best steaks the food is always presented with quality and care and has an amazing taste to anything we ate great variety , great service and never crowded entertainment staff was awesome and managed to entertain us for 5 days non - stop our favorites staff members were franklin and alta garcia they help you to participate in the entertainment and constantly make us laugh amazing group of entertainers the bar staff at the pool/beach bar - jose , alta garcia ( bar waitress ) , darling and pedro who s at the bar are so attentive and they are so friendly and make awesome drinks with international premium liquors not just dr brands ( hennesyy , johnny walker , absolut ) we loved the fresh coconut drinks with rum inside try that - if you are a drinker - you will love them the staff makes it easy to want to relax and drink - awesome staffoverall i would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in the excellence hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service , quality in food , and staff boy , they mean it , when they called this resort excellence ca not wait to return we think we have found the perfect place to go back to each year especially when we are not traveling with the children since this is the utimate couples/adults resort out there 
amazing service and resort just returned jun 28th , high end all the way if you??e looking for an amazing honeymoon this is your place beautiful beach , tones of activities , great food without the hassle of reservations and 24hr room service if you want breakfast in bed everyday not a problem , amazing pizza brought to any location around the resort and every premium liquor you can think of the resort is very lush with many gardens and wildlife and you might also get wiseld at by spanish speaking parrots i 'd definitely go back and rate this place 5 1/2** 
beautiful and fun excellence was very nice my husband and i had a wonderful honeymoon we met tons of honeymooners the resort was beautiful we loved our room everything was clean and well maintained the beaches had soft , fine sand and crystal - clear water there was always something fun to do if you wanted too : ) the only major drawback was that we both got stomach aches toward the end of our trip and for a while when we got home we did not drink unbottled water so we 're guessing it may have been something with the food/sanitation it was slightly unpleasant but did not keep us from doing things also , if you are a real foodie this may not be the place for you some of the food ( like fruit , seafood , mexican ) was very good but other foods ( asian , meat ) were not very good overall , a wonderful place where you feel very spoiled : ) 
all in your perspective we just returned from a week at excellence and overall we had a relaxing vacation and no regrets on the choice of hotel first off , yes the trip from the airport to the hotel is a long , bumpy ride it does not matter who drives you , the roads will still be bumpy and the hotel will not be any closer to the airport it 's really not a big deal you 'll see some interesting sights along the way it was clean , the staff was very friendly and helpful , and we had no complaints about our room everything worked fine in our room , our mini bar was stocked every day and they had a little snack basket with cookies and crackers that was kept stocked too there was lots of bottle water provided in the room too which was nice the room was cleaned very well and they also have a turn down service which was nice too , they came in cleaned up a bit , turned the bed down and brought us the newsletter for the next day the food was great - absolutely no complaints about the food there is 24 hour room service and the menu has a nice variety we took advantage of the service a few times and the food was always tastey and hot the restaurants were nice , the breakfast and lunch buffet was really good lots of variety the dinner restaurants were also very tastey and it was nice to not worry about reservations the only restaurant that we did not care for ( for dinner ) was the grill , simply because it was kind of dark in there and we like to see what we 're eating small detail though a couple lunches were spent on the beach where they have a beach grill the beach was where we spent most of our time , lots of lounges and hammocks available there are a few beds on the beach too the waves are high which made for some fun swimming and wave boarding there was always someone walking around taking and delivering drink orders on the beach also it was common to see pizza being delivered in the afternoon at the beach there are lots of activites going on for those that wish to participate one really nice feature was the horseback riding we also enjoyed the excellence newsletter that provided a list of the daily activites , timings and locations it also gave the weather forecast , and other tidbits of info like the drink of the day , nightly entertainment , etc the evening shows were okay , entertaining some were a little cheesy but others made up for it and again sometimes it 's what you make of the experience overall we had a nice vacation , we felt a little spoiled while we were there and had a good time there was lot of people there but it never seemed crowded the service was great , if you plan to go to this resort you have nothing to worry about 
could not ask for more the hotel is an all inclusive resort for adults only and we were really surprised at the tranquility of the resort we had a lovely garden view with a balcony , which we sat on every night there were seven restaurants and each one was a different theme ( country ) the food was unlimited and the bars were also all inclusive there was a show every night and different musical groups throughout the resort the beach was breathtaking and we were never disturbed except to ask if we needed any kind of refreshments there were plenty of things to do whether it was water or land based what a vacation we highly recommend this to anyone 
bring plenty of starbuck 's coffee with you excellence in punta cana is a beautiful resort the open lobby is impressive and beautiful the vast majority of the guests were couples , not a place for single people lots of newlyweds and most of the guests were in their 20's and 30's almost all of the guests were american the beach is very pretty , with rows of palm trees on each side there is a great breeze all day long , so you can sit for long periods without feeling the heat the water is rough with great waves for boogey boarding , but the undertow was very strong , so you need to be careful there is a nice lunch cooked on the beach each day , so you do not have to go to a restaurant the pool is nice as well , with the pool bar being the center of activity there are lots of lounges , hammocks and poolside beds the rooms were very nice with large jacuzzis and a four poster bed the help was very accommodating unfortunately , many of them did not speak or even understand english , so you need to bring your spanish - english dictionary they have multiple restaurants and the food was similar to cruise food , not great , but good the french restaurant , chez isabelle , was the best we ate at the spanish ( barcelona ) , the asian ( spice ) , and the steak ( grille ) restaurants all of them were good there was no need for a reservation and the waits were short the service was excellent , as they try to provide for your every need like a cruise , the help is required to say 'olla and buenos dias/nochos ' and smile on the down side : tthere is no real coffee they only served instant coffee i went through withdrawals for a good cup of coffee the daily shows in the evening are amateurish , with lip - syncing dancers in the early part of the week while 24 hour room service is provided , you need to order your food hours before you really want to eat it the rooms smelled musty and the ac was average at best the trip from the airport , which is a hut by the way , was horrible and the worst part of the trip we got transportation to the hotel from orbitz , thinking it would provide us the best chance at a quakity trip to the hotel , not we got on a bus with about 20 other people , we stopped at 10 different hotels the roads , many of which were unpaved or paqed , but full of hundreds of potholes of all sizes each time we stopped , i thougt our luggage would be stolen from the trailer behond the bus it took us the better part of 2 hours to finally get to the resort after 5:00pm , which basically ruined our first day the island is disgraceful outside the resorts and many of them are protected by barbed wire another interesting fact is that there is a $10/person tourist fee to enter the dominican republicoverall , i would go back to excellence , but not in the dominican republic 
excellent excellence was a great place for our honeymoon the restaurants were all delicious and a nice bonus was that people were bringing pizzas to your beach chair at lunch time i 'm not sure why anyone would complain about this resort all employees are exceptionally friendly and helpful and the rooms are great beach is beautiful and if you are afraid of the waves , then just walk to the right of the resort where the water is very calm i would recommend this resort to anyone 
awesome pools , horrible food - excellence punta cana the good :  great drinks ( the banana - mama and dirty monkeys were a hit ) , amazing pools and beaches , terrific atmosphere ( not crowded , zero kids , and an undeniably beautiful resort ) , and amazing rooms definitely a romantic place the endless supply of good room coffee and oreos was a plus also , though we would not mention it if the food was not as bad as it was the bad :  the food was extremely disappointing , with all 8 restaurants being mediocre at best with agave ( the mexican themed restaurant ) being the worst followed closely by spice ( pan - asian ) here are some of the things that comes to mind : undercooked risotto rice , under - cooked chicken , ketchup with noodles that was labeled as spaghetti , runny bland eggs , and an especially offending arugula gorgonzola cheese salad that was seriously spoiled there were many others and basically , we were extremely disappointed with the food room service takes an average of an hour and a half ( to their credit they do mention a long wait ) they have a forgettable evening entertainment program and extremely pushy resort sponsored souvenir vendors ( beware the vendors in the light green shirts - once they get those trinkets on you , it 's going to be very hard to get away from them they are seriously aiming to rip you off , and you can talk them down to a fourth of their original asking price ) there was always a shortage of yellow beach/pool towels so hold on to them the ride to and from the airport is truly an experience with giant potholes and litany of near accidents and is not for the faint of heart overall , we had a great time but will not return if you aim for a romantic experience , this is a place for you previous resorts we have been to are various riu locations , moon palace , and various cruises 
a bit disappointed having just returned home from honeymoon at the excellence punta cana , i have to say i was a bit disappointed i 'd read so many good reviews about the place , i 'm not sure if perhaps their standards are slipping the main areas of the hotel are stunning and the rooms are okay , but not as fantastic as they look on the website we had ants all over ours we asked them to get rid of them but in the end resorted to spraying our own room with bug repellent although the staff were very helpful and friendly during the first week , that definitely tailed off in our second week , glasses of wine at dinner took so long to arrive that we 'd already finished eating we thought the asian and french restaurants were the best , some of the italian was okay but left a lot to be desired drinks were good although make sure you ask for things which are not on the cocktail menu because you 'll get something much nicer the pools are large and clean , as is the beach and it 's not too hard to find a sun lounger the sea is relatively rough so do not expect the stereotyped calm carribean waters and there did not seem to be as many water sports on as is advertised on the website although the horse riding was very pleasant some of the guests were exceedingly ill , which appears to have been more common than we realised having just read another review for the same week as us although we were not very ill we definitely had dodgy stomachs and still have not recovered completely nearly a week on , and the bugs are evil all in all , it was ok but not as good as we had hoped the only major benefit is that it 's child free 
go to relax my wife and i just got back from five days and four nights at the excellence punta cana the place is every bit as beautiful as advertised we found our room to be better than expected we booked a garden view room but this one overlooked the garden and the beach the room was plenty large and we enjoyed the jaccuzi tub ( note* be careful the jacuzzi tubs are not fire proof as some of our friends found out however , if you do burn your jaccuzi they will cheerfully move you to another room at any hour of the night the beach is incredible and there are plenty of towels , lounge chairs , hammocks and beach beds to use we had no trouble finding shade on the beach the beach is definitely the coolest place to be with a continuous breeze there to keep the heat from wearing you down there are plenty of places to get drinks and wait staff working the beach bringing whatever your heart desires some guests found the ocean too rough but i enjoyed using the boogie boards and body surfing the waves a very short walk down the beach leads to a calm area protected by a reef a hundred yards or so off shore this is a nice spot to relax in the ocean with a loved one if the sand and surf is too much for you the pool is to die for it run nearly the entire length of the property , under bridges and around restaurants lots of floats and chairs here too we did not have a bad meal the entire time we were there it is definitely above average for resort food we ate at the french , asian , mexican and italian restaurants my wife enjoyed all of them and she is very hard to please i 've never been to another all inclusive that had better food or service room service may take a while to get there , but it 's a big place , nothing to complain about they are grilling something different on the beach every day at lunch time and that keeps you from having to go change for lunch i like the fact that men are required to wear long pants and a collared shirt to dinner it keeps the place much classier excellence definitely attracts a better class of clientel we only saw one person the entire time who was over served i recommend taking advantage of the spa treatments ( if you can afford to come here you can afford a massage i do not see much need in going on excursions off site unless you 're staying for a couple of weeks and are getting restless that 's just my opinion some people love that kind of stuff i was there to lay on the beach and drink a few coctails and win a few dollars at the blackjack table the travel off site is usually in the back of open air safari trucks the way the roads are inn this country travel time will usually be double what you are quoted the heat and humidity can be oppressive if you are not getting a breeze we did the galloping horseback ride and loved it it was just the two of us and a guide he took pictures and video for us galloping along a deserted beach through the surf is something to do at least once in your life the staff was always friendly and the language barrier was not a problem the bartenders will fix whatever you want and tend to remember you after a couple of visits the casino is small but fun they have five dollar tables for blackjack , roulette and caribbean poker plus slots we booked private travel to and from the resort for the same price as the larger tour bus and the trip only took 60 to 70 minutes each way no stops at any other resorts yes , the roads suck but they 're building a new one parallel to the current wagon trail it should be ready in about fifteen years or so judging by the amount of work we saw some reviewers complained about mosquitos and bugs in their rooms we never had a bug bite and never used the off once we also did not see a bug in our room the entire time all in all it was a great , relaxing vacation we like to try different places when we travel but are considering returning 
excellence by name , excellence by nature just back after 14 nights at the excellence yes , the roads are hazardous being riddled with potholes , but i looked upon it as 'different ' and fun transferring from the airport there is clear evidence that work is underway in building new highways , but until they are complete , do not even consider car hire only one issue with the hotel - after travelling half way across the world - door to door in 15 hours - we were told that our room wasnt ready initial disappointment was soon overcome as we waited for an hour at the martini bar and had a few refreshing beers served by a smiling replica of ronaldinho this really is a spledid complex , ideal for adults our room was of a very high standard - 4 poster , jacuzzi and a well stocked fridge replenished every day i do not believe you get any advantage by paying for an ocean view room as the grounds are so well kept and colourful you cant help but get a great view each morning as you draw the curtains we really enjoyed the selection of meals which included the opportunity to dine at a variety of global a la carte locations all with air conditioning the french , mexican , italian and 'spice ' being our favourites all staff were extremely friendly at all times and most of them , i believe , really deserved the odd dollar or two for their pleasant and sincere approach to guests welfare whether you prefer the beach or pool both offer a clean and tidy environment - the ocean can be a bit powerful but good fun crashing through the breakers or trying to stay on a boogie - board i have noticed a number of reviews referring to the mossies - i can tell you that they are there in numbers , there was no evidence of them for the first 3 to 4 days but they must have come to life all of a sudden and went to town they do not normally like me , but for one night they had a good feast on a night we deceided to eat in the open evening entertainment is lively and wide ranging , not always my cup of tea but judging by the whooping and hollering of the audience (90 - 95% usa / canada ) went down a treat you can also pay a visit to the casino and try your hand or sit at the bar and watch others lose during the daytime , and only if you wish , you can take part in a wide range of activities every day eeez showtime including [ - - ] volleyballwe tracked the weather forecast a good 10 days before we left and were dismayed to see everyday showing a minimum of rain with frequent thunderstorms even when we got there the rolling 3 day forecast posted daily at the concierge desk showed exactly the same pattern the reality was one heavy downpour on one afternoon surrounded by daily , continuous sunshine all in all , a truly memorable and brilliant holiday if we did not have a policy of looking for somewhere new each holiday we would beback like a shot - however if we did , i think i 'd ring them the day before to get our room ready they do , however , have a branch in cancun , mexico , so that will definitely be on our shortlist for 09 hope this is helpful 
excellence does not deliver on its promises my husband and i vacationed at excellence during the second week of june we had been to the following all ??nclusive resorts : sandals st lucia , sandals whitehouse , sandals ocho rios , and aventura spa palace we absolutely loved those resorts and were looking forward to our trip to excellence punta cana we read many reviews on trip advisor and other sites , but what really convinced us to go was the information on the excellence website and the ways in which they portrayed themselves we could not wait to go to this resort , thinking that it would definitely rival if not beat the quality of the other all inclusive that we had visited we were sorely disappointed by this resort excellence has all the potential to be an exquisite resort , but unfortunately they fall very short of this one of the biggest problems at this resort is the language barrier it is very hard to communicate with the majority of the staff if you don?? speak spanish i will breakdown my experience at this resort into major categories and rate them against the other resorts we have been to airport transfer : we booked our transfer through tourinta tours the ride takes about 1 hour to 1 5 hours depending on how many other resorts the bus you are on stops at the roads are pretty bad and i was carsick the entire time however , the transfers are pretty similar to any caribbean island you go to unless the resort is located really close to the airport what was different about excellence compared to the other resorts was the difficulty we encountered in getting back to the airport at other resorts we have stayed at , you are given a specific time at which you would be picked up to go to the airport during your check - in at excellence , however , we had to meet with the tourinta tours representative the next day at a scheduled time , so that he could give us our departure time ( as well as try to sell us some excursions ) apparently , we were supposed to check in with him throughout the week to keep confirming our time of departure we did not do that , because we were not told to do that and consequently almost missed our bus back to the airport in fact , our names were not even on the departure list and we had to take a different bus to the airport because there was no room for us on the tourinta tours bus do yourself a favor??ay $60 and take a taxi pools/beachthe pools at this resort are excellent we really did enjoy then and they are on par with the pools at the other resorts that we have stayed at the beach is large and beautiful the ocean is a bit rough , but lots of fun if you enjoy playing in the waves this beach is on the atlantic side , so it was no where near as calm as the other caribbean resorts that we have been to groundsthe grounds are beautiful and well groomed they are also on par with the grounds at the other resorts that we have stayed at roomsthe rooms are okay they are definitely not as posh as they are advertised on the website when we arrived to our room on the first day , we had no hot water , the scale had no batteries , and the ceiling fan was making a clanging noise this was fixed quickly with a visit to the concierge desk the jacuzzi tub was nice , but the drain in our tub did not close properly , so the water would slowly drain out beware , that the mattresses are rock hard and there is no pillow menu serviceagain , there is a huge language barrier and that affects the service there are some staff members that don?? speak a word of english so it?? like you can?? understand them and they can?? understand you the maid service was spotty some days they don?? show up , or they don?? replenish your towels or toiletries much better maid service at all the other resorts we have stayed at the room service was timely all the bars were great and all of the drinks delicious the drinks were definitely on par with the other resorts that we had stayed at foodthis was our major complaint with this resort again , the language barrier did not help the breakfast buffet was exactly the same everyday and the choices were limited : same fruit , same exact items at the omelet station , same items in chaffing dishes the lunch buffet was almost the same on a daily basis the food was just okay and most of it was fried and greasy all the other all - inclusive resorts that we had been to had buffets that were at least twice as large and varied selections on a daily basis the restaurant meals were a hit or miss most of the items that were described on the menu were not what you received for example , the menu stated spinach and arugula salad , but romaine was brought out instead we ordered cannoli for desert and were brought out a pencil size chocolate shell stuffed with pudding i ordered shrimp stuffed with crab and topped with a garlic sauce and i got luke warm shrimp with no crab or sauce on mashed potatoes every meal sort of went like that the language barrier was pretty significant to where we would order coke and get diet coke the servers were so confused that they were refilling glasses of wine with the wrong kind of wind we did not eat at any of the themed outside buffets because they served the same exact food at dinner that they served that day at lunch and we thought that recycled food was pretty gross and , never have we had recycled or old food at any of the other resorts needless to say , the food here was way below the quality of food at other resorts entertainmentthe entertainment was cheesy??ome shows were better than others this is pretty standard at all the all - inclusive resorts in conclusion , i would not recommend this resort because there are others that are similarly priced that are much better and more consistment 
great time at excellence i will start off by saying this resort is great , but i don?? think they are ready for gay and lesbian travelers so , if you are a lesbian couple be mindful and if you are a gay couple do not go to dominican republic , or at least not to excellence this opinion was based on the following statement made by one of the entertainment instructors during a dance lesson ? ladies okay in dr , but 2 guys no okay in the dr? don?? get me wrong i did not feel uncomfortable here i have just found other places to more accepting and gay friendly with that said i still have very good things to say about our stay at excellence i read the reviews every day and found them to be extremely helpful , so here is mine to and from airport ? yes it is long and rough , but not that bad if you have a good driver we had a very good driver there and a terrible one back about 1 hr 15 mins beautiful , very well kept grounds the nature trail was very cool there are peacocks , flamingos , turtles , all kinds of birds , some frisky geese and two beautiful resident parrots ( the male bites , be careful ) the pools are so beautiful and crystal clear and always very clean , we liked the cascade much better than the main there is more room and a more relaxed atmosphere the gym is top notch and the equipment is very new rooms - we had a garden view ground floor in building 3 it was awesome you could actually kind of call it an ocean view in my opinion we had our own little patio with table and chairs and a hammock we got a lot of use out of the rooms are very clean , nice size beds ( a little hard ) , nice big jacuzzi tubs , always a stocked mini - fridge and the air conditioner always worked only complaint about the room is if you use your own hairdryer the breaker always tripped and had to be reset so turn off the tv and lights if you use your own beach ??he beach at this resort is the best it is huge , plenty of chairs , beds , shade and 2 bars to serve you the water is no where near as strong as people say in the reviews , i was in almost every day or evening with no problems at all and there were plenty of other people in as well take a 30 foot walk to the right side of the resort and it is calm , clear and beautiful caribbean waters i would classify the food here as good , not great , not bad but good breakfast buffet was decent with lots to choose from our favorite for lunch was the buffet at toscana they have pizza , pasta , hot food and a nice salad bar if you don?? feel like leaving the pool a guy comes around and delivers pizza and they are pretty good if you are at the beach and don?? feel like leaving they have bbq?? on the beach if you want to eat at agave make sure you go early we went there twice between 8-9pm and were turned away both nights due to being booked we liked to eat late so there was a wait every night but not too bad our favorites were spice and barcelona i thought chez isabell was okay but my girlfriend really liked her meal we ordered room service only once and it was not that great most of the staff are very friendly and full of energy i would like to give shout outs to : anotonio ? martini bar domingo ? cielo bar sara ? waitress at the nightly shows inez ? entertainment and miguel ? our very sweet waiter 3 nights at dinner i was disappointed in the lack of tipping by people ( especially non - americans ) we tipped $1 for every round of drinks ( more for sara at night she was great ) , usually $5 for dinner , $2 for breakfast and lunch and $2 for our maid every day we probably spent about $150 in tipping our 7 days there the few negatives ? on arrival our cable did not work and was not fixed until the next day we ordered room service one night and it did not come at all probably not the resorts fault but my girlfriend got very sick for about 2 ? days , so if you do not have an iron gut like myself just be prepared because we talked to quiet a few people that either got sick and had to stay in or at least had some sort of issues with their stomachs one lady had to be flown out of the resort she got so bad last thing is the bugs make sure you bring plenty of bug spray and use it all the time oh and one more thing if you are an animal lover don?? do the horse back riding the horses aren?? taken care of that well and it is kind of sad had a great time at this fabulous resort and would go back for sure 
excellence punta cana just got back from ??xcellence? punta cana - - - overall experience was good to great the property was well kept , service was great , and the food was ok but not great the pool area was very clean and relaxing we did not feel crowded anywhere we went on the resort i think it was because there are so many places to hangout during the day , pools or beach , that you felt like there were few couples at the resort the beach area was nice and clean , but the resort faces the atlantic ocean side , so the water is not great for ocean activities right on the resort pay attention to the dress code for the restaurants as guys need to be in long pants for 5 out of the 7 restaurants don?? forget your bug spray my wife and i did the couple?? massage at the spa ( well worth it ) and had a very nice experience during our vacation 
great honeymoon atmosphere my husband and i spent our honeymoon at excellence the resort was absolutely beautiful we were happy with our stay and never left the resort the week we were there we booked an ocean view room which was not available when we arrived the room we accepted , overlooking the waterfall pool , was very nice with the standard whirpool tub in the main room the water pressure in the shower was good and there was always enough hot water the resort credited us money that we used for a couple 's massage on the beach ( romantic and cool , with champagne and desserts after ) and almost covered a second couple 's massage at the spa the massages were not the best i 've ever had , but they were more than adequate we booked through vip travel agency ( stumbled upon through some booking website ) and they were very professional and included travel directly to and from the airport the van ride is bumpy and a little scary there are lots of potholes and swerving and the road is shared by all sort of automobiles , motorcycles , and even people riding horses the quality of the food varied by restaurant , with the grill being the most consistently good items often differ from the menu description , particularly for room service we ordered some from room service the first few days then realized the breakfast buffet at toscana was far better than anything delivered unfortunately , my husband got food poisoning the last day we were there we do not know what caused it but he did notice an undercooked shrimp on his plate at barcelona the day before he did not eat it , but maybe it tainted what he did eat for entertainment , there are nightly shows , including a fun michael jackson one we spent a few nights playing blackjack at the tiny casino as well worth noting : there is one atm on the premises and it only dispenses pesos the front desk will break larger bills for you in dollars but they will not exchange although tips are included , additional tips are appreciated and very commonplace in the $1-5 range we only tipped waiters who were exceptional but gave additional tips to the friendlier bartenders , room service , and cleaning staff the gift shops at the resort were pretty lame and had no good souvenirs but vendors occasionally sold jewelry and art on tables in the evenings and on the beach the rooms have a safe so i would recommend just bringing a good chunk of cash with you this was our first visit to an all - inclusive and i loved the couples atmosphere no sleazy guys trying to pick you up because everyone seemed happy with their companion keeping everyone tipsy and well - fed also contributed to a very friendly atmosphere the staff was overwhelmingly nice there are lots of nice touches , like a bottle of champagne in the room , stocked mini - fridge slippers , etc we did not pay for the excellence upgrade or the honeymoon package and we felt we had everything we wanted pool towels go quickly and are not replenished later in the day we learned the first day to get up before 10 and lay claim to towels and chairs before we meandered to breakfast there were always seats available but if you want along the pool or one of the giant bed things , claim early for some odd reason , the television stations were denver no idea why not a full cable package , but the denver local affiliates , cnn , starz and a 24 hour porn channel were all there we rented a movie the one rainy day did not use any bug spray and we each got about 5-10 mosquito bites during the week did not see any lizard type things but there was a crab in the elevator one day maybe its influenced by the after wedding glow and just being happy , we had a fantastic time despite the room change and the bout of food poisoning though my husband has been still suffering from that for the several days we 've been home and had it happened earlier in the week , it could 've ruined our trip 
absolutely loved it we arrived in punta cana from a long flight from denver and we absolutely amazed at what a beautiful place this was to be expected : the vendors , taxi drivers and others are real pushy at the airport you need to be careful and follow your paperwork and locate your travel desk if you booked through an agency having done this before , i knew what to expect and pushed my way through i see most people complained about the roads to their hotel , come on , these roads are expected here and it 's the same in mexico get over it , as in an hour ( more or less ) you will arrive at your hotel to paradise i do have to admit , it was tiring after a long day of traveling , but when we arrived at the hotel , awwww , paradise good : everything about the hotel was great our room was clean , cool and nice the staff were great although we encountered a few ladies that looked like they had a bad day working the restaurant but otherwise , the staff treated everyone well and were very attentive to our needs the room was great , a four poster bed , well stocked mini fridge , air conditioning , great view , turn down service great music performed by a live band kept us going by the cafe kafe bar outside kudos to braulio , the bartender there , he was lively , fun and danced his way around the bar entertaining all of us while making drinks with a smile beautiful garden that brought peace of mind when you walked through it the ponds were filled with tons of fish , turtles , and there were a pair of parrots hanging out , birds and even a rooster , hen and family wandering around they have avocado and lime trees , small bridges and peacocks cocolocos and mamajuana are good , but you need to watch out , those mamajuanas will get ya it serves as a great shot and they say it 's an aphrodisiac as well lol they do serve no name brand alcohol with most drinks , but will happily serve you name brand as well , but you have to ask for it food was good for the most part we ate at the lobster house , toscana and the grill for dinner the lobster was great , i had it grilled with a garlic butter sauce cyprian was a great server at the grill the breakfast buffet was good with lots of fruit and breakfast items to choose from including pancakes and omelettes the beach was clean , tidy and had plenty of chairs to choose from with beachside service including drinks and mini pizzas served right at your chair we did the saona island and bavaro water excursions they were just as great as the review read here we snorkled and had a blast raul from bavaro water excursion was a great snorkle guide not so good : it rained heavily one night were were there , but it did not affect our trip or plans , but the rain is heavy and brings out those pesky mosquitos mosquitos - - - ugh , i wore deep woods off spray - which is the heavy duty stuff and they still got me good yet , my boyfriend did get one single bite darn pesky mosquitos something ( or someone ) was floating in the ocean on one day at the beach the lifeguards on duty steadily watched it , yet , did not bother to take a seadoo out to check it out i do not know what it was and everyone was trying to draw conclusions , driftwood maybe but right before that , my boyfriend saved someone who had swam out past the bouy ( people - they are there for a reason , do not swim past them ) and brought her to shore by the time he brought her to shore , the lifeguard was still trying to put on his boogie board tie be careful , the water can be rough vendors in santo domingo plaza are pushy and do give you free things , yet want to charge you for them be aware , just ignore them and keep walking or they will sweep you up but i do have to admit that one sold t - shirts and we got them for a bargain overall , this was a great experience and i would recommend it to everyone keep one thing in mind , as you do not have to tip , i would still recommend you carry at least $100 worth of $1 and $5 bills for the great service they provide you will still receive it whether or not you tip 
great all - around we did not want to leave i chose this resort and surprised my wife with the destination i was meticulous in my search and read a host of reviews from this site , travel coordinators and brochures i felt it was risky to go to the dominican republic over a standard resort vacation , say to jamaica but i wanted something different with equal quality my wife was ecstatic to find out before boarding the plane that we were heading to the dr , and throughout the ensuing week , our expectations were met and exceeded the rideit was bumpy but bearable if you have motion sickness , take some medicine , as the infrastructure suffers from formidable potholes and the shuttle chauffeurs suffer from lack of steady driving technique but it 's a chance to enjoy a beautiful , lush countryside , so not so bad arrivalthe excellence club is worth the extra money , i 'd say you have private check - in and access to a snack bar that is nearly always filled with fruit and other delectable dishes the staff greets you with smiles and cool towels that makes the road trip all worth it the club also has internet connection , a lounge , and a waiter who is always floating around to supply you with drinks or espresso for your coffee or almost anything you 'd need the eatswe loved them take advantage of every course ( get your money 's worth ) agave and chez isabelle were probably our favorites the buffet breakfast at toscano was more than you need and pretty tasty the salads and fruits were always fresh the wine tasted magnificent the service was impeccable - - every waiter we had seemed so eager to serve the main pool is huge and resembles a lazy river it has a swim - up bar with helpful bartenders the landscaping , sunbathing spots , and overall atmosphere of the place made it paradise the shorethe first 3-4 days boasted beautiful , calm water in a secluded cove dotted by palm trees we were able to wade deep into the water but the latter half of our stay was not so sublime the wind and waves picked up and many beach - goers were stuck to the sand , as hotel staff called waders in from the water other than that , it is still beautiful , but if you are dead - set on swimming , this shore may be a risk you do not want to take as it is not typically calm ( according to locals and many of the prior reviews ) mint for pillow room service was slow , but terribly friendly and often the food was great in quality breakfast was good one day but not the next the pizza is thin but flavorful the desserts are good , according to my wife we got room service every night ( because we could ) but do not harbor great expectations in this area extrasthe mini - bar in the room is always stocked with coke , beer , etc and you can make special requests the jacuzzi in the room is sweet the whole room is just really nice just really nice , and unique it is comfortable bed slightly hard but very comfortable we had the oceanview junior suite , which overlooked both pool and ocean it was pretty much heavenly the shows were good , but we did not see many of them the ambience at night was romantic and we enjoyed just taking walks the spa massage was good pretty standard back massage , i think the spa area is really nice and they have many options overallthis is a great resort it was fun and relaxing and had everything we could want now i have a new picture in my mind to associate with paradise my wife speaks fluent spanish , which made coordination/communication more smooth , but speaking the language is by no means necessary those at the resort i talked to who had been to sandals resorts said they enjoyed this one more i came away very satisfied with my decision , and my wife loved it , which accomplished my main goal 
go to excellence we have just returned from a week at excellence and it was all i could ask for and more i did much traveladvisor reading when deciding where to go ( for my honeymoon actually ) and picked excellence and really lucked out the resort and service were top notch , hitting the level found at the sandals resorts but for less the only complaint we found from other couples was the ride to the place from the airport it was a rough bumpy , speeding , caribbean ride for a hour but we thought it was exciting but some did not and wont that said , you cant go wrong for the money i will be going back as soon as i can 
amazing incredible place we chose excellence for our honeymoon getaway based on the reviews here and that it was an adults only all inclusive resort and we could not be more thrilled the resort is large , but not overwhelmingly perfect balance of entertainment and romance the ambiance is one of pure romance and relaxation - highly recommended if those are your goals for a retreat the place is very clean , the air even smells sweet ( ) , the food is by far amazing ( better than we expected ) , and the staff is highly professional in fact what impressed us the most is the genuine friendliest of the dominican people that work at the resort everyone is super friendly and very helpful even the ones that could not speak english fluently worked there magic with a big smile you can spend your days lounging by the pool or on the beach sipping their special tropical rum drinks ( my favorite , the 'cocoloco ' - a fresh opened coconut with cream  rum ) , going on excursions ( such as horseback riding or riding on avi 's to the mountains , etc ) , or dining in one of many amazing restaurants we did not try the casino - it looked pretty small , but seemed quite popular and , the nightlife is quite diverse : from nightly shows in the main stage of the lobby area - which is beautiful and so spacious candlelight , two bars , plenty of comfy seats to lounge in and you can feel the ocean breeze throughout - to checkin out the night club where you can dance all night - to taking a walk on the beach or lounging on a hammock - to enjoying a fresh beach bbq on the beach prepared by the resort the list is endless of what you can do and , may i not forget to mention the spa so , all this being said , we were just extremely thrilled from our experience at excellence a big shout out to some of the staff that we remember : matthias at the concierge desk , carlos who helped us with our bags and gave us a huge greeting every day , juan carlos - one of the talented entertainers with a sweet smile finally , two our two friends who we named bob  barbara - the two parrots that hang out in the garden in front what an amazing vacation away from it all a true paradise it really was 'excellente ' 
most relaxing trip of my life this trip was phenomenal althought the hour and a half bus ride to the resort from the airport started us out on a not so positive note it was the only element of our trip that i did not love this resort is fantastic besides the food , drinks and buildings being so impressive we were most impressed by the staff they were fantastic from the wait staff to the maid service we could not have been more pleased not to mention our fantastic bellman or shall we say bellboy , tony he started our stay out on a fantastic note and really helped to make us feel welcome by addressing us everytime we saw him throughout our trip i would have to say the best part of this trip though , was the entertainment team as two single woman going to a mostly couples oriented resort , we did not feel like outcasts at all as the entertainment team really went out of there way to make sure we were having a good time from getting us to play volleyball in the pool to taking merengue lessons on the beach , we had a fantastic time , not to mention we always had more girlfriends and good looking gentlemen to dance with at the disco at night i would like to especially acknowledge ines , alta gracia , johana , alexandra , juan carlos , luciano , franklin , julio and joel for going out of there way to entertain us the entire week what a wonderful and relaxing vacation we had and i truely felt like i left this resort with some great friends they were so much fun and so entertaining i ca not wait to return as this resort allows you to relax as much as you want or to party and play hard , its all up to the guest and there was not a single child there to cry the entire time 
excellence was excellent excellence was the perfect place for our honeymoon we picked this all inclusive because it was an adult only resort and because the pictures in the brochure were beautiful we were pleased to find out that when we arrived it was like we stepped into one of those pictures in the brochure the hospitality was incredible , such a wonderful staff on the resort that always welcomed us with a smile serving us the best food  drinks 24 hours a day we enjoyed the horseback riding on the beach also water aerobics with joel , frankin  juan carlo ( very entertaining individuals ) was a great workout and lots of laughs and we defininetly want to give a shout out to domingo rosa who entertained us each night with his phenominal sax music ( my husband was pulling me up onto the dance floor every song ) : ) other names we remember ebeth a wonderful hostess with the greatest smile , junior a very nice waiter  our cute little bartender jonathan wish we could remember everyone 's names like the folks who greeted us  checked us in when we arrived and many other waiters  waitresses even the maids were so pleasant even though we do not remember names we will hold their kind faces in our memories along with the memories of a beautiful landscape with photo opportunties at every glance we will absolutely be back to this resort our deepest thanks to the excellence staff  resort for a wonderful honeymoon 
my husband and i stayed at the excellence for our honeymoon and we loved it pack bigger clothes because you will eat fantastic food and drink a lot we loved the staff , the restaurants , the pool , and channel 21 do not forget to pack your own bug spray and itchy cream - i was bitten up definately take the bike tour given by lucas - it was so much fun the only negative i had was that the bed was a little too firm and i was not used to it a fantastic positive : the onsite doctor was great my husband got sick and we saw him at midnight he gave my husband a prescription and we were on the beach the next day i would definately go again and i would go to the other excellences 
overall we had an amazing time on our honeymoon at excellence all of the staff we encountered were incredibly friendly and accommodating there was always something to do as the entertainment team was providing activities throughout the day we took a bike tour down the street outside of the resort with alexandria as our guide it was just my husband and i with her and she did an excellent job of guiding us and interacting she made the experience a memorable one and really helped us learn more about the dominican culture we thought the food was absolutely excellent 
fantastic , but watch out for the mosies what a place the staff were perfect and franklin gives supberb spanish lessons , check him out , he is fun and very enthustiastic the food is great , no real problems , there is a buffet for breakfast and lunch with alacarte in the evenings , which i must admit got a bit too much by the second week , the option to have a buffet dinner would have gone down well , the rooms are spacious and very clean , with great air con and a huge four poster bed , i swear i lost my husband on more than one occasion two words of advice first : buy the mosquito repellent from the on site pharmacy , its called off and cost about 14 dollars , you will need it , they are abundant and it was the only draw back to the holiday , so go prepared , secondly take you own inflatable lilo ( pool bed ) , there are not enough to go round and the americans ( bless em ) do tend to hog them and also take them out of the pool which the hotel asks you not do do , i will say that we were so impressed with the overall quality and atmosphere of the excellence ( barring mosquitoes ) we have booked to go back there for christmas , and i cant wait 
stress free vacation we stayed at excellence may28th till june 3rd being self employed its hard getting away from more then a long 3 or 4 day weekend so being able to spend 6 nights at epc was a nice treat first thing i wanna say which has no barring on epc itself is if you can book your flight and not have to use miami as a stop do it it is the worst airport i have ever been in it was not bad on the way to punta cana but customs was a mad house there was so much confusion on where to go and how to get there and with it being a major international airport the customs lines are long airport was beautiful never been to a port where its all open air and thatched roofs we were in and out of the airport in 30 minutes tops we booked out transfer with mikes taxi 's ibk they were right there as you walk out of the airport the driver was nice he spoke little english and we spoke little spanish so we did not communicate with each other very well lol the ride was fine was not horrible but i can see where some people complain about it being rough or dangerous at times its long if you get caught behind some of the large construction trucks if you get lucky and have a semi clear ride it could be under an hour if not expect 75 minutes or so pulling up to the lobby is much like any other resort you get the customary champagne and wet towel we were escorted to the excellence club for check in by my man antonio who we would see all week he remember our names all week and is an asset to this resort which may seem strange since he was a bellboy but he really has great customer service skills we meet roberto he runs the excellence club and is the best was willing to do anything he could to make sure we had the best time while we were there throughout the week as we walked by the ??lub? we would get a wave or an hola or asked if we needed anything to make our stay even better took a few minutes for check in and chatted for a few then they took us to our room we stayed in swim up room 10004 it was nice it was clean and there was a flat screen tv all a man needs right we had a nice bar filled with different hard liquors that we actually never used only thing we did was asked for a bottle of wine each day and they brought it by in the afternoon each day they had 3 choices of beer presidante bohemia and bud ended up changing the bud for number 1, which is a dominican beer , which ended up being our favorite they also had a few snacks including kit kats oreo 's and crackers which we found came in handy each day the room was one of the few that didn?? have lounge chairs right in front of the room or a hammock right outside your door neither was a big deal since we asked for a room that was closed to the water we did have 2 chairs and a table outside our door though drinks were good i will say i hear a lot of people complain about the drinks not being strong and this has a lot to do with the type of drink you order if you are ordering sammy sosa?? , daiquiris margarita?? etc this will more then likely be the case because they are premixed and in a machine just waiting to be poured out you can go anywhere and the drink will be weak from these machines all you need to do is ask for a little extra run or tequila when you order it and they will put it in any of the other drinks that they pour and aren?? pre made you wont have a problem with food was good we ate at every restaurant except for barcelona the mediterranean i was a little worried about the lobster since i have read in numerous reviews was not good it was my favorite meal i got the cajun spiced grilled lobster and it was delicious the grill was pretty good as well and then portions at the grill were large actually too larger for us we had a ton of food we didn?? even finish the beef was a little overcooked then what i asked for but it was still easily cut with a butter knife so it wasn?? dry at all just not quite how i asked for it not a biggie spice was a good meal also it?? the asian restaurant and the sushi was pretty good as was the duck i got after all the raving about the french restaurant here on t/a and from talking to other guests at the resort we were really looking forward to our meal and ended up disappointed not because it was bad , it was good just not great the service was ??xcellent? here the best we had all week for dinner i think it had to do with higher expectations the meal was good nothing blew us away then toscana was the italian restaurant its lacking in atmosphere but this is just due to it being a multi purpose restaurant its connected to barcelona and kinda has a school cafeteria feel to it this is because it also serves the buffet for breakfast and lunch food was good here though for lunch our favorite place was the grill it has a couple of lighter options for lunch when its hot and you don?? what heavy foods like burgers etc and the big reason we went there a lot was because of the service we got from ricky he was great , always attentive and would chat with those that were interested in having a conversation and would leave you alone if you were having a private conversation with each other never an empty glass i normally had wine with lunch and i walked out each afternoon a little buzzed because he always had my glass filled i actually had to ask him to slow down loli will say we had no wait times at any meal we showed up to meals between 6:45 and 7:30 each evening and the restaurants were near empty so it looks like most people eat late we were actually disappointed a little since we like to have a few drinks and chat before dinner the meals also only took 30 minutes tops which seemed strange to us if they are trying to have upscale meals we were also a little disappointed with this since we got all dressed up for a meal and it was so short i am sure most will like this but we were never in a hurry so this wasn?? our preference beach and pools were nice the beach was clean no trash or rocks and we had plenty of room to pick a chair all day long the water was black or red flagged each day but it didn?? have any problems out in the water you can get out there chest high without being worried about the rip current any deeper and you need to use caution pool was good we woke up the first morning early fully expecting the chair wars to begin so i got up at 6:30 looked out our sliding glass door and not a person in site took a shower etc watched some tv looked out again around 7:45 right before we went to breakfast and there were only 2 spots taken so we went and saved a spot thinking we would be outta luck if we waited till after breakfast we ate and went back to the room to change headed out to the pool around 9:30 and there were atleast half of the lounges still open but most of the shaded lounges were taken by this time this was how it was everyday of our stay 
excellente excellence at punta cana was fantastic the staff was trained perfectly and always greeted you with a warm smile the rooms were perfect great sized and the minibar being full everyday was a great help the pool was always clean and chairs were always available the bar staff at the beach and pool were fantastic and always made sure you had what you wanted the food at all the restaurants was top quality i have stayed in plenty of all - inclusives that valued quantity over quality not excellence , this hotel made sure that each dish was prepared to the best they could all ingredients were great the beach was also beautiful although the water in front was slightly wavy , if you walked to the edge of the beach there is a slight curve that provides for clearer , warmer and clamer water that is great for floating , and snorkeling i would definitly recommend this hotel for a romantic weekend for two , a honeymoon , an older couple , couple when i do return to punta cana this is where i will make my stay 
perfect honeymoon in every way i read more than a hundred reviews of this hotel and was very scared y some of the comments but decided to go nonetheless me and my new wife went on our honeymoon and i was expecting the average resort but thought this would just be nice due to the fact that it was adult only the whole week we had zero problems with the room , the resort , the staff , or any of our excursions people complain about the drive it is not that bad at all its about an hour but you get to see the country i will admit many parts of the country are very impoverished , have trash scattered , and the drivers there are very courageous with passing but not once was i worried about getting into a wreck i actually really enjoyed the rides around the country to different locations the beach was by far the best attribute here the whole country is covered in palm trees and the sand is cleaned daily so it is very soft on the feet unlike other areas in the carribean this beach actually has waves that you can swim in or merely enjoy listening too another plus is that these are natural beaches many resorts make their beaches look pretty in pictures but are hideous and muddy in person have stayed in many other all inclusive carribean resorts and the beach at the excellence is unbeatable the food here was also better than anywhere i have ever stayed we ate at almost every restaurant and were never disappointed i recommend the italian or the asian restaurant when they say all inclusive they really mean it all the food , including 24 hour room service ( fast by the way ) is free the minibar is restocked daily with beer , sodas , water , snacks , and any liquor you want i recommend the excellence club room the minibar is upgraded , you receive free movie rentals , you have access to a 24 hour indoor buffett , as well as a better spot on the beaches (2 different styles of beach beds ) when i saw they have beds on the beach i was thinking they would always be wet or at least gross these beds dried very quicly , are cleaned daily , and the cushions were very comfortable i fell asleep multiple times on these beds if you are on your honeymoon definitely get the honeymoon package ( free with ocean front excellence club jr suite or higher ) the dinner on the beach included chapagne , steak , potato , and lobster on your first night you get flowers , fruit , and champagne the package also includes champagne breakfast in bed , more than we could eat and te best part of the package is the couples massage they first give you a feet exfoliation and massage then they take you to a room together where you can both get a 50 minute full body massage this massage was excellent for both of us and the spa itself was very nice the nighty shows are hit and miss but include a michael jakson show and a circus while you watch on very comfortable chairs a waitress brings you all the drinks you want there are many moderately priced excursions to go on , or you can pay a taxi 80 dollars to take you anywhere you want for 3 dollars i recommend going to higeuy this city has a beautiful church , and shopping or to saona island , the beach is not amazing but the water is very blue and the catamaran ride is fun with included rum , beer , and food the whole resort was nicer than any ( including others that were much more expensive ) i have ever stayed at this resort had excellent beaches , no drunk teenagers , fast service , great food , and wonderful workers my honeymoon was absolutely perfect my wife was very pleased and i have never seen her happier i had zero problems the whole week , that is until i got back to the states and expected equal service at a hotel here mosquitos are here so remember to bring bug spray 
awesome vacation let me just start off saying that if you have read negative reviews about this resort , ignore them some people can just not never be pleased and should just stay home my wife and i are 30 and have been on many all inclusive vacations ( in mexico and dominican ) overall , this is one of the best all inclusives we have been to the beach was beautiful and clean yes , there are waves , but the water is still nice , warm , clean and refreshing plenty of places to sit on the beach , in the sun or in the shade loved the beds and hammocks on the beach the main pool was excellent it was huge and very clean if you want a good spot by the pool , i would suggest getting down there between 8:30 and 10:00 a there is also a smaller pool with a waterfall if you really want peace and quiet the drink service by the pool is non - stop and the pool bar is fun the food was great we were not so pleased with the breakfast , but were very pleased with lunch and dinner if you are lazy and do not want to leave the pool , they actually deliver small pizza pies poolside , which my wife and i loved the pizza was actually decent if you want to sit down for lunch , the lunch buffet was great plenty of choices and good food room service is also good and is 24 hours there are many places to eat for dinner my favorite was the mediterranean ( amazing paella ) and my wife 's favorite was the french restaurant for all the guys out there , bring pants because you cannot wear shorts to most of the restaurants the mexican , italian and chinese were great as well the only place we did not eat at was the lobster house , but we heard it was not that great they also do a bbq outside on friday , which was really good it was nice to sit outside and enjoy the beautifull atmosphere the staff at this resort is hands down the best these people work so hard to make your vacation amazing bring money to tip because the staff really deserves it remember , a small amount of money goes a long way down there the shows at night were great most all inclusive places have very cheesy entertainment not the excellence the shows ( which start at 10:00 every night ) were great the pre and post show entertainment is fantastic as well ( music , etc my wife and i did the horseback ride (30 minutes free through the resort ) we loved it i played golf at la cana golf resort , which i booked through the concierge it was a long ride , but well worth it the course was beautiful and right on the clear blue ocean there is so much i am leaving out i do not have one complaint about this resort it was the best seven days and nights away from the real world go see for yourself and you will not regret it i would go to the excellence again in a heartbeat 
excellence is a magical paradise we were at excellence may 1 ? 15th to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and had an amazing time we stayed in an excellence club oceanview suite and thought the upgrade was well worth it nothing was too much trouble for roberto and his team in the excellence club concierge service and we used the club quite a bit as well miguelina in the club was such a sweetheart we stayed in building 10 just down the hall from the excellence club and could lay in bed and see and hear the ocean we came back to our room numerous times and found our jacuzzi tub filled with bubbles and rose petals and always had wonderful towel art we had a flat screen tv and ipod dock which we loved using when getting showered and dressed for dinner we ate at all the restaurants except the lobster house and were never disappointed with a meal make sure you try the chateaubriand in the french restaurant spice was excellent as well we felt that excellence had the best all inclusive food we have had at any resort including mexico , cuba , jamaica and the dominican they also bring around pizza at the pool and beach if you don?? want to dry off for lunch and they make some amazing lunches on the beach as well ( fajitas , paella , etc we never waited to get into a restaurant but if you show up later and have a wait you will be given a beeper that lights up when your table is ready go have a drink somewhere and relax we were too tired for the shows most nights but really enjoyed the michael jackson , chris blizzard and the 70?? and 80?? show we also loved listening and dancing to domingo?? wonderful sax he even autographed his cd?? for me that i bought for my father who is also a sax player i bought a set for myself as well we never had a problem getting chairs by the pool or beach but you did have to get up pretty early to reserve a bed i?? an early riser so i was always downstairs by 7:00 and had my choice of beds there is a separate section of beach marked as for use by excellence club members only which is not enforced but there were always plenty of chairs and palapas available there sometimes it could be difficult to find a float but it seemed that people near the excellence club end of the pool were pretty good about sharing the ocean is rough as they say it is one day out of 14 it was black flagged and the other days were red flag the waves are really fun to play in and you just have to be responsible if you go 300 meters to the right the water is turquoise clear and calm so you have the best of both worlds here we didn?? see a bug or use our spray the first week there but as the winds died down the second week we found that we had to spray with deep woods off with deet in the evening which worked well we had the romantic dinner on the beach our last night there ( which was an absolutely incredible steak and lobster dinner and a very romantic experience which we would recommend ) and sprayed really well and didn?? get any bites we had planned on doing 2 excursions but it was just too comfortable and easy to stay at the resort so that?? what we did we did go into plaza bavaro one day to visit steve?? corner bar and deliver a suitcase of items we took for beyond the beach and met steve who is a really great guy he has plans underway for renovating the bar and it sounds exciting we had lunch and a couple of presidente?? there and the prices were really reasonable we found the shopping at plaza bavaro to be too pressured we went to nancy?? shack on the beach at excellence just to the left of the resort and felt that we were treated very fairly she is from canada and doesn?? pressure you at all but is very helpful if you have questions we did a photography session with fran from the photo souvenir desk in the lobby and he was incredible and a lot of fun and very reasonably priced what a beautiful memento we came home with the staff are all incredible and hard working and really seem to enjoy their jobs we made it a point to tip workers that do not typically receive tips like maintenance and landscapers when we saw somebody doing a hard job in the heat ( anywhere from $5 - $20) and saw some of the biggest smiles imaginable the one thing that really struck me about the resort that i haven?? seen mentioned before is the management they seemed to be everywhere all the time and do an incredible job of making sure everything is perfect and everybody is happy i have never seen a better run resort than excellence it is always spotless and everything is first - rate we booked private transportation to and from the airport and will definitely do that again next time the trip really is not that bad you get to see the country and the drivers are all very capable and know what they are doing our driver asked us on the way back to the airport when we would be coming back and our answer was ??ext week , we??e just going home to get some more money? wishful thinking but we would go back to excellence in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anyone 
my husband and i booked our honeymoon here and absolutely loved it this is a couples only resort which is perfect for honeymooners the property is amazing , with about 7 restaurants , several pools , one with a swim up bar our package was all inclusive which is the way to go ( our favorite drinks were the coco loco 's ) there are plenty of activities and things to do that you do not even need to leave the resort my favorite activity was the horseback riding i have never been on a horse and it was amazing they take you through the woods and end up right on the beach i highly recommend this the resort is an hour away from airport , but it 's all worth it once you arrive 
perfect honeymoon my wife and i stayed at excellence for 12 days starting at the end of april for our honeymoon it was amazing we could have stayed a lot longer location : it was perfect a huge beach with lots of privacy grounds were beautiful and well kept if you walk the beach about a mile you can find calmer water all i want to say is domingo wow can that guy play the saxophone he is amazing i had never seen anyone as talentented as him his music is amazing he is the perfect night cap we bought 2 of his cd 's which are excelent ( if you are reading this domingo - hi from scott and marie from minnesota ) food : it was very good enjoyed all the restraunts service was great and the food did not dissapoint it exceeded our expectations looked forward to breakfast , lunch and dinner dining experiences david was our favorite waiter favorite spot was spice drinks : there is something for everyone i like beer , but we really enjoyed the sammy sosa 's excursions - we did 5 of them it would be very tough to rank them so i wo not saona island : wow was that a beautiful island and what a blast on the catamaran the crew on ours was a lot of fun atv : was a lot of fun , got very dirty went to a very cool cave , and got to swim in it very rememberable experience bavaro runner : neat to see got to tour a dominican home see coffee and cocoa being made see cigars made by hand and smoke them also eat a buffet lunch in the mountains james bond : cool to drive your own speedboat to a little splash pad and snorkling a must for adventurous people deep sea fishing : a good experience i caught a barracuda which was fun we went through alvin on the beach overall a first class resort that we plan on visiting again domingo we miss you and hope to make it back to see you play soon 
fabulous time - absolutely going back we had a wonderful time at excellence in punta cana the resort itself has a relaxed elegance that really outshines the other resorts in the area the staff was amazing - it was our first experience at an all inclusive and i was wary about the quality of customer service we would recieve each and every member of the hotel staff , from the bartenders and waiters to the entertainment staff , were truly gracious hosts and i left finally realizing what it means to be a welcome guest the adults only peice really adds a special touch to your time there we got to know other couples that were staying at the resort and trade wedding and engagement stories , and are we are even keeping in touch with one particular couple we really got along with if you are planning a vacation and are looking for something special for an engagment or honeymoon , i could not recommend excellence resort highly enough 
paradise paradise is the only way to describe this hotel we had the best time ever food was excellent staff could not do enough for you for you one example disaster struck my hair straighners would not work due the electricity supply being too low , the ladies in the spa went and bought me a pair the next day , how is that for service , really impressed with them when and if you do go please go look jose up at the kafe kafe bar , he became my husband whilst i was there , he is so funny animation team just wonderful definately going back ca not wait 
excellence exceeded our high expectations just returned from 7 days at the excellence and had a fantastic time rather than repeat the basic items in the previous reviews ( great landscaping , good reaturants , friendly staff etc ) i will focus on specific details that made the excellence special in this regard , i will compare the excellence to the #2 trip advisor - ranked resort in punta cana ( majestic colonial ) at which i stayed last year for a week beach party : super event at the excellence food was very good but the ambience of having dinner at the beach with 2 great bands playing was magical if you go to the excellence , do not miss this event the majestic colonial did not offer this type of beach front function sax player at martini bar : domingo the sax player was super i spoke to a number of other couples from large us cities and we all agreed the quality of the sax player was great the majestic colonial did not have the same quality of entertainment flexibility with restaurants : the excellence did not require any pre - planned reservations , so you had the ability to be spontaneous in respect to picking a restaurant and timing that suited you on any particular evening at the majestic , and other resorts i have stayed at , you have to rush to make all your restaurant reservations as soon as you arrive or you may not be able to get in at all having the flexibility and spontanity was very welcome on a vacation lunches on the beach : the paella on the beach was out of this world and the beachfront fajitas and burgers/chicken were also great lunch fare having the ability to eat on the beach was an unexpected convenience and pleasure small details : the gym at the excellence was large and very well maintained the towel service at the excellence was on the honour system versus the majestic colonial and others where you have to deposit your room key and then get to the towel station and pick up your key again the waiters providing full service to the pool and beach areas including offering pizza for a mid - day snack as well , we did not fly out until the evening , and jacqueline at the front desk let us use another hotel room to shower and change ( after check out ) at no cost the foregoing details are small points but they added up in the context of a ultra relaxing vacation at the excellence the one negative i would state about the excellence is the invisible sand bugs myself and a number of other guests did not notice the bugs during the day but upon return to the room in the late afternoon , we all had a number of bites on our ankles and legs the resolution to this issue is to use bug spray everyday whether you notice the bugs or not all in all , my stay at the majestic colonial last year was also very good but our vacation at the excellence this year was fantastic and it exceeded all of our expectations 
fantastic adults - only , all - inclusive for the money my wife and i were looking for a reasonably priced , all - inclusive get - away for an extended memorial day weekend the excellence in punta cana was just what we needed the resort itself was beautiful and a real welcome site after the hour long journey from the airport we were greeted with a warm welcome by the staff and escorted to the hotel club this was a slight upgrade from basic accomodations and i think it was worth it carlos , took our bags to the club consierge and helped the visit off to a great start though i only saw carlos in the mornings , heading to breakfast or the pool , he always greated me by name with a big smile everyone on staff greeted us in the halls with hola , but only carlos knew us by name every day the restaurants (7 in all ) were wonderful we really liked spice , the asian restaurant , where we had 2 excellent meals and received excellent service from vincent the lobster house disappointed us by burning the grilled lobster then again , being from new england , even a perfect carribean lobster may not have impressed us much finally , we ca not say enough about the wonderful energy and dedication of franklin he seemed to be involved in just about every activity around the resort excersize in the morning , language lessons by the pool , volleyball all day long ( it seemed ) and performances and the dance club at night we even had a chance to just sit and get to know him a little he works many hours , for many days and still kept up the energy and enthusiasm to make our stay more enjoyable we look forward to our next visit to this fantastic resort 
loved it loved it i enjoyed my stay frankie and the entertainment crew were excellent have no complaints i 've enjoyed my stay ill be back 
had a great time a uk slant on things i thought i would write a review of our holiday as the majority of reviews for this hotel are from america and i thought i would put a uk slant on the proceedings??e do speak the same language but do have cultural differences i will start by saying we had a wonderful time at the excellence hotel there seem to be 3 areas of disappointment with the hotel which in our opinion are a little harsh and in some avoidable? transfer - if anyone is aiming to spend this amount on a holiday they should investigate the hotel fully first we did , and we knew there was a problem with the roads from the airport to the hotel so no surprises that the transfer took about an hour along pot - holed roads , to be honest we have worse roads in mid wales ? i know the roads in america are superior so they would notice the conditions more our transfer was by a private company and not in a large coach , if you book a private transfer then look out for the guys in yellow shirts at the airport with vip logos a thomson?? coach transfer would take quite a bit longer as the excellence is one of the last , if not the last stop i would recommend sorting your own transfer even if you go by taxi it should only cost about $60 each way 2) insects - we knew we were going to a hot and humid environment so there would be insects that bite and cause irritation ? just buy some extra strength repellent and never leave your room without a covering we had some spray from boots that worked a treat i went to the beach one morning to watch the sunrise and forgot to spray and yes i was bitten quickly and frequently 3) food - ok they may use a little poetic licence by calling the restaurants ?? la carte? but the standard is far better than the majority of all inclusive hotels i would say the standard is somewhere between buffet style food and full restaurant food swaying more toward restaurant we had no issues with the waits for service and food , it was far quicker than anything you will find in a uk restaurant again i think this is a small cultural difference between the uk and america , we have been to america a few times and the service is always very , very quick there the good things? resort was impeccably clean and kept clean constantly , pool included the resort is mainly used for honeymoon and anniversary celebrations and about 75% - 85% of the clientele are american but there is a good mix of people and is very friendly i?? sorry if this upsets a few people but some americans do have very loud voices and at face value it can seem a little noisy sometimes but it?? not raucous or intimidating 2) staff were amazing ? very helpful and actually seemed to enjoy their work , often found them singing to themselves room was great ( we did upgrade to the club rooms ) we had a four poster bed a jacuzzi bath and an acceptable shower and toilet a table and chairs outside with a hammock4) pool and beach were excellent i did get up early to bagsy a good spot but didn?? really need to especially for the beach i will say though that i think we went at a slightly quieter time of the year lots of sun beds and four posters by the pool and sun beds , double beds and a few four - posters on the beach ? pool float mats did go quite quickly and take some flip flops ? the floor and sand will burn the soles of your feet , honestly the resort in on the border between the atlantic ocean and caribbean sea so does have so terrible currents and rip tides , you will not be able to swim very often ? most of the time the beach will have black or red flags you can take a stroll around the coastline to the caribbean sea and swim there food was better than ok but not brilliant breakfast options were incredible with either room service or buffet ( very good ? loads of choice ) lunch was fine with either a visit to the buffet or hotdogs and pizza and there was usually some sort of bbq on the beach dinner - we did not have a problem having to wait too long for a table at any of the restaurants ( longest 20 mins at the mexican as it?? a small room ) , most of the time we walked straight in if there is a wait the staff will give you a pager so you can go and get a drink anywhere in the hotel , when red flashing lights appear your table is ready , easy there was usually some sort of soiree on the beach as an option as well just as a note? at least one of the restaurants will be closed each night on rotation wow you can get seriously intoxicated there is alcohol everywhere and we found the service both pool and beach side was excellent the minibar is stocked daily and has a good combination of alcoholic and soft drinks and plenty of water bottles ? ice is available from the ice makers in the centre of the building block just as a note? i saw no difference in service with tipping or not we tended to tip 1-2 dollars each time and 5 for the restaurants but there is no expectation at all 7) activities ? can?? comment too much as we didn?? go to explore the island we did go horse riding which was great ( even booked a second ride ) i must admit we never trust the excursions from hotels anywhere , they do tend to be a bit of a rip off 8) evening entertainment ? it?? a lot better than anything we have seen elsewhere and some was actually really good the bad things? br/>not much really , ok1) the transfer is not enjoyable ? 2) ummm ? nothingrecap essentials? take insect repellent and the good stuff2) take sun cream and lots of it ? it can get very hot3) think about taking a private taxi transfer4) take some flip flops ? the floor and sand will burn the soles of your feetjust as a fun thing? there are some flamingos and parrots by the pond at the front of the hotel ? be careful of the parrots , they will steal anything shiny including earrings , jewellery , watches etc and boy are they quick had the back of a guys earring within 2 seconds 
very much enjoyed my stay but check out was a nightmare i stayed at excellence punta cana from may 20- may 25 it was my husband and i first wedding anniversary hector , at the concierge desk was great he was already expecting us because we were announced by the entrance guard ( we drove in rather than the bus ) he placed us in a room with the pool view rather than mountain and hoped that we did not mind as far as the bumpy ride to the resort , i was already mentally prepared for the worst due to the reviews i had already read i was ready for an indiana jones type of adventure and was disappointed because it was not so bad i even got on a dune buggy excursion to try to experience the terrible bumps but it still was not as bumpy as i expected we were starving by the time we arrived and went straight for lunch at the grill the service and food was wonderful and when we arrived at our room , our luggage was already there along with fruits and a bottle of dominican don perignon ( this is an excellence joke , which you will only understand if you live the experience ) the entertainment team was excellent at and kept us busy if that was what we wished to do especially johanna , altagracia and the animator with the microphone in the daytime i cannot recall his name but he is very funny and very good also , domingo , the saxophone player is excellent and it only gets better because there is now a wonderful lady with the clarinet i never knew that a clarinet could be so soothing and romantic as far as the bug issue i was armed with my bug spray only to never have used it because i found none in my wonderful room ( room 1104, building 2) and never experienced any sand flies we had an excellent anniversary dinner at chez isabella and the staff was very attentive and professional when we arrived to our room after that perfect dinner , we arrived to a candle lit room with soft music and rose petal bubble bath and bed i was very impressed that management kept the date of our actual anniversary date and arranged for our dinner table and our bedroom room to be prepared in that special way for us the beach does have lots of waves but it only reminded me of a clean version of jones beach in long island , new york my only true complaint was during check out while my husband was away , arranging things with our luggage handler , the person that was assisting me with the check out gave me a very non - professional , raunchy comment because i am an american who married a local from the island and i visit him every 6 weeks he refereed about how hot and spicy my sex life is like when i arrive after 6 weeks i was embarrassed by his comments even his colleague reprimanded him and walked away a bit disgusted i simply reacted with a giggle for fear of popping him in the mouth and causing a scandal the same person then proceeds to tell me that i have a charge of three american dollars for a call that i did not make on may 21st , i had called the concierge from my room phone to get the number for american airlines she proceeded to give it to me but i did not dial it i have my blackberry and never used the room phone for outside calls , never even learnt how i was already so uncomfortable with this person that i just gave up and offered to pay the $ 3 00 put instead of billing me he insisted in getting a detailed telephone copy of my room which made my check out process even longer i just wanted to pay and run which eventually , i did because he came back convinced that i had made the call and so , i paid it life was great at excellence punta cana i would truly recommend it 
sand bugs eat you alive bring off spray bring bugspray to the beach and spray on you before you lay out we were bit alive and did not know it they call the ca not see um bugs ruined our entire stay i asked at the desk why they did not tell you about the sand bugs they just shrugged their shoulders and said they spray every day i do not know what they use but if you have to buy bugspray it was 12 
one word fabulous it was great the most relaxing vacation i have ever been on the food was great , the entertainment was great , the staff was great and the room was awsome the beds are a little hard , but i slept really well the ocean is a little rough it was balck flaged one day and the rest it was red flaged we got in the ocean everyday except the day it was black flaged it was so much fun to have some waves but most of the time we would go out far enough before the waves would break , it was about up to our shoulders overall the best vacation i have been on yet we did go to saona island with seavis tours which was great because there was only 8 of us and when we were at the island there were only a few other people we never saw a crowd i definately recommend seavis tours though because they only take 8-10 people on their tour 
good advice in this review you wo not want to leave view of building 2 from cascade pool 
good times overall , we had a great time at excellence this was my husband 's first time at an all inclusive , but my second i do not want to say it but i am feeling like if you 've been to one all - inclusive , you 've been to them all positives : great weather , awesome beach , polite people ( excluding some of the guests ) , good entertainment ( michael jackson , chris blizzard shows , to name a couple ) , good drinks and food ( though it did not agree with my husband and me for some reason ) , nice sports bar with fun games negatives : stomach cramps from the food , difficulty finding desired available seating and floating mats at pool , mosquitoes , sometimes difficulty understanding the people there who do not speak english advice : we brought about $100 in ones and that seemed more than enough , gave a dollar here and there for tips bring bug spray if you want a covered seated area in the pool reserve one with your towel or article of clothing by mid - morning do not be rude though and just grab one for the novelty of having one ( same with floating mats ) and then be gone all day only one morning we 'reserved ' a covered bed we were gone a few minutes and someone had the nerve to move our stuff and claim the bed as their own there were empty beds a couple down so we took one of those instead but not before removing the person 's stuff who stole our original bed and then someone else came along and took it - is not karma somethin ' the beach area , especially to the left when facing the ocean , has lots of covered areas to sit 
great staff we had a fabulous time too bad the weather did not cooperate still beautiful , relaxing , and a great staff we especially enjoyed alexandra who took us on a wild bike ride tour of part of the island 
having been to the caribbean on numerous occasions , it is quite clear that this is not the caribbean - it is in fact benidorm with coconuts we picked this resort due to the 5 star rating and 7 restaurants , 1 claiming to be gourmet the truth is as follows : 1 5 of the 7 restaurants are poor - food variety is poor there was no change in menu during our 2 week stay food was always luke warm at best there are no specialist chefs so the food is an attempt at , and a 'play ' on the cuisine it should be ( you get what you expect at macdonalds wine - although they have a comprehensive wine list , it is hardly ever available due to only having one wine expert on the complex as a result you get wine by the glass providing you do not mind a mix , as the staff ca not distinguish the difference between a chardonnay and a sauvignon or a shiraz and a merlot staff hospitality - ignorant , unfriendly except for those that dealt with guests on a daily basis such as barmen , waiting staff and reception , who were very nice - particularly the pool side barman , domingo saona island excursion - sold as tropical paradise for romantics , the reality a booze cruise with 1000 people made to dance military style to the macarena ( the mosquito bites were exceptional ) if you like good food , culture , and class , do not visit this resort , it does not meet any expectations i can only say that we have been to antigua , barbados , st lucia and all over europe , and this country , resort and hotel do not deliver it may impress some , but never again 
not worth your money - select another resort my fiancee and i just returned 4 days ago and we were not happy with our overall experience the ride from the airport to the resort was about 1 hour 1/2 between the road conditions and the bus driver , at one point we thought we would not arrive at the resort safely the driver had about a dozen passangers and he was driving in a unsafe manner punta cana does not have stop , yield or caution signs we also never saw traffic lights , therefore imagine how people drive ( drive at your own risk ) i wonder if the drivers in d have car insurance when we finally arrived at the resort , we were greeted with champagne the resort has to be complimented for the cleanliness and luxury of the premesis , but that is it if you are a beach bum do not select this resort in the 7 days that we were there only one day , you were allowed to enter the beach the rest of the days , they had the black flags prohibiting anyone to enter the beach the waters were rough and very choppy if you try to get a tan at the beach , even with bug repelent you will definately get sand flies bities they are very itchy , the itchiness last about 6 - 7 days also make sure you bring plenty of sun tan protectant lotion , if you forget you are looking to pay $20 00 uds at the resort pharmacy also bring tylenol and pepto bismol in case you need it can also be costly as far as the pools : you must come down to the pool section as early as 8am -10am the pool beds , chairs and especially the floats tend to be accupied quickly some people tend to place a towel on the beds and chairs and go have breakfast , they secure their beds , chairs and floats before their are no more available if you see their are no more towels available on the premesis , ask for them at the front desk ( they have a stash ) the facility entertainers are friendly and try their best to show the guest a great time ( juan carlos , franklin , joel and alexandria ) not too fond of wilkins ( arrogant individual ) food : if you select the resort for the food what you read is what you get no dominican food unless you make a complaint to the general manager of the resort miguel montanez so do not expect that because you are going to dominican republic you will enjoy the food , music and culture , that 's not the case at all every night the resort has entertainment theme nights while we were there they had , michael jackson , circus , magic , jazz , mc hammer and 70's/80's them nights we were not happy , we wanted to experience what dominican music is known for : perico ripiao , folk dance w/ colorful dresses , merengue and bachata if we wanted to see a michael jackson , cirque de soleil , magic , jazz , mc hammer ( which we do not hear about any more ) and 70's/80's show we would have not spend so much money traveling many miles away from home the food was nasty - especially the pizza ( not tasty like the ny pizza ) , gave some people an upset stomach the buffet breakfast at the toscano restaurant not a big selection and not very tasteful the lobster house - even worse lobsters extemely little and food not too good , the night we eat there we left still being hungary so we went to spice ( asian food ) which was greatttttt the best restaurants were spice and the grill the agave restaurant were busy , never had a chance to dine there because everytime we went they were at the max capacity of occupants allowed ( and since the resort does not require reservations , you were not able to make reservations ) room service : it 's 24 hrs but the the food is also nasty the mini - bar in the room keeps drinks at room temp we complained and were told the drinks are meant to be kept at room temp only never heard of such thing also beware of the scammers , if you go on the excusions and even the hotel vendors that come 2x 's a week will try to sell you things overpriced also beware of prieto tours rep johnny , he comes across to apparently be friendly and helpful but he is a scammer also we booked an excursion and he overcharged by credit card i was charged more than what he said if you are planning to go on any excursion it 's better to pay in cash also on the day we were leaving we were at the front desk waiting to check out as we were doing so the bus that was suppose to drive us to the airport arrived 5 minutes later the bus was gone we were on time and our luggage was already there but the bus did not wait the bell boy 's and us proceeded to johnnies desk and when the bell boy asked him to call the bus back which had just taken off , he refused we said it was our problem and that we should call a cab to drive us to the airport and pay $65 usd thank god their was a driver from another turist company picking up guests to drive them back to the airport , he heard what the problem was and he said do not worry he was going towards the airport and he would drive us at no charged 
love it my husband  i stay at this resort for 7 nights the hotel was amazing from the moment we entered the resort we were pleased the staff attended to our every needs all we needed to do was ask the food was good not excellent but that was ok the entertainment staff was wonderful they tried their best to keep the patrons entertained special thank you to all of them , ( alexandra , altagracia , yohana , ines and jilio ) in the theater area the ladies sara  yuli , the were wonderful they kept the drinks coming the resort is for adults only which was a big plus we loved every minute at this resort we shall return 
i hate it let me start by saying that the resort it self was beautiful it was very clean lets start with the long ride from airport to resort it was long about 1 hour and a half , the driver almost kill a dozen people riding in there mopeds on the way to the resort we then got greeted in the hotel lobby with cheap champaing the room was nice but full of bugs and the main problem i had of the room was the mini bar i call 3 times cause it was not working the drinks were hot , when i finally got someone to check it out i was told the mini bar was suppose to keep the drink in room temperature ( how the hell someone is gonna have a beer in room temp ) i complained a thousand times to the general manager mr montanez problem never got fixed the food was horrible , room service was the worse i rather eat white castle hamburgers if you pick this resort for the lobster house like i did do not is the worsed restaurant in the resort the only restaurant that 's good is the spice , and the grill by the way if you wanna eat at the agave keep waiting every night it was full so you really eat at 2 of the 8 restaurant the service was horrible in the restaurant it takes about 15 min to 30 min to get your order if you are lucky and the service by the pool or through out the resort is also horrible i think this resort is under staff i use the word horrible a lot cause thats the only word that can described my experience in the resort if you are a beach lover ( once again like my self ) do not waste the money go some were else the water are rough that they do not let you in the water 1 out of 6 days i spend there i got in the water but wait it gets better the sand had this animals call sand flies they will eat you up even if you have bug spray and they itch like hell and it last for 6 days very important do not trust jhonny he sells the extra activities in the resort he 's from prieto tours he is a crook i got charged on my credit card more then i wast told i 'm stil disputing the matter i bought a trip to saona from him and when i went on it the people in charge from prieto tours are all crooks they will push you to buy things example do not buy the mamajuana bring your own towels you will never find any this resort is not worth the money i pay it should not be call the excellence it should be call the horrible punta cana 
must go to excellence just returned from a 5 day stay at excellence for our 4 year anniversary it was truly excellente i have been studying the reviews on a daily basis before we left for d , so i feel i was ready for anything all of the bad reviews are just from americans who are used to the ritz carlton in palm springs , florida remember people , you are not in the us anymore first and formost i want to address the infamous drive from the airport to the resort while it is in fact a long drive , we enjoyed every minute of it you get to actually see the country for 45 minutes you see how people live , animals , and mountains in the distance i will , however recommend getting a private taxi at the airport for this drive we bypassed the bus full of people and went straight to a taxi stand all you say is excellence punta cana and agree on a price before you leave our price was $60 one way so $120 roundtrip and completely worth it we were on our way within 2 minutes of picking up our luggage we did not have to wait on the bus to load everyone on and also drop people off at their resorts along the way the roads are also not as bad as the reviews said again people , you are in a 3rd world country now to the resort it was beautiful we booked the excellence club oceanview room we enjoyed the club ammenities very much we were on the quiet end of the resort which was nice the room was very clean we never had issues with the air conditioning and never lost power our ocean view was not a complete oceanview but that was no big deal we spent all of our time at the beach anyways the staff is very friendly and some speak english very well and others not as well they are always cleaning the resort we were amazed at how much they cleaned the food was good yet again you have to realize that you are not in the us some food was different from what you would get here in the states but just keep an open mind and you will enjoy we liked every restaurant when you get to the point where you just want some american food go to the grill we ate steak and french fries and it was wonderful they even had a1 for all of us steak sauce lovers : ) as for the gorgeous ocean , yes it is very choppy and rough at times if it gets too rough there is always a life guard there that will personally come tell you to get out we loved walking down the beach to the right of the resort ( i think they said it 's only 300 ft ) and the water around the corner is like glass no waves what - so - ever we enjoyed this area of the beach everyday the only negative thing on the entire vacation was the pool float hogs they would get their floats and keep them at their chairs all day we saw one woman dragging 2 floats to her chairs so nobody could use them you either have to be like them and get to the pool early to stake your claim , or just give up and enjoy the pool floatless all in all we loved the excellence resort and would recommend it to any couple that wants a quiet romantic vacation we are in our mid twenties and enjoyed everything there were couples there from their early twenties to upper 60's just go with a positive attitude and you will have a wonderful time if you go looking for things wrong then you will probably be miserable 
okay time at the excellence my husband and i just returned from a stay at the excellence resort in punta cana may12- may18, 2008 for our 15h wedding anniversary it was nice but could have been much better have stayed at an all inclusive before and i hate to compare but the last one we stayed at was hands down much better first of all , the ride from the airport to the resort took an hour and a half after being in an airport since 7:30 am not getting in until 3:30 then having to ride in a bus for that long was too much i guess that put us off on the wrong foot next , we got into our room however it was not the room we expected we could not even see the ocean and we were under the assumption that we would have an ocean view room my husband complained and they did manage to move us the next day but the room we were put in was a smoking room and it really smelled moldy but we did see the ocean also , people do not seem like they are in too much of a hurry down there which is fine but when you wait for your luggage for almost 45 minutes when all you want to do is get out of the clothes you have travelled in all day that is a pain the food was nothing spectacular , we loved spice and even went back twice tipping did not seem to matter you got the same service whether you have a dollar or not i would suggest taking a large can of bug spray the mosquitos will eat you up we used a whole can the week luckily the last spray got us through the last night if you like swimming in the ocean , this is not the place to go it is the atlantic and it is very rough 4 out of 6 days the black flags were out as other reviews say , people grab chairs and huts very early and do not seem to be there much but we did not have much of a problem finding somewhere to sit i did not find the dominican people very friendly like most of the reviews said but i am sure some of them are unfortunately , we will not be going back to that place or that country for that matter overall , we had a good time and the weather was beautiful ohe highlight of the resort was the natural area there were the most beautiful peacocks and their babies we went there every day just to see them i will also say that the nightly entertainment was enjoyable as well my favorite was chris blizzard because you could actually understand him the people that worked there could not speak english very well at all and i know that it is their country but i would have thought they would at least be able to talk to you but i was wrong anyway , i am glad we went but i think it could have been alot better 
vey nice summaryi visited 8 days with my wife in may , 2008, garden view room this is a wonderful resort , and i would definitely recommend it if you read a review with negative here and there , pay it no mind this is a great place with good facilities , food , and service the only negative thing i would mention is that they close the beach for swimming periodically i think this resort gives perhaps the best overall value in the caribbean , and certainly the best of anywhere i??e been roomwe stayed in the garden view room ( which we always call the dumpster - view after seeing everything , i wouldn?? recommend upgrading to any of the excellence packages or swim up rooms the standard rooms are so nice , and you don?? get that much extra the room was quite nice it was spacious , tilled , and had a king bed with a jacuzzi no bugs , clean , in good working order and the room safe worked this is my pet peeve with resorts , when you can?? lock up your stuff we got cute towel animals , which my wife loved there was lots of complimentary toiletries and stuff maid service was good no problems with towels very clean , very large bar staff wanders around and takes drink orders both at the pool and the beach ( as well as delivering pizzas there are bars and bathrooms everywhere lots of shady spots they have pool rafts too plenty of beach towels which they leave out , you don?? sign for them the only problem in the pool area would be the usual : undisciplined fools ( guests ) running around trying to reserve things for the whole day , ridiculous foodthe food blew my wife and i away we are not hard to please , but still , the food is amazing first of all , they only close one or two restaurants during slow season , which they rotated , so you get to try them all i have been to resorts that close 2/3 of their resorts completely until busy season so on our trip they had two restaurants for breakfast one small one and a very large elegant buffet the set up was about the same for lunch these buffets are pretty awesome , like caviar etc then dinner is from five or six ethnic restaurants we thought all the food was very good , although here and there we talked to a couple less enthused about a particular restaurant barsthere are bars everywhere and the drinks are stiff they have a nice drink menu if you??e like me and can?? think of anything to order after a while beachthe beach is very pretty with lots of caba?as and hammocks and lounges as i mentioned above , servers come around and offer drinks and stuff the problem with the beach was they closed it for swimming about half the days we were there they do this because it gets rough there are calmer areas a short walk from the resorts , but to get to them you have to navigate some pushy hawkers ( vendors ) they are gorgeous and calm once you get there though enjoy your trip 
great adults only resort after weeks of doing research on the net my husband and i decided to go w/ excellence punta cana for our honeymoon spot even though it was just getting started as a 5 star luxury hotel for adults only - - it defenitely met our expectations the food was incredible ( many of the reviews we had read were ify about the food , but we new not to expect lobster  fillet mignon for dinner every nite , being that the d is still considered a 3rd world island so we were open minded  still loved the food ) this place went above  beyond trying to please their guests the locals were friendly  courteous  very open w/ the tourists the beach was great but the ocean a bit rough ( excellence is located on the northeasterly tip of the d therefore you get atlantic ocean  caribbean , surrounded by mountains so expect showers @ nite ( which make it very romantic )  beautifull sun  warm air during the day the views are breath taking we did a tour of the villages in boogies  loved it very sad though overall loved it  defenitely they get 5 star rating from us 
excellent at excellance we have just returned from the dominica republic and the excellance it was perfect the rooms were very clean and service was above and beyond anything we were expecting except for the lobster house the food an food service was 4 star most of all everyone spoke very good english and was very friendly the pool and beach are very clean , all restrooms are clean and shows were excellent the ride from the airport is 1- plus hours , but we got to see the local area and it went quickly well worth the ride we will be returning 
worth every penny my husband and i decided to take a well deserved rest for just the two of us - for the first time in almost 14 years our agent suggested the dominican republic , and then the excellence punta cana resort we 've stayed at our share of all - inclusives ( including sandals ) and were not impressed the excellence changed that and we ca not wait to try another one of their properties this time , we did not stay in the excellence club rooms , but i did not feel that we were missing out however , next time we may try them just to see if we were from start to finish - a completely worry - free and relaxing vacation we were picked up at the airport by a van cab with only one other couple we arrived within about 1 1/4 hours and were immediately greeted by a smartly uniformed bellhop , who relieved us of our bags while a lovely lady presented us each with a cool towel and glass of champagne ( yummy spanish bubbly - always complimentary ) it was about 11pm , so we were tired we opened the door to our suite  gasped to see it was about the size of our living and dining room together , with a jacuzzi bath  canopy bed - just like in the pictures clean , smelled great all the time only point in question - we received anywhere between 2 and 4 large towels each day - however , the mini fridge was well stocked and there was twice daily maid service ( turn down service at night ) too tired to venture out , yet famished , we ordered room service ( complimentary always - 24 hours - really ) and 30 minutes later we were eating absolutely delicious food a couple of times , we received slightly different things than we ordered , but whatever we got , it was wonderful and served with a smile the next day , we were astonished by the natural beauty of the beach and the gorgeous , well - kept grounds , complete with live flamingos  parrots the beach is quite private ( though technically federal property ) because there are really no other hotels nearby the water is rough - the first 4 days we used the boogie boards , but the last 3 the beach was closed for swimming as the waves were reaching heights of 10 feet or more about 30 feet away on one end of the beach , and a couple of hundred feet on the other , the water calmed significantly and if you wanted ocean swimming and some snorkelling , you had it a big thing - we always had large , clean beach towels at any time of the day ( complimentary ) and we always had a place to rest on the beach or poolside - whether it be one of the curtained , canopy beds , smaller settees , hammocks or comfy beach chairs no line ups for palapas or shade palm trees - there was plenty for all , and our hotel was at capacity the pool was amazing - big , clean , nice temperature there were always activities if you wished to join in the drinks were free flowing and amazing - premium liquors always available ( all complimentary again ) each day , there was a different featured cocktail to try - the bartenders were competing with each other all of the time to whip up the most delicious beverage the staff were incredibly well - trained and always available should you require anything at all , but not pesky and in - your - face everyone seemed to get along - they always had a lively banter going back and forth still providing me with excellent service it was a great feeling to see everyone having a good time while doing an amazing job hola altagracia ( at kafe cafe beach bar ) - que linda there were drinks staff on the beach , at the pool - everywhere pizzas  sandwiches were brought poolside every afternoon  barbeques and paella 's were abundant at lunch time on the beach there was minimal waiting for a seat in one of the several a la carte restaurants ( we had a one hour wait for the french restaurant one night , but we were able to walk away and have a drink at one of the bars while waiting - they give you a little disc that looks like a spaceship that lights up and buzzes when your table is ready ) every other night , we were seated right away the a la carte restaurants were great ( with the exception of the lobster house - not traditional lobsters , but prawns , and they are a bit mushy when cooked - i 'd miss this one for dinner if we went again ) all of the others were great the buffet was available for breakfast and lunch if you wanted hilario whips up a great smile and a terrific omelette we took tennis lessons with the resident pro rolando - he is truly amazing and patient i 've never really hit a ball and he had me competently rallying after the first hour there is a very minimal charge for the lesson and i 'm certain that i will be hard pressed to find anyone else as good as he is at instructing we met some other couples who took lessons as well ( they were players ) and they confirmed that fact even if you 've never thought of doing it - take a lesson from rolando i now have a good beginning from which to actually learn how to play , and it was really fun gym equipment was better than i 've ever seen - newer , neater and very clean definitely lacking in aerobics classes - they could really use a few trained instructors - the resort is so relaxed , that a great yoga class or dance aerobics class beachside would draw a big crowd the one yoga beach class i went to , one of the guests wound up teaching it on the very last day , both my husband and myself had slight cases of boogie belly , but 2 tabs of immodium advanced cured that immediately - do not have a clue what could have caused it and it was only a teeny speedbump in our perfect vacation you are not supposed to drink the tap water or brush your teeth with it , though it is purified i really ca not wait to go back to try another of the excellence resorts contact me with any questions 
rafalena rocks my girlfriend and i went for a week and absolutely had an amazing time everyone was very nice and helpful at all times the service was outstanding and could not have been better i would recommend the vacation for our friends be aware of the early risers when trying to get a good spot at the pool some people will claim their spot and not show up until noon my suggestion is ask someone around the seats and if they havent seen anyone , nicely set the towels aside and have a seat : ) the forecast may call for rain , but it is usually a short shower and nothing to worry about the activities organized by the staff were great and a lot of fun the horseback ride is worth the experience it 's included take a camera tipping is up to your discrestion , but i would recommend tipping if you appreciate the service they 'll give you change at the front desk the food variety is good spice was our favorite dinner spot toscana has a great lunch do not expect to be overly impressed with the food , but it is decent bug spray , with deet , is a must a lot of people there had 20 and 30 bug bites on their bodies we fortunately had that info and were prepared single or lesbian ladies , be aware of the male staff members that linger a little too long we had a few inappropriate moments overall everyone was great rafalena - the swim up bartender was the best she was supersweet and took good care of us we had a wonderful time and would recommend the resort to all kinds no kids running around and very relaxing with a fun nightlife take a camcorder is possible still pictures do not do the resort justice 
the only bad thing about excellence punta cana was leaving other reviews that may seem negative are way off base and going with a positive attitude makes all the difference in the world the people employed at the resort are friendly , hard - working and always willing to please the food was great , in my opinion ( and my husband 's ) , and the pizza by the pool was awesome for those of you who love beef , i would recommend the chateau briande ( sp ) at chez isabelle i recommend going to dinner between 6:00 and 6:30 in order to get in right away drinks are also top notch and flow freely ( thanks juan and felix the drink of the day is always interesting to try some people have complained about the beds , but from two people who have back issues , we found them a bit firm , but fine it 's not like you have to live there and sleep on them forever our room was beautiful (3rd floor with an ocean view and vaulted ceilings ) and always cleaned within a reasonable amount of time if there is something you need , just write a note and they will get it for you the resort grounds are downright gorgeous and not so huge that walking was a pain we only had rain showers twice during the week and they only lasted 10 minutes each in the end , i would definitely go to excellence punta cana again and may seemed to be the perfect time because the resort was not full and we did not really have to wait in line for anything just some advice : when you pack , take a good look at your suitcase and then take half of your clothes out because you will likely be on the beach or in the pool all week also , put your sunscreen in your bag and then take twice as much ( it cost us $23 00 for a medium sized bottle on the resort take lots of one dollar bills for tips that are most certainly deserved this trip was definitley a do - over 
not a 5* resort my partner and i stayed at this resort for 2 weeks for my birthday the first room we were given ( block 14) was tired with a leak which dripped through the fan , chipped tiling in the shower and the drying line in the shower fell off when touched i slipped on the water which had dripped through the ceiling fan jarring my back we complained about the room and the next day were moved to a room in block 8 which was in a much better condition and had obviously been renovated the phone did not work however one couple who were on our flight with the same travel agent were moved 3 times due to various problems one problem ( they showed us the photographs ) was black water comming out of the hot water taps we were informed by other guests ( note not by the hotel or travel agent rep ) that 2 people had drowned in the sea 2 weeks prior to our arrival due the the very strong under currents the sea was dangerous and i would advise not to go above knee deep in the sea the cleanliness of the pool side toilets left a lot to be desired and the ladies often had no toilet papaer and for most of our stay two of the cubicles were out of order for two days there was an absence of hot water in the room for the first week the service at and around the bars was very poor and on occasions two bars were being tended by one barman , and insufficient waiters/waitresses serving at the seating areas the staffing levels increased drastically for the second week and the service improved ordering food was a lottery and in the same resteraunt on different evenings we ordered the same meal which was totally different one lunch time i ordered chicken only to be served steak kebab room service for breakfast was aslo interesting having ordered fruit , pancakes with maple syrup and bucks fizz ( it was my birthday ) , what arrived was the fruit , large bowl of maple syrup and bucks fizz no pancakes there are however some good points at the resort and the one that stands out is the entertainment dominico and carlos were great and the shows entertaining the location and surroundings were also good in conclusion i would not reccomend this hotel and would not return not a patch on the aventura spa palace in mexico and the 4* riu bachatta is superior to this hotel for half the price 
i stayed at the excellence punta cana for 5 nights of nothing but luxury and decadence the grounds are not only lovely but spotless after arriving from the airport , you are greeted with some warm hand towels and a flute of champagne the rooms are large with a whirlpool tub , a balcony with a table , hammock and the pool right at your feet with so many restaurant choices , you ca not go wrong with a meal it is so nice not to have limitations with the amount of times you wish you to dine in a restaurant and it is quite a treat not to have to make reservations i chose the excellence package which allows you access to a concierge club with snacks and drinks at your disposable most of the day the staff was professional , courteous and very willing to serve the animation group was awesome in getting people involved with activities and games joel , franklin and juancarlos went above and beyond just to ensure everyone had a great time i will be returning here in august and recommend it highly keep up the good work excellence 
this was our first trip to the dominican republic and to an excellence resort and i think we definitely chose wisely as others have written , the drive from the airport is horrible but you do get to see some of the countryside and realize what it is like outside of the resort that is all the good i can say we upgraded to the excellence club upon arrival and while it was nice , would not do again - not really worth the extra money to us the grounds of this resort are impeccable , the drinks always flowing and the food for the most part very good highly recommend ordering room service for breakfast - tasted better than in the restaurants as for the dinners , yes , if you go after 7:30 you usually have to wait but well worth it at chez isabelle and toscana the entertainment team , especially alexandra and ines , the crazy hair lady and dance teacher were great make sure to look them up when you are there - they are in the disco at night too the disco is small but fun , casino very small and sports bar fun place to watch sporting events everyone on the resort is extremely friendly and we were fortunate to meet a really nice couple ( hopefully now lifetime friends ) that we plan on traveling with to another excellence resort next spring take bug spray - the bugs are bad at night but nothing that ca not be dealt with this resort is first class all the way and i ca not imagine going there and not having a memorable time 
excellence is excellent , but not quite perfect my girlfriend and i stayed at excellence for 7 nights at the end of april/ beginning of may 2008 and had a terrific time i am so surprised at some of the bad reviews , i definitely would not let them stop you from going to this beautiful , well kept , clean resort i will break things down in categories and try not to be too repetitious of the things already said on this site arrival - the airport arrival was smooth , our bags were out quickly and we found our pre - arranged ground transportation with little difficulty the trip from the airport for us was nowhere near as bad as some people have stated we were concerned having read some of the reviews ahead of time so we paid a little extra for private transportation and it was great the trip took about 45 minutes and other than a couple of sections of below average roads the ride was fine check - in at the hotel was also smooth and noone even tried to get us to upgrade to the excellence club our junior suite swim up room was ready upon arrival room - our room was clean and in good condition we did not lose power or water at all in our room in building 4, though our neighbor had some problems with fuses blowing when using the hair dryer our a/c worked very well the maid service was fine , the room was cleaned by 3 pm or so each day , it varied , and with the exception of our first night we received turn down service although we left tips almost every night we received no towel animals or drawn bath as others have reported , only a few flower petals on a couple of occasssions there was a minor problem with the phone not getting a dial tone which was adressed quickly pool/beach - absolutely beautiful , clean and well kept the surf can be a little rough but if you have gone to the beaches in the northeast it is not much worse than that you just need to be careful and observe the flags which tell you the conditions there were plenty of beach chairs , hammocks and beds available , it was not a problem at all , and there always seemed to be plenty of towels available the main pool is huge and wonderful to just float in the swim up bar area was a little noisy thanks mostly to some obnoxious ny people ( i can say that since i am from there lol ) , but there is plenty of room to find some quite space the cascade pool is usually more quiet with less activity and less people the pool and beach service is good with drink service and pizzas brought around food/bar - the breakfast and lunch buffets were good , the choices were extensive so you should be able to find something to suit your taste the dinners were a bit uneven the appetizers tended to be the best part of the meal for us with the entrees a hit or miss event sometimes due to miscommunications what you order is not always what you get , this happened to us on a couple of occassions , but it is not worth getting upset about , just roll with it , after all you are on vacation our favorite dinner meal from beginning to end was at barcelona the sushi and sashimi at spice was fresh the drinks are plentiful and readily available wherever you are in the resort definitely try the mamjuana , it is a rum and honey drink service - the service was really good , the staff try very hard and for the most part succeed others have noted that they received better service upon tipping , we tipped quite extensively but seemed to receive the same service as those who did not seem to tip we did not mind tipping though , as the staff work very hard and very long hours and do not make much money we did order room service three times , one time it did not come we had ordered breakfast the night before but it never came and when i called they had no record of the order the other two times the dinners we ordered came in a reasonable amount of time we also asked for a wake up call which never came , not sure if there was a problem with the phone or the call was never made , but the front desk staff were very apologetic about it we took one excursion which i would not recommend we had signed up for the monster truck safari but without our knowledge were switched to the funny monster safari which had a different itinerary we were not told about the switch ahead of time and had no way of knowing since we were picked up for the trip in an unmarked truck entertainment/activities - there is plenty to do if that is your choice or you can choose to just relax there are shows every night , although we did not make it to any of them , all that lounging around can be pretty tiring we did hear the sax player and he was great i would definitely recommend this resort based on our experience we were already talking about returning again while we were still there 
5 star and more my new wife and i just spent 5 days here on our honeymoon this was the best vacation either of us have ever been on excellence is a place where you can lay low , have a romantic evening , or party like a rock star first let me start w/ a tip , when you arrive at the airport do not let any of they pushy luggage guys in white shirts push you around keep a hold on your bag and walk past them and simply find a taxi stand make sure it is a taxi and not a bus you can get a private taxi nonstop to excellence for $60 and this is the way to go for sure the hotel will set you up w/ a cab for another $60 to return to the airport after you arrive @ excellence you do not have to worry about anything else you are greated w/ a cold towel and a glass of champagne when you arrive @ the lobby our room ( a swim up suite ) was 10 ft from the pool w/ a nice king size bed ( a little firm ) , a beautiful tiled bath and shower area , a huge whirlpool bath ( easily big enough for 2) , and a fully stocked mini bar the beach area is very nice and well maintained however the surf is a little rough in front of the resort you can walk just off property a little and find some calmer water they play volleyball each day @ the beach @ 11am and 4 pm and it is a blast they also have an outdoor kitchen and cook something good out there everyday around 1 so you do not even have to leave the beach there is also a waiter that comes around the beach and takes drink orders it 's awesome the pools are also great one is a waterfall pool which we did not get in the other is a huge pool that meanders through the property and has a swim up bar around the pool there are plenty of chairs w/ cushions and even beds ( some covered and some not ) all of the meals we had were above average and a few of them ( mediterranean and french ) were both amazing the lunches and breakfasts are also above average we did not have a bad mean the whole time and the only place we did not eat was the asian rest make it a point to walk across from the lobby across the street to the botanical garden alot of people miss this but there is alot of wildlife and it is beautiful one more tip , if you get a message go ahead and do it inside the spa my wife and i tried a romantic couples message on the beach , however the mosquitos got so bad that we had to get off the tables and put our clothes on the resort was very accomodating and offered another message free of charge they also have a sports bar w/ pool , ping pong , and foosball they have tennis courts , horseback riding ( which is very cool ) , and they have an open air theatre with a different show each night overall i highly recommend this place as it is clean , the food is awesome , and the service is very friendly and personable and make sure to try the drink sammy sosa that was my wife 's favorite 
if you like to relax have a drink here and there or if you like to party and have a lot to drink here and there this is the place this was our first time to an all inclusive resort and we loved it nothing is ever going to be perfect at a hotel or resort because if it is not the bed it is something else when we arrived at the hotel after an hour and a half ride from the punta cana airport we were greeted with champagne and a very helpful front desk they all do not speak english , but than again we are in their country the english that the people that you will be interracting with is good along with their italian , french , german , and i am sure other languages that they learn yes , a few of the employes spoke more than one language but if you can speak spanish that you learned in eigth grade you can get by easily the room that we stayed in was a hotel room , it was on the third level so we had vaulted ceilings the jetted tub was great , the shower fit both me and my wife the water pressure was not bad there were enough towels and 2 robes as well as slippers in the room the fridge was stocked with their domestic beer and juices as well as bottled water and was restocked when it was depleted with the respective drinks there was no charge for the mini bar we used room service and it was a little slow and one night our order was never put in and when we called they were very apologitic and had the new order up in 30 min the food , we thought , was good and great it just depended on what we ordered it was not the best i have had , but than again the best that i have had i also had to pay for every time i ate it we spent a lot of time at the resort either on the beach or at the pool the drinks were great and the atmosphere was great i kind of compare it to a cruise which i have been on 2, but instead of sailing you are on land and your alcohol is included again which we loved i can go on and on but if you would like to know more feel free to ask on a scale of 5 stars i give this a 4 
great hotel - but beware the sea off this particular hotel 's beach we stayed at this hotel for christmas and new year 2007/8 the hotel was fine and the food was good the accommodation was good although there were a few small maintenance issues wth our room which took a while to resolve however , my main reason for writing this review is to warn people of the sea off this hotel 's beach two people drowned during one incident while we were there an absolute tragedy but there are vicious under currents/ rip tides which proved too strong for these two poor men there are no lifeguards on the beach , no rescue boat and , despite putting out red flags every day , people still went in the water we did , but only up to our knees after this dreadful tragedy happened we went here as we love to swim in the sea but nowhere were we pre - warned that this beach was so dangerous we may have chosen to go elsewhere had we known that the sea was so rough you are not bothered about swimming in the sea then this is a lovely place and a beautiful hotel ( although beware the journey to the hotel - the roads are dreadful ) the hotel and swimming pools were clean and bright , the beach was beautiful and the staff were all very politeand friendly the activity team were also very lively and fun 
" excellante " we just arrived home and already miss the people at excellence first was lisbeth - although the sun was shining every morning nothing could outshine the smile we got every morning from this wonderful girl as she escorted us to our breakfast table sara  ines were so nice to be around we would often try to sit where sara was serving drinks ines was like the ambassador of fun and was everywhere making sure you were having a good time adan - i was sick and was having dinner w/ my husband in toscana and adan ran across the resort to find me a ginger ale - and then made sure it was kept cold the entire time i was there jose - ( cafe kafe ) he was our favorite bartender at the resort he is one of the reason s we will return to excellence alot of what we loved about him is charm and you cant help to return night after night to see what was going on at cafe kafe the night jose did not work - we counted 36 people come and ask where jose was there were so many others that helped equally but some stood out more than others im not going to get too specific - food was good to excellent - it was the best you can get in the dominican if you cant find a resturaunt you like at excellence - stay home and eat your mama 's cooking i loved the shows - someone said they were cheesy but its not broadway i loved the attention to detail and the thought the entertainers put into the shows the room we had was awesome and the view was excellent the excellent service surpasses any minor imperfections that you may find at this resort the staff is willing to accomadate you - but you have to let them do their job the ride from the airport was no differant than driving in chicago after the snow has melted lots of traffic and potholes and people not paying attention not a big deal look out the window absorb the culture and its people it will make you appreciate the resort much more my advice is : to enjoy everything the resort has to offer/get the daily newsletter/a dollar tip goes a long way/get towels , mats and chairs early/visit jose at cafe kafe ( tell him tonia said hola ) 
relaxing and romantic vacation my girlfriend and i are both around 30 i booked the trip through vacation express and i booked the airfare separate through spirit i saved $1,000 by doing this vacation express was less expensive compared to orbitz and expedia we were in punta cana from april 17-24 the trip was absolutely awesome and we wish we had book for 10 days i will go into detail about the resort first , the ride from the punta cana airport is bumpy and a little wild the drivers definitely have their own style i had been to punta cana before and i rode the bus to the resort the bus ride is horrible , because you have to wait for everyone to get on the bus before leaving the airport then the bus will make two or three stops at other resorts so for this trip , i knew there was no way i was riding the bus we pre - booked online with dominican airport transfers it cost a few extra dollars , but it is definitely worth it we landed at the airport at 1:05 p on thursday , april 17 we got our luggage and was in the car on our way to the resort at 1:30 we arrived at the resort at 2:15 p other people staying at the resort spoke of the hour wait at the airport before leaving and then the 1 hour and 30 min ride to the resort because of the stops next , the hotel staff was exceptional the people worked very hard to make sure everyone was confortable tips are not required , but if you ca not afford to tip these people then stay at home there are people there that do not tip and these are the people that complain about everything you are in a 3rd world country this is not a place to go for neiman marcus or saks fifth avenue shopping if you are looking to relax and enjoy your lover this is the place no children being around makes for a wonderful , peaceful , relaxing vacation we got a masters suite with pool view i am definitely glad we got a masters suite over a junior suite the difference between the rooms is there is a double balcony with the masters suite and there is also a separate room from the bedroom we did not spend a lot of time in the room during the day sitting , but the extra space was very nice the rooms are not 5 star , but the rooms are very nice and very clean housekeeping did an excellent job of keeping the rooms very neat the lady would always fold our clothes and was in the room once in the morning and once in the evening the power did go out a couple of times while we were there again this is part of life in the dominican republic it was only out for twenty minutes each time the food is not horrible like some say it is i live in atlanta , georgia my girlfriend and i eat at very nice restaurants regularly like mortons of chicago , prime , two urban licks , and etc again you have to be open to realizing you are in another country the food is not exceptional , but it is not horrible either the best restaurant is the french there was a wait usually every night who cares if there is a wait have an extra cocktail and relax there are always people that forget that dominican time is slow the steakhouse is good , but remember to ask the server to put the sauce on the side the breakfast buffet is o breakfast was my least favorite meal the lobster house breakfast was good the lunch buffet is very good and it changes everyday the lobster house for dinner was probably the worst restaurant the lobsters are constantly undercooked becuase they grill them if the lobsters are cooked correctly , they are very good people forget that the lobsters served in punta cana are warm water lobsters most people are used to eating cold water lobster there is a difference the pizza served by the pool is very good two nights while we were there , special dinners were cooked on the beach these meals were very good featuring some dominican specialties the mexican restaurant was o the best thing in the mexican place is the fajitas the asian restaurant was very good we did not eat at the italian restaurant or order room servicethe entertainment was very good some nights and not so good other nights the michael jackson show is really good i am not a fan of michael jackson , but the entertainers really put on a show the guy that plays michael jackson plays at several resorts he is almost like a local celebrity he arrives in a motor home and puts on an excellent show the karoke night was also very entertaining the disco was fun some nights while we were there we just like to chill so we never minded this the pool is exceptional we met a lot of couples at the pool that will probably be lifelong friends we are actually going to see four couples we met from ohio over the summer the pool bar has really good service do not forget to bring some money to the pool the service is exceptional with very good name brands available 
overall disappointed we stayed here 3 days having spent 3 days previously at the paradisius palma real which is admittedly more expensive but the excellence in comparison is not good value for money we had mixed feelings about the resort but would not go back and overall didn?? like it firstly , what we did like were : the beach , the gym ( really nice ) and the generally very friendly staff ( although not always so helpful in the face of problems ) this comes across however as an all in resort trying to save money - it saves money on the quality and range of the food , the quality of the drinks and the resort feels like it 's seen better days also during the day in the resort is not a fun lively place and a proportion of the other guests looked bored and not really enjoying themselves part of this we put down to the layout of the resort , and its sombre nature i think the biggest disappointment was the food however , to such an extent that we were happy to skip meals and had little enthusiasm for what was on offer even though we were there just for 3 days when you are in an all in resort which no other alternative this is a problem the oil which the breakfast is cooked in has a very unpleasant taste other isolated points which might help give a picture of the resort - - we had problems with black water in the bath we were eventually moved into rooms prepared for honey mooners by mistake and were pleased we were not there on honeymoon - the way the room is prepared for honeymooners is very cheap and cheerful - a cheap bottle of sparkling wine , a few petals and a plate of unexciting fruit including a pear which was never going to ripen no matter how hot it got - the inclusive unmotorised watersports are poor , consisting of just one of everything , and a strong emphasisi on selling other trips - punta cana is used in hotel names very liberally for the whole of the coast this hotel along with a couple of others is nowhere near anywhere else being a very long way up the coast to the north this was very apparent as we were independent and couldn?? drive as quickly as say a taxi who would know where the pot holes and speed bumps are even for him it would represent a very long transfer dress code for the restaurants regarding shoes is absurd - women can wear beach shoes/ flip flops but men ca not wear very smart ( although ) open shoes the staff are not flexible on this point put your running shoes on which will look very unsmart and you??l be fine however 
may be 3 stars spent a week there the food was alright in the seafood restierant our food was taken away before we where done 'our room was changed 3 times told us we where given the wrong room the staff seemed like it was more important to play basesball on beach instesd of the geust laying on the beach my wife and another woman was hit by the balls 
had fun in spite of the weather my husband just returned from excellence punta cana and while we had a great time , something was missing i suppose it was because the clouds that rolled in from behind the mountains daily around noon causing the rest of the day to be cloudy with some rain and wind but let me tell you about the hotel and the area yes , the ride from the airport is as everyone describes it about an hour , the drivers drive fast , slalom around the potholes , barely skirt around cyclists and you hang on for dear life quite a hair raising experience we took a taxi instead of the bus that the travel agent arranged you can fore go the transfer and the hotel will send a car for you it 's $60 each way upon arriving at the hotel , you get the wash cloth and a class of champagne the lobby is very nice and airy , clean , and a nice place to hang when it rains check in was simple and fast the room was in building 1 the buildings are pastel colored and 3 storied , quaint and very clean and well maintained building 1 was nice for us , it was near the cascade pool , tennis courts and the street with the quaint stores , pond with flamingos , and a jogging path that we did not find until the last day we had an oceanfront room , but the buildings are set so far back from the ocean and the foliage is so high , that we could not see the ocean but that did not matter the room was spacious and we had a huge jacuzzi unfortunately maid service was irregular they did not clean the room sometimes til 5 pm one day it was 7pm we did get turn down service daily , but we did have to remind them on 1 occasion plenty of towels and the shampoo is great enough spce to put you clothes and there is a room safe the beach was nice if you are used to swimming at the new jersey shore my husband loved it , but i had to walk to the right several hundred yards where there is a coral reef that blocks the waves there it is wonderful the water is warm and soo clear it is warm and clear by the hotel as well but i do not like the waves and the red flags were up daily the beach is a golden sand , not white as other islands that we go to but the beach is free from coral and seaweed the beach goes on for miles with palm trees lining the coast it was truly great wish the sun was out more no trouble getting a palapa at the beach and plenty of towels the pool is the longest that i have ever seen it takes about 15 minutes to swim it 's length it 's like a lazy river we did not spend much time there though since we are beach people and it was difficult to get shade there however in the afternoons we spent time at the cascde pool i truly loved it the health club is super - - all new we did the bike tour with lucas twice and it was safe and the countryside is spectacular with horses , cows and mountains the food was mediocre being from ny we hoped it was better , but all the reviews that we read panned the food so our expectations were not too high breakfast and lunch at the toscana is perfect lots of great tasting food and much variety it was dinner that was a problem it was difficult to get in most restaurants if you did not get there by 7, which we never did it seemed like you were lucky to get a good meal it was all edible , but not really great except the asian restaurant spice where everything i had was tasty when you got hungry during the day , they came around with pizzas which were really good the drinks were good , you can taste the alcohol and the local beer was fine too the excursion to saona island was not worth the 4 hour bus/boats ride to get there but it was sunny all day so that was good the day we wanted to go on the caribean festival trip , it poured and was cold even the guide that greeted us at the bus had on pants and a sweatshirt we told them that we wanted to go back to the hotel and that was not a problem and we got a refund we felt that if we ever go back , we would do the catalina tour - - it goes to an island and has diving and snorkling the evening entertainment was fine , rather enjoyable and passed the time before the 10pm entertainment they have karoke , and other fun ice breakers we also had fun at the casino each evening the intenet is $5 for 20 minutes at the internet cafe the sevice was wonderful all the waiters and waitresses are so lovely and aim to please knowing some spanish is also helpful all in all we had a lovely vacation , but we had hoped the sun would have shined more 
great time , but just got back saturday night from an 8 day vacation to excellence we traveled with 3 other couples and have been anxiously waiting this trip for months it was a great time , but there were some things missing preventing this from being 5 star it is a beautiful hotel , beautiful beach and pool , however in my room the ceiling above the shower was caving in , and i could see all of the piping and tubes up there kinda creeped me out , like someone was up there watching me shower the shower also had mold in it cleaning service didnt come until around 5 or 6pm every night which was very annoying since they wanted to come in right in the middle of us getting ready for dinner we had to grab extra towels from the beach knowing that we might not have clean towels later on room service always took about an hour an a half , even just to bring a hamburger we kept losing power for long periods of time the room clocks were always off whenever i went to blowdry my hair , the fuse blew out the power in the whole room the pool area is beautiful and relaxing , and the pool activities are fun if you chose to participate the entertainment staff was great it was annoying to wake up as early as 8am and not be able to find a chair because they were reserved sometimes we just moved peoples towels anyway : ) also , pool floats are like gold there , people scoop those up by 7am , and keep them by their reserved chairs the pool def needs a little buffettarea where you can grab a quick bite , so you dot always have to go inside for lunch this was one thing that annoyed me the most about my stay here a pizza guy does come around at 3pm , but y then i had already eaten inside and couldnt wait also , i rarely ever saw a waiter taking drink orders most of the time we had to go to the cafe bar to get our own i happened to think that the food was great at all of the restaurants except toscana i ordered steak figuring it was a safe choice and it was inedible i loved the lobster house for breakfast and the grill for lunch they have unbelievable french fries , onion rings , chicken sandwiches and caesar salads the buffet breakfast and lunch was ok for a quick bite , but i couldnt really find anything i liked spice and chez isabelle were amazing best french onion soup and chateaubriand i have ever had the lobster house wasnt too bad , but the grill was one of out favorites for dinner the fliet mignon was great its funny though , because although we enjoyed the food , we all had serious stomach issues and were living off of bottles of maalox we all did the dunebuggy tour and it was great , except for them stopping everywhere wanted you to buy jewelry and other souvenirs we actually had way to much fun , and got kicked off of the tour at the end for being too rowdy and not following the tour guide it was awesome you get incredibly muddy , like tidal waves of mud , , and had to throw out all of our clothes that we had worn there was no saving them the club was also a lot of fun , , it was pretty empty all of the time , but there were 8 of us , so we made our own fun overall , it was a great trip but they really need to improve their service and maintenance our honeymoon at le blanc in cancun last august blows this place away in all areas it was hard because my husband and i kept comparing it to le blanc and there clearly is no comparison excellence is just a 4 star resort with poor service , at le blanc we never had to leave our chair for anything 
excellence was excellente this resort was fantastic our room was clean , with a great view we had excellent service from everyone like carlos helping us with our bags , and robert and maria in the excellence club pablo at the bar between agave and chez isabelle was the magic margarita maker we had a slight issue with air conditioning day 2 or so , but the staff worked quickly to get us fixed , sending maintenance while we were at the pool we were impressed with the speed with which our issue was addressed we truly enjoyed every meal breakfast at toscana , lunch mostly at the grill dinner at chez isabelle was one of the best pork loins i have ever had the mixed grill for dinner at the grille was a huge portion of different steak , pork , and chicken cuts my carnivore fiance was quite pleased toscana had pasta carbonara that was to die for room service was farily timely , and come on people , you are on vacation 35 minutes is not a long time the grouper at spice was fantastic , as was the duck we enjoyed this vacation right after we got engaged , and i found this to be the perfect romantic getaway 
my husband and i just got back from a 6 night stay we absolutely loved it the moment we pulled up to the resort we fell in love we stayed in the excellence club where we met so many nice couples of all different ages we had a beautiful oceanview room with a mini bar that was like your own bar at home our bed was a little to firm for me and my husband but none the less quite comfortable our bar person gladly changed what my husband and i did not want stocked in the bar with everything that we did want to drink we tipped him generously our first day and he was our friend for the week always asking us if we needed anything even after he did his daily room check i have read the reviews regarding the food at the resort i am very happy to say that i enjoyed every meal that i had toscana 's was excellent , the breakfast at this place is phenominal the grill was good , but my favorite would have to be chez isabelle everyday , i tried the excellence drink of the day do not let a day go by without trying each drink of the day my favorite drink of the day was called hot summer i loved it so much i made sure i brought home the recipe with me this resort was immaculately kept the pool was beautiful every staff member that you passed greeted you if you are looking for inexpensive gifts to bring home , to the right of the resort is the local vendors call wal - mart they are located on the beach go see nancy and charie the first store on the beach no pressure to buy anything but you will buy something , you cannot help it i purchased several paintings and masks along with some other gifts i highly recommend this resort to anyone who is looking for serenity i would to say that i did not like the hour ride to and from the airport but , it was worth it 
an a+ vacation my wife and i just recently retured from a 5 night stay at the excellence resort in punta cana , dominican republic i was not going to write a review but i feel i must address some of the unfair comments that i had read on tripadvisor prior to our vacation my credentials are simple i have stayed at dozens of all - inclusive resorts throughout mexico and the carribean and have gone on a few cruises entry into the country : very easy with little or no hassle there is a $10 entry fee per person they will give you an entry card then a person will collect it a few steps away ride to the resort : excellence is the farthest resort from the airport we went directly to the resort with no other stops and it took at least an hour the roads are not nearly as bad as most claim and the driver was very courteous check - in : check - in was also a breeze it was very easy to comunicate with the front desk as most spoke good english in my opinion there is no reason to upgrade rooms all the rooms i saw were very nice and spotless it upset me that some reviewers took pictures of small rust spots on the sink and showers room : very nice but more important to me it was spotless it had all the ammenities we needed including a hairdryer that actually dried your hair we are big tippers and left the maid $5 and a small gift every day food : here is where i have my biggest issues with some of the past reviewers the excuetive chef is a marvelous german man who is very concerned with the quality of the food he presents points to consider : - he supervises the cooking of breakfast , lunch , and dinner for thousands of people each day he cooks for all nationalities each with a pallet of their own incorporates into his meals all the local fruits , vegetables , and items that are grown or raised locally he has 7 different theme restaurants that he is in charge of - he is married to his job ( certainly by his own choice ) my wife and many others we had spoken to thought this food was the best we had ever experienced at an all - inclusive resort the quality and variety of the food is just amazing activities : many to choose from but we chose only to do the horseback riding it was a blast the activity people work very hard to get you involved our favorites were alexandria and inez , 2 people we will never forget everything else : the grounds , pool , service , etc was pretty much the way other travelors described it but there is one more thing i would like to mention we had the opportunity to meet and visit with one of the workers carlos manuel he was one of the most impressive young men i have ever met everyone should be as happy each day as carlos and have the insights on life that he has carlos it was a pleasure to meet you and i would be honored to have a son like you hola to everyone at the excellence , love , jose and beckey 
our group of 12 just got back yesterday ( aged 30-54) we give a lot of high marks in most areas and this review is based on comments received from all 12 of us great beach - the best we 've been to so far in a cove , and not over - crowded super waves , but a calm cove located just beyond the resort property where you could go snorkelling went sailing one day , but they do not go out unless conditions are just right great place to take a siesta had a number of wicker framed beds with full sized mattresses to relax on by the pool and the beach , some covered for shade very nice pools - long and windy and not over - crowded as well , even though facility was at full capacity very nice rooms - only issue is shower could be bigger ( about 3 x 3 ft clean , well maintained , big flat screen tv with some of the more popular us networks one adult channel (21) , which is too raw mini - bar is well stocked with bud , bud - lite , presidente beers , bottled water , sprite , fanta orange soda , diet coke , v -8, and pinapple juice top brand liquors provided and you can state your preferences service was excellent , but a lot of the staff spoke very limited english for a resort that had over 80% english speaking clients while we were there we highly recommend excellence club , especially if traveling with a group that gave us private concierge service , which also provided us with a private lounge where our group met almost every morning for breakfast , but always in the evening before going out to eat the lounge had 3 computers with internet service available at no extra charge we even had a small surprise birthday party where the concierge , provided balloons , posters , terrific chocolate cake and even had a mexican trio from the local restaurant come sing 3 songs for the event very nice touch i tipped here more than at other resorts , because the service was that good a condensed version of the miami herald was provided to our room daily getting there was longer than expected - we took our travel package transport and there were a number of stops made on the way there , one beer stop where we got 22 ounce or 32 ounce presidentes then 3 stops at different resorts , so over 2 hrs to get there on the way back , one and a half hours with one stop at dreams resort bars were all very good with excellent service and drinks , again all top brands available for our group , tangueray , bailey 's , absolut and bud lite bars also were not over - crowded they always had a tropical drink of the day servers ordered and delivered drinks to you at the beach and in the pool area nightly entertainment was one of the best we 've experienced , nice open auditorium with good sound system good music and dancing acts chris blizzard performed our last evening there and was a very good singer who got good crowd participation the restaurants overall are good , but not great we did have a number of very good meals , but we 've had better overall food at other resorts italian and mediterranean restaurants had very good fish and provided a very good variety for breakfast and lunch grilled food there is not char grilled , it 's flat grilled , even for steaks fillet mignon at the grill is very good , but not always cooked as ordered other steaks were thin they tended to over cook steak light gravys , mashed potatos and french fries were top shelf french restaurant was popular and only sat 50 people , so if you are not in line by 6pm , you have a 2 hr wait no lines at any other restaurant we all had a very good meal at the oriental restaurant it was tough to get 12 people to sit together , but they did their best to place us close to each other , usually 6 and 6 about 5 or 6 of us got sick near the end of our stay from the food or water , but we could not isolate the cause we spoke with a few other guests that had the same problem the spa was very good and reasonably priced , from stone therapy to facials in summary , this is a very , very nice resort with a lot of excellent amenities and services adults only was also a big plus for us most adults came as couples , but a few came as friends or sisters there were a number of honeymooners there , but we did not witness any weddings on site like other resorts had it not been for the number of people who got sick in our group (12-24 hour intestinal problem ) and had the food compared to the other resorts we 've been to ( sandals and moon palace ) , we would have rated this a definite 5 
bravo to franklin 's spoanish lesson overall we had a good experience at excellence as stated in other reviews there was a problem getting towels and chairs at the pool there was also a communication problem with some of the housekeeping staff when requesting towels , and erratic times for making up the room the property was beautiful and well maintained franklin from the entertainment team gave daily lessons in spanish and was truly helpful , giving out handouts and working individually with you to help you learn the restaurants were ok we had several annoying blackouts during the week we were there excellence is good for a relaxing week and for the carribean is one of the nicer places we 've been to 
very nice for a quiet vacation we just returned from a week long stay at excellence overall it was very nice we may go back but it was not , imho , one of those vacations where you immediately say that you just have to return it was very nice , but just too laid back i think i saw more books being read than on any other vacation i have been on , and we travel 2 times every year for the last 25+ years here 's my opinion on some aspects of the resort : faciliites - very clean and well maintained restaurants - good to very good food never had to wait more than 10 minutes for our group of 8 we did have to split up into 2 groups to eat at the french restaurant ( even though they never did use all the tables ) be prepared to spend 2 hours or more for your dinner they really take their time in bringing out the courses pools - very nice , especially the large pool we did have one day where there was a lot of debris floating on top of the pool it was pretty nasty for some reason they did not skim the pool the previous night the cascade pool was deserted most of the week just a few people sitting around reading books bars - - conveniently located all around the resort good variety of alcohol including bud , bud light , mgd and of course presidente ( which is actually very good ) i am a tequila drinker , and i would have liked to see a better variety cuervo , to me is not a premium tequila , but that was the best they had shows - for resort shows they were quite entertaining it was not a waste of time going , and with nothing else to do in the evening , i was a good fun night outrooms - large and very comfortable we did have power issues virtually every day the power did go out daily , but it was not an inconvenience , except for the day that everyone was washing up for dinner the resort was probably at 1/2 capacity during our stay , and that included about 30-40 people from new york that came because it was srping break ( they did not come together ) 
excellence is great success i was looking at tripadvisor at some other resorts , and felt i had to go back to the excellence to write a review for a trip i took there last summer it was my honeymoon , and i have no complaints the pools were beautiful , especially the waterfall pool the staff was great , especially if you could speak a little spanish - they loved that the saxophone player was great the ocean/beach we loved , and used boogy boards in the waves everyday ( which was free ) i do not understand the negative reviews yeah , maybe it 's not the ritz , but we had a great week on our honeymoon and were sad to leave i do not think you can beat this place for the value that you get 
loved it i absolutely loved this place , it was beautiful , spotless , huge , not very croweded , the food was amazing i did get sick one night that i was there not sure if it was too much sun , something i ate or maybe the water , but it was one night and i was there for 8 days and despite getting sick i had a wonderful trip anyone that says they did not enjoy i ca not understand why we met some many negative people who complained about everything there , and i thought it was awesome , i do not get it , but wanted to say that i would absolutely go back the staff was so wonderful to , and the spa omg incredible 
it 's no secret , it 's excellent well , i have been a member of trip advisor for many years and i was presently surprised with this choice to punta cana ok , there were a few negatives but hey , even the best are not always the best arrival : i took a private car for $16 more roundtrip i was afraid of getting car sick for i often do i think it was money well spent checking in was quick champagne and cool clthes i was travelling solo was treated with great respect but may have been the only solo customer patio and hamhock cold minibar of beer and soda daily and nightly housekeeping service i loved the showers the plasma tvs were nice but yes , the bed was too hard food : i really expected horrible food and i was more then surprised being that i traveled alone , i ate mostly buffet and room service all food was above average extremely better then other all inclusives there is always something to eat at all hours beach : absolutely beautiful the water is very rough so you can only swim in one secluded area the area is very big and it 's truly for your safety the lifeguards did make sure of this however , chairs , palpas , and beds were always available it ' tru that there was always some one cleaning it and this showed what lacked here was the waiter service i had to frequently get my own drinks big deal , i sat close to the bar bar service : ca not say enough about the quality and quickness of the drinks this also im[resed me for an all inclusive resort i never had to wait for my drinks and they made some strange requests pool : blue and refreshing more croweded then the beach , but not an issue people pay more for their rooms to face thhe pool i have no idea why they would want that since there 's less privacyand more noise i loved my garden view room pro : beautiful , good fod , relaxing , nice staff and well taken care of grounds cons : can be loud at times ( staff and guests ) one hour 15 min bus ride from airport however , the pros outweigh the cons go and enjoy yourself 
excellence was excellent my boyfriend and i just returned from vacation at excellence punta cana and we loved excellence i have stayed at a few all - inclusives and this was , by far , the best place i 've ever been the staff was friendly and very nice , but some staff members were limited in their english i 'm fluent in spanish so i had no problems , my boyfriend on the other hand just referred to me for all matters since he is limited spanish the moment we arrived at the resort we knew we 'd love it because they made a great first impression a bellhop took our luggages the moment we got off the shuttle bus and brought them to our room a wet towel to clean our hands and a glass of champagne is given to you upon arrival what we liked about excellence : staff was very accomodating the rooms are very large and well kept having a full mini - bar in the room was a perk the beach was beautiful although the waves were rough at times the food was good with multiple options to choose from and being able to get a massage on the beach was the ultimate relaxation the food at the french restaurant was the best , we thought lunch at the grille was good as well having a waitress serve you drinks while you were on the beach made us feel even more relaxed and pampered i recommend taking walks along the beac at night what we did not care too much for : my boyfriend did not really like the lobster restaurant because they had warm - water lobster and he prefers cold - water lobster the drinks in the mini - bar were not always cold we were not able to use the archery or air riffles which i really wanted to try and they did not have much native/island food at the resort which is something my boyfriend and i were looking forward to eating oh , the vendors that were allowed on the resort were annoying we were shocked the resort would allow them to harrass the guest we did the bavaro adventure tour which we highly recommend our tour guide was funny and very informative about the island he remember everyone on the tours name and made sure everyone was enjoying themselves the food on the tour served lots of the native carribean foods were wanted to eat it was delicous i really do not see why anyone would complain about excellence punta cana you are on vacation so enjoy yourself and stop picking on every little detail we would go back in a heartbeat 
great resort my husband and i traveled to excellence punta cana 4/11-4/17 my priorities were weather , service , drinks , and food so i will address them in that order the weather was perfect while other travelers thought it was too windy to be on the beach , i found the wind kept me from getting overheated on the beach the beach was beautiful i got to my hut every morning at 7am so i was always able to get a prime spot the water was rough i am not a swimmer so i did not mind although a short walk to the right and you could definitely swim the pool was also amazing it was huge everyone hogged the pool floats if you wanted one mid day you could not find one the service was excellent everyone at the hotel was friendly even the people fixing the fountain would stop and say hola as you walked by the entertainment staff ( franklin , juan carlo , ines ) were a lot of fun during the day there were plenty of activities to keep my husband occupied while i lounged in my chair the waiters at the restaurant were also friendly and helpful the maids came twice a day to clean the room and for turn down service i read other reviews before i left and i definitely tipped i made sure to bring plenty of singles with me although if i did not tip nobody seemed phased we also took tennis lessons from rolando the tennis pro it was $20 an hour for my husband and i what a steal i wish we knew about it on the first day , we would have went multiple times rolando was great and really helped us a lot horseback riding was also a lot of fun my third priority was drinks they were good there were tons of bars there were always service on the beach they would come around once the bar opened with the drink of the day i loved the mudslides and the presidente unfortunately my glowing review has to come to an end with the food last time we traveled to sandals royal bahamian and the food was phenomenal while there was plenty of food at excellence i did not find much of it to be good i do not think they used quality products i also think they only way they knew how to season was to dump tons of salt on everything our first dinner at agave was so salty i could not finish it plenty of people raved about the food but i did not enjoy it we ordered room service one day and it was not even edible breakfast was decent lunch was ok and for dinner we stuck to chez isabelle we also went to dinner pretty early every night so we did not have to wait however one night we went to dinner at 9 and they already stopped accepting people at chez isabelle and it was an hour wait at toscana and barcelona i went to bed because the food was not worth waiting an hour for i really hate to say anything bad about the resort but this is one thing that would keep us from coming back 
this place was unbelievable although the ride is about an hour to get there , it was well worth it we were greeted at the steps of the resort with flutes of champagne and a warm welcome the room was just beautiful and cheerful although we had a heavy breeze at the beach , it was comfortable and made for some great surf to play in the pool was extremely clean and comfortable to float around in with your drink of the day each day there was another tropical drink that greeted us wherever we were the staff was so friendly , courtious and just wonderful i know other people have commented that they did not like the food , but let me tell you - the presentation was georgeous and the taste was delicious the only thing i can think of is that anyone complaining obviously likes to eat boxed mac and cheese and raymen noodles of the seven restaurants and our six night stay , we ate in each one and they were all fantastic we were very sad to go home we are a married couple in our late 30's with two kids and let me say this was just what we needed 
great place for a relaxing beach vacation my wife and i just returned from our visit to the excellence , punta cana where we stayed with one other couple we actually were re - directed here as a result of the resort we had chosen being over - booked we definitely ended up with the better end of that deal we were torn whether to give this resort four or five stars - we settled on 4 5 being our official rating but bumped it up to a five since they got the important things right the public areas are well done and the physical structure is beautiful the restaurants are 3 or 4 star and they do an excellent job with their outdoor theme dinners the pool is beautiful and just the right temperature i did not understand other people 's comments about the ocean not being swimmer friendly - contrary to the other reviewers , i am not a competitive swimmer and i felt quite comfortable in the water yes , it is facing the atlantic , so the water is not calm right outside the resort is where you enter the water to have some fun in the waves however , you can walk a few hundred feet to the east or roughly a quarter mile to the west and you 'll find some coral reefs which absorb all those waves and leave wonderful calm pools to swim in lawn chairs and beds ( yes , there are beds on the beach ) were always easy to find and due to the lack of other resorts in the immediate area , you have a wonderful long beach to meander on the fitness room is brand new , large , and filled with very good equipment - very pleasant surprise the shows and entertainment were rather good some negatives : the rooms were just average and provided an interesting contrast to the public areas in that they seemed to show some age the appearance of the halls is a little rough with the sloppy paint application there was some paint chipped off in the rooms which showed the colorful tones of the previous decor it almost seems as if the resort went through a major renovation and all the money was dumped into the public areas and they ran out when it came to the rooms , so they did the bare minimum to give them a slight freshening room service was somewhat inconsistent with towels and toiletries the mini - bar guys could be a little intrusive in their desire to get your fridge restocked not matter what time of day or what your state of dress was the hammock outside our room seemed like it needed replacing about two years ago coffee makers in both our and our friend 's room were broken our sliding glass door required some negotiationgs when attempting to open one night at about 10pm , the staff seemed to be bowling with empty bottles outside our room for about a half - hour again , the negatives were pretty small and petty and did not take away from our enjoyment the excellence is a great place to stay for a wonderful , relaxing beach vacation 
a great place for drunk , clueless , cheap cruise ship types i ca not quite understand how this place is so highly reviewed the property is gorgeous but the rooms are tired , the food that is touted so highly really falls short of expectations the management operates under a strict code of rules and is not flexible at all , for any reason the bedding is really poor the excellence club is only good for the fact that your room will be on the quiet side of a very large property the concierge service and the food they offer ( pathetic ) is not worth it i stayed in a swim up suite , yet the pool closes at 6:00 pm what 's the point then there is no lifeguard on duty at any time so what is their reason chemicals that are added at night what a lie do the science entertainment is cheesy and obnoxious the staff are trained with a few key phrases like welcome home and the ritz standard my pleasure the problem is that the words are insincere there were a few exceptions , though overall the employees and management seem overworked and very underpaid hence their misery if this place suits your budget , then look elsewhere for you will surely be dissapointed at any price unless you like to go somewhere where drinking at all hours amongst a lot of fat people and eating not so good food and watching not so good entertainment it all really is like a low priced cruise ship experience not for me nor for anyone that has seen the otherside oh yea , watch out for the back door porn you will accidently pass by on your channel search pretty nasty and no warning or even a channel guide in the room there was a clump of hair on the floor of my bath room about the size of a golfball that i carefully avoided that was never cleaned up in plain site for 4 days and nights 
a fabulous week just back on april 5 from a wonderful week at the excellence pc of course we were a little worried about some of the negative reviews people had posted - but no need compared to the 4 other resorts i 've stayed at in the dr and cuba , this one far outshines them all - it is a terrific resort here are a few comments from a couple of expereineced travellers : service : best i 've ever experienced at an all - inclusive resort staff seem genuinely pleasant and eager to ensure you have a great visit if you smile and try your spanish ( even if all you can say is 'ola ' ) , you will be rewarded with very positive responses resort : just gorgeous inside and out there is small wildlife reserve with walking/jogging paths in front of the resort that is really worth visiting all kinds of herons , peacocks , pink flamingos , fish , turtles , other birds , etc which they invite you to help feed we were quite impressed by this little bonus ot the resort we actually enjoyed the ride to and fro the airport - a bit bumpy but lots to see food : we were absolutely delighted with the breakfast and lunch buffets - both quantity and quality was great we would have been happy with the buffet for all 3 meals really excellent , fresh food , with tons of variety you would have to be a really exceptionally picky eater not to thoroughly enjoy the buffet between the extensive fresh salad bar ( dr tomatoes are the best ) , fresh local fruit , ample hot selections , fresh grill station ( meats and fish ) , pasta station and good desserts - this was by far the best buffet of any ai i 've ever stayed at in fact , we feel it easily compares to 5- star lunch and breakfast buffets we 've eaten at in north america clean , fresh , and incredible service as well the a la carte restaurants provided excellent service and we only had to wait once for a few minutes it 's actually a pleasure to wait - in the tropical evening air with a nice drink - who can complain about that but the food was hit and miss notably , the chateaubriand in chez isabelle , the tenderloin and stuffed shrimp meals in barcelona and the steak dinners in the grill were very good but overall , we felt the quality of the food in the a la cartes really was not as high as the buffet we really did not enjoy the food at spice at all , and found the toscana so - so many of the appetizers and desserts were mediocre - which we could not understand since they are so good on the buffet the a la carte menu selections and descriptions sounded great , but sometimes were not as described when they arrived it 's a shame , because as i 've said , the service and atmosphere were top notch but certainly , nothing was terrible , and we did enjoy our evening meals overall it seems that maybe the executive chef has more of a direct hand in the dialy buffets , than he does in the kitchens of the a la carte restaurants room service is quick and pretty good - my boyfreind loved the excellence burger pool and beach : most amazing , winding , beautiful pool i 've ever seen at an ai i found the temperature perfect if you 're a pool person , you 'll be in heaven unfortunately , i 'm a beach person the beach was gorgeous , but the wind and water were so rough that the no swimming or danger flags were up all week and there is a really crazy undertow and riptide but if you walk a few minutes to the right , just off the resort property , there are some natural breakers and you can enjoy some swimming and lazing safely in the beautiful calm water but this was a bit of a pain , as we had to walk up to the end of the resort each time we wanted a dip on the last day we ended up pitching our towels right up there and staying for a few hours unfortunately , this means no chair and no beach service when we were back on the the resort section of the beach , the service was just excellent - cold drinks and even food if you wanted it but on a couple days the sand was blowing so hard , even i had to break down and leave the beach , which was pretty much empty by that time i really am a beach lover and this was the only real negative for me for this otherwise fab resort i would have loved to have spent way more time on that great beach a couple of the staff commented that it was unusually windy and rough , but judging from other reviews i 've read on here , the high wind seems to be common there ( i see that two people drowned no tlong ago ) we could hear the crazy surf just pounding frm our hotel room constantly - which was nice to see and hear - but not so nice if you wanted to spend your day on the beach in and out of the water room : just perfect , way beyond our expectations we loved the jacuzzi and nice clean terry slippers and robes we were in excellence club with ocean view and loved it note - in the ec rooms you get several bottles of liquore in addition to what 's in your fridge we asked to change what we had for baileys and malibu rum and no problem also requested lots of juice , diet coke and tonic water in the bar fridge we just left a note and a couple $ on the fridge and that guy was our friend the whole week lots of good tv , movie channels to choose from when you wanted to flake out excursions : the resort was so gorgeous there really was not much need to go off the grounds , but we decided to do the dunebuggy ride excursion one afternoon aside from one stop at a little coffee/cocoa plantation , it was really just an excuse to take you to various stalls to buy souvenirs they did stop at a neat cave and a beach , but both were packed with people from other tours ( atvs , horses , etc ) and were full of gargbage and people trying desperately to sell you stuff also , a good part of it was driving on a busy street - and those machines were definitely not street - safe we did get to see a bit of the countryside , but were mainly unimpressed with this , and definitely would not do it again for $65/person shopping : to the left , just off the resort propert y is a group of stalls selling souvenirs you can get some nice things there we got a couple of nice dr paintings and several beatiful sarongs for much cheaper than we saw them anywhere else , including the airport ask for chris in the stall called 'walmart ' - he is really delightful , his english is great and no high - pressure sales going on but those are the things i wanted to highlight we had an absolutely wonderful week - this is truly an excellent resort but becasue of the beach , i do not think i would do this particular one again - but i thik we will probably try one of the other excellence properties in mexico next year 
great relaxing resort with a bad beach we stayed at the excellence for a week over new years eve this was our first all inclusive resort vacation in the caribbean , although we both have vacation experiences elsewhere in the world to compare it to the excellence had very nice rooms , a fantastic pool , good bars and drinks , and what we would rate as 3- star restaurants we were pleased with the overall service and condition of the resort and would call the facilities 4- star however , we were very disappointed with the beach and water the ocean was quiet rough and murky - basically un - swimmable for us , an ex - lifeguard and a good swimmer both used to the atlantic the beach was ok , though not the lovely white sand one can find elsewhere in the caribbean our only other major complaints about the resort were that their best restaurant , chez isabel , was closed without notice the entire time we were there and we had one very stormy day that was a complete wash since the resort is very isolated and there is no where to go and nothing to do when the weather does not cooperate our entertainment options during the storm were snakes on a plane on a big screen or board games ( and , of course , booze ) we would recommend the resort to couples interested in a very relaxing , easy going vacation not so great for families with adult children ( the resort is 18+ only ) or for singles 
terrific holiday from ottawa canada please excuse my late review re : my week at the excellence punta cana my mother and i flew in for a week on easter sunday this is my third visit to punta cana - the last being at the paradisus palma real the paradisus was beautiful , and the food was incredible - the difference at the excellence was the incredible service from everyone - from the executive chef - bert , through the entertainment staff - franklin , innez , alexandra , juan carlos , through to the servers - pedro and i am apoggizing for forgetting his name - if anyone is reading this from the excellence - he was a server every day during that week in the pool area just off the lobby through to the excellent service from the front desk - raul and the bellboys - rueben unlike other hotels - the excellence has a disco that caters to more than the 20 somethings - a whole night of 70's and 80' 's music the food was terrific - listen to other reviews - the chateaubriand at the chez isabelle is delicious , and most dishes at spice are great at lunchtime , pizza is delivered to you right at the pool/beach every day there is something cooked up at the beach - burgers , fajitas , etc - so you never have to go inside if you 'd prefer not to the staff at the excellence are truly there to make sure that you have a wonderful vacation - if there is anything that they can do to make things better for you - they do thank you for a wonderful vacation 
great adult vacation my husband and i visited excellence during february and were very pleased with this resort we found our room to be very clean and quite comfortable the pool is crystal clear and gives the guests many cozy areas to relax and enjoy the quiet the beach was very inviting with many hammocks , cushioned chairs and beds to clear your mind and unwind the staff was always circulating around the areas to replenish refreshments and clean away any empties there were many daily activities by the pool for those wishing to participate we were club members and found the treats served in the beautiful lounge each day delicious roberto , the club manager , was warm and friendly and made us feel very welcomed during our resort stay we found the food in all the restaurants to be above average and abundant for the amount of people being served daily there was not anything more to ask for on the breakfast buffets we also utilized the room service menu and they were prompt and courteous the open - air atmosphere in the lobby and the abundance of soft seating throughout allowed guests to view/hear any entertainment taking place that evening the entire staff was very friendly and accommodating and this resort met all our vacation expectations although we love children ( we 've raised six ) , we found the adult atmosphere a real plus to reconnect , relax and refresh our lives 
i just got home from an amazing 5 day honeymoon at excellence and i am missing it i read reviews on this site before i went and after my return , and ca not believe some of what i am reading my experience was incredible the place was gorgeous and very clean someone was aways smiling , greeting you with a hola and taking care of you however they could yes , there are occassional language barriers , but hello - you 're in another country make an effort and you get a lot in return ( i speak no spanish , but i smiled a lot and treated people with courtesy the food was not fabulous , but it was by no means bad there were so many choices we met quite a few other couples and had a lot of fun i was worried about mosquitoes , but never got bit i did have on bug spray again , another country sure the entertainment was cheesy some nights , but other nights it was fun nothing appeals to everyone jose took great care of us at the kaffee cafe my drinks were never - ending and always tasted great the pool and beach were both lots of fun as well we never had problems with towels or floats it was crowded , but therew as always space this was truly the best trip of my life and i 'm scared to ever try anoother resort because i feel excellence punta cana has set the bar so high 
not so excellent well - what can i say - disappointing at best how anyone can deem this place 5 star is beyond me we arrived for a weeks stay at the excellence and where faced with the same nightmare tour of the area via the 'deluxe ' tour bus air conditioning was obviously not considered a necessity arrival to the hotel ( eventually ) and we were faced with a warm glass of 'champagne ' proceed to check in and straight away we got the whole why we should upgrade thrown at us ok - it sounded good so we did ( after a good bit of haggling initially room seemed ok but that impression soon went out of the window the bath was dirty and even after cleaning you can imagine the quick exit when the brown scum floating in the water was noticed it was clear 'cleaning ' is term best used loosely as apart from a quick tidy of the bed there certainly was not much in the way of cleaning of the room toileties where not replenished even after 3 requests the upgrade was supposed to offer fresh fruit and flowers daily - of course that never happened agree that the beach is really quite nice - clean and easy to walk on and the pool area is pretty good with the swim up bar and staff on hand but to be honest those are the only two real high points of this hotel i cannot believe everyone seems to overlook the horrific 'entertainment ' appalling is the best word to describe this from the karoke and i kid you not - bingo to the embarassing attempts at a band to some strange interpretation of michael jackson dancing by what look like at best a high school show ( infact thats an insult to high school shows ) there is no escaping this mediocore 'butlins holiday camp ' as it is thrust at you in the only real area to go for a pre - dinner drink the background music consistened daily of the same cd stuck on repeat - and it was not a good cd there was also an attempt to entertain us in the lobby with some bizarre organ style music - it was so painful we eventually gave up and left food was edible but that was about it if you could actually get into a restaurant - i had to resort to using a steak knife on chicken and then the rules about dress code considering they would allow entry to people dressed in dirty trainers yet if you were a man with trendy flip flops - forget it - you were not getting in to give the illisusion of being a high end resort by forcing people to conform to an outdated view of acceptable dress i found hysterical i appreciate a lot of other guest really have enjoyed their stay but if you are looking for true 5 star with great service and food i really would not recommend this hotel at all spend your hard earned money elsewhere 
very disappointing it was over an hour drive to the resort from the airport and in my opinion , not very pretty scenery which scared me a bit as to what to expect there were local men urinating on the side of the road in plain view as we headed to the resort the resort property itself was very pretty the staff were friendly but did not speak/understand much english we had a difficult time communicating with most it took 2 days to obtain washcloths which we were told we 'd have in 5 minutes our coffee pot was missing the towels were like sandpaper the toilet leaked all over the floor and we had an ant problem there was an open bottle of water in the refridgerator and an open bottle of lotion on the vanity the food was mediocre at best the drinks were ok especially if you asked for a specific drink instead of one of the pre - mixed ones where you could watch them make it the beach is ok as far as the seating , but it 's actually on the atlantic side of the island not the carribbean as we thought and the water is much rougher , we were never able to get in no snorkeling unless ( so we were told ) you walked around the bend to the calmer waters of the carribbean we never made it , because it was too windy and the vendors off the resort would harass you constantly the nightly shows were very cheesy impersonators of cher , madonna , michael jackson and elvis pretty much every night in some form or another we had a lounge singer with canned music one night we never stayed long i do not understand the 5- star rating , other than their presentation is done very well it is indeed a very pretty resort , but i would not go back and would not recommend it to anyone in fact , i would not go back to this island at all 
laid - back chic just arrived back from dr yesterday - we had a great week at excellence and agree that of the many all - inclusives we have seen over the last 20- odd years in the caribbean , this was the best resort layout we 've seen despite a day or two of rainy/windy weather , we still got our beach walks in and the sunny day temperatures were balmy - just right due to the vast number of positive reviews , i will not go into any detail as it 's all been said before do not be put off by remarks on the poor road conditions leading to the resort , though - we 've got worse road conditions in places right here at home we both enjoyed looking around during the drive 
fan - freakin - tastic my wife and i just returned from a short four night stay at the excellence in punta cana and had an absolutely fabulous time we stayed in an ordinary garden view room and were quite pleased with the accommodations after a lot of consideration , we decided not to go with the excellence club upgrade and were quite happy to have saved our few hundred bucks as we felt the service and room quality in the ordinary rooms were excellent not much more can be said than what has already been written in the hundreds of reviews about this place , but given the recent negative ones , i thought i would contribute nonetheless first off , i will start with the beach as virtually everyone says , the beach if gorgeous it is long and wide , has many chairs , beds and palapas and has incredibly soft sand ( albeit a nice brown not the white that you see in some caribbean locations ) the water is indeed rough but we found the waves quite fun to play in and not unsafe provided you did not venture too far out off shore overall , i would rate the beach as one of the prettiest i have been , laying on the sun bed and listening to the waves on the ocean was one of the highlights of our trip as has been mentioned repeatedly in these reviews , the service at excellence is superb unlike the sandals we were at last year in the bahamas , drink service around the pool and on the beach was great service at the bars and in the restaurants was very friendly and fast virtually every worker you met , right from the grounds people to the wait staff always seemed genuinely concerned with how things were going for you and were always quick to greet you with a cheery hola the nightly entertainment was a blast and very well done we saw the circus act ( sort of a mini circe de soleil ) , the magic show , the stars ( a music and dance act ) and the 70's and 80's rewind all of the shows were simply superb and well beyond the quality we expected for a venue such as this so long as you do not expect las vegas polish , you will be happy with the performances from these very talented individuals the workout facility at the excellence was quite good as well the building in which it was housed was a little hot at times , but the equipment was quite new and seemed very well maintained it was never busy the times we were there ( about 8:00 in the morning ) overall , we found the food at the excellence to be great i am not sure what the expectations of many of the previous reviewers were who had negative things to say about the food , but as compared to other all - inclusives we have been to ( including most recently the sandals grand bahamian ) , the excellence is top notch we even felt it compared favourably to the food we had experienced on a disney cruise we were on a couple of years ago great selection , great presentation and great service sure , sometimes the meals did not taste exactly the way you might expect them at home , but that does not mean they did not taste great , just different for those who have significant complaints about the food , you are either incredibly fussy and should be taking all - inclusive vacationing off of your to - do list or are looking too hard to find negatives the shopping on and off the grounds in the mini - markets was quite fun as well we were quite surprised at the number of options available to us for souvenirs and gifts sure , you need to haggle which is not very fun for some , but generally if you realize that the first price the vendors give you is just under double their bottom line price , you will do fine for the few things we purchased , we usually ended up somewhere between 25% and 35% off of their original asking price the drive to the excellence is a bit long and the road is rough , but it does give you a decent opportunity to see the local landscape and country i would have preferred it if the hotel were a half hour rather than an hour from the airport but we felt that the long drive was a small price to pay for the wonderfully secluded setting which the hotel enjoys overall , i would rate the excellence as one of our top destinations and certainly the best all - inclusives we have been to if you are looking for a nice , romantic get away you wo not be disappointed with excellence punta cana 
the name says it all the hotel was truly excellent the service was fantastic people very friendly and fun the pool went on forever , but really the truly distinguishing feature were the amazing luxurious four post beds along the beach and pool life can not get better than laying in a bed on the beach watching the carribean ocean , being served drinks the food was good and had a wide variety of restuarants to choose from with different atmospheres the entertainment team was energetic and kept the day full of events that were fun julio was numero uno the only two pointers that may have improved my stay was 1 ) i wish i had prearranged my hotel transfer to and from airport before we got there ) i wish i had brushed up on my spanish 
pampering at its utmost my husband and i spent a wonderful week at this resort the weather was perfect we began our visit by being greeted by edwin ortiz , chief concierge he immediately made us feel that our needs were of the utmost importance after being brought to our room we were somewhat disappointed with its location in the resort we reported this to edwin and he searched available rooms and relocated us to a beautiful pool view room throughout the week he checked with us to be sure that all was well we must say that all of the staff members were extraordinarily cordial and well versed in their individual tasks we enjoyed the food , most especially the french and italian restaurants lunch was a treat at the beach each day , paella , chichen and ribs , burgers and brats , and the pizza man always delivered delicious , hot pizza to us on the beach we loved the resort and the only minor disappointment were the rooms although they appear to be refurbished and clean they were not top shelf the public areas on the other hand were up to date and very well designed we would definitely recommed this resort 
best time ever at excellence punta cana my husband and i stayed at excellence from 3/20 to3/24 and it was the best vaction yet i booked the trip in november so i had plenty of time to read the reviews some were very informative while others were just over the top yes the ride to the resort is bumpy , but considering the time we had it was well worth it the people at the resort were the best they really know how to treat people the food was good too our favorite was the grill and chez isabell we chose the excellence club but really didnt need it there was more than enough food and drinks that your cup never went empty the shows were good too we met some really nice couples who also loves the place i must address the beach it really was as rough as other have said there lobster house features a dominican lobster so if your use to maine lobster this may be a little different we also had ants on the vanity in the room , but was address right away we cant forget to say hola to joel and carlos of the entertainment team and jose the funniest bartender at the cafe bar we had a great time laughing with you guys keith the cigar guy says hello we will see you guys again despite the small stuff excellence is truly paradise i cant wait to return excellence is truly the most beautiful resort on the island take the professional pictures they are really beautiful and they made our anniversay one to remember 
loved the excellence punta cana resort in the dominican republic the staff was very friendly , courteous , and nice the entertainment staff was wonderful and exciting and engaging , especially , franklin , joel , juan carlos , julio , carlos , etc the housekeepers , waitstaff , and all of the staff was just excellent i will definitely stay there again real soon the food and the ambiance at the restaurants was very good my hotel room was beyond amazing my hotel room had a jacuzzi , modern shower stall , and a walk out patio that opened right onto the pool you have to go , you will never want to leave i personally want to live there i even did a few excursions and the locals were very nice if you have questions , email me at rrascoe1@aol 
loved excellence - one of our best vacations ever one of the problems with these reviews is that you really do not know the tastes and standards of the person writing the review , therefore you ca not be sure if you 'll have the same experience as they 've described let me say that i live in a nice home , with a nice in ground pool , i adore food , i love to cook , and my husband and i go out to dinner frequently ( great restaurants are plentiful in monmouth county , nj where i live ) we also travel a fair amount ( both business and pleasure ) , spend lots of time at the beaches near our home and go to the theatre several times a year that said , here is my review excellence is a beautiful , tranquil paradise that truly lives up to its name nothing has been overlooked : the beach is magnificent , and rivals the beaches of hawaii ( where we spent our honeymoon ) the pools and grounds are sparklingly clean and beautifully designed and the rooms are both comfortable and tasteful ( except for the very graphic 24 porn channel ) we have stayed at many other resorts in the carribean , and have always contended with minor , annoying problems , such as scrambling for dinner reservations , searching for a comfortable spot in the shade , and getting enough ( or any ) towels without considerable frustration none of that occured at excellence it was the first vacation that was completely stress - free ( until our ride back to the airport but i 'll get to that later ) our one minor problem with the air conditioning was remedied with 10 minutes of calling the front desk honestly , my only complaint was that the sports bar did not have any popcorn to munch on during the ncaa tournament even the food - which has been much maligned by reviewers on this site - was very good was it gourmet was it as good as most cruise cuisine well , no , but it was still very good let me put it this way - i always found something i enjoyed , and several times during our stay i actually found the food to be we also enjoyed the entertainment , thought the room was lovely ( our bed at home is very comfortable , but the bed in our room , although firm , was perfectly fine ) and really appreciated how hard the staff worked to keep us happy everyone greeted us with a smile and a hola , and constantly told us that is was their pleasure to serve us from check - in to check out , the staff was completely attentive , warm and delightful now to the trip to and from the airport the ride to excellence was fine because we had a wonderful , considerate driver unfortunately , the ride back to the airport was awful first , the driver was an hour late , and then he drove like a maniac , nearly taking out several pedestrians along the way i do not know how this can be avoided , i guess it just depends on which type of driver you get pray that you are lucky finally , a couple of suggestions : 1 bring a small flashlight , as it may come in handy at night bring about $50 00 in singles for tipping - although it is not necessary , a dollar here and there is much appreciated by the staff if you forget your book , sunscreen , etc sundries and a small lending library are available at the beach hut ( books and games are also available at the sports bar ) although the ocean directly in front of the resort is not really rough ( especially if you 've ever been to point pleasant , nj ) if you prefer more tranquil water , walk approximately 5 minutes to the right if you do opt to walk to the tranquil section of the beach , be aware that you will likely be approached by a local man selling wares from a hut next to the resort he is extremely aggressive , and his prices are ridiculously high try to avoid him unless you really want to purchase something lastly , all the ingredients for a fantastic vacation await you at excellence just pack a postive outlook , and let the cares of home melt away 
the excellence was excellent we just returned from the excellence - we stayed march21-28 i was a bit nervous after reading some reviews before leaving however , after our stay i am actually surprised at some of the poor reviews the ride to the hotel is no different than any other island ride i have ever been on fast and bumpy - that is how they drive it took about an hour the room and the grounds were spotless the beach was perfect there were plenty of chairs to go around at the pool and the beach the drinks were fine the beach and pool side service was great the workers were all helpful , not all speak english but they try to help you tips are not expected but are greatly appreciated there are no tip jars or envelopes keep in mind you are not in america their version of american food or any other food may be a bit different it is their culture to be dressed for meals so do not expect to go to a restaurant in your bathing suit and tank top guys - girls need a coverup long pants for dinner for the guys the girls usually dress sundresses/skirts/capris i saw a few mosquitos - literally 3 half dead mosquitos so i had no problem the resort is on the atlantic side of the ocean , so it is rough and red flagged daily - walk to the right of the beach and you will be able to swim in the ocean - it was great to the left of the resort there are vendors selling their goods it is quite an experience - to be fair we looked at everyones shop , bought what we wanted - bargained for the best prices too be sure to go to nancy 's shop in the back did i mention the pool it goes forever , you can just float around all day and it is spotless the entertainment was fine the bed is a bit hard - that would be the only downfall yipee ( i have 3 myself ) so the break was greatwe had a great time and will return - hopefully next year 
trust my review - its amazing my husband and i have just returned from a week at the excellence as a belated honeymoon summed up in a word , it was paradise the food was amazing with a huge choice breakfast was fresh with a varied selection we had omlettes freshly made with any fillings you wanted there was lots of fresh fruit as well as a huge hot selection you could even choose your fruit and have a fresh smoothie made lunch again was really good - we liked the grill for lunch - more relaxed and food was delicious we tried all 7 restaurants and all the food was really good our favourites were the thai and grill you can have really good wine or champagne all day and all through the meals ( if you can handle it all ) all the staff were helpful , polite and cheerful and would do anything to make your stay a happy one we left a tip daily for our lovely maid and our room was immaculate the shows every night were very professional and we visited the nightclub once for a good old dance we even ventured into the casino a few times and managed to win enough money to cover our expenses the pool was beautiful - lovely temperature and huge the beach is lovely and you can walk for miles if like us you ate far too much i really cant believe anyone can find fault in the hotel - we absolutely loved it there the only 1 negative was the horse riding we were offered as the horses were terribly thin and it did upset me that they were not well looked after - if you are an animal lover better not to do this 
this was our first trip to the dominican and we had read a lot about the excellence resort most was positive and so we were very excited we were not dissapointed at all it was one of the most relaxing vacations spots we did not upgrade to the excellence club and we do not feel like we missed anything i say it because we were treated royally regardless i ca not imagine how we would have been treated any different if we did the service is terrific the staff are happy and seem to enjoy what they are doing we tipped generously ( us $$ not pesos ) but never felt that it was expected but much appreciated our room was wonderful and we recommend opening the balconey doors which automatically turns the ac off and enjoy the warm breezes and the sound of the ocean and wind at night it lulls you to sleep amazingly the bed is hard but we slept well and awoke comfortably in mornings we have never seen such a spotless resort it seemed that 24/7 they were cleaning something they even take the shades off the lamps and wash them and dry them in the sun food was good and what you should expect for an all inclusive better then others i have stayed at they do have a silly dress policy but when in dr we were not there for the cuisine but we were fed well whenever we were hungry our favorite places were the outdoor restaurants the lobster and grill ( had lunch at the grill almost every day ) the only inside restaurant we went to was the asian and it was fabulous we ate there twice and recommend the mahi mahi pedro was our favorite staff member we stayed away from the others indoor restaurants because we like casual dining and wanted to be outside as much as possible you can understand if you are from new england like us the french and spanish sites were inside and overlit , fancy stuffy i call them and not islandy night life was great there is a wonderful outside bar on the beach and by the pool that we sat at every nite you can enjoy most of the entertainment from this venue ( or the bar at the theater it opens to the outside bar ) we tried our luck at the tiny , but fun , casino the people watching in the casino was the most fun not the gambling the nightclub is mostly the younger crowd but we got our share of the dance floor and had fun the nightly shows were ok things you must do grab a float in the pool and puruse the gounds on a leisurely swim the length of the pool stop at the swim up bar and relax it is heaven order breakfast in your room ( we had ocean view so it was glorious you can get most of what is offered in the buffet but much more relaxing and romantic at least one afternoon secure one of the lean - to beds on the beach after swimming , a lite lunch and a few cocktails spend the end of the day with a nap and the warm breeze floating across your body and the wonderful peaceful ocean serenade do spend as much time on the beach and relax someone is always offering you a drink later in the afternoon they bring around pizza actually it is tasty and i am fussy about my pizza walk the beach , ride the waves , have fun it is wonderful we ca not wait to go back 
amazing beach and pool - absolutely horribly food my wife and i recently stayed at excellence punta cana ( march 12-17 2008) this was our second experience staying at an all inclusive resort , so we had high expectations after a wonderful stay in st to start , we flew non - stop from newark , nj to punta cana the flight was quick and direct , so it really worked great after landing in punta cana , and being forced to pay $10 to enter the country , i quickly began to wonder if our vacation was doomed after a quick snapshot with a few ladies with banana and coconut head - dresses , we cleared customs , picked up our luggage and were escorted to our transportation which was arranged by liberty travel the bus was decent enough ( air conditioning was included ) , however it was extremely bumpy we made around 5 stops at other hotels as we drove through the dominican countryside excellence was the last stop made , and by the time we got there , my wife and i were the only two remaining on our not - so deluxe tour bus overall , the trip took around an hour and a half from the airport and my wife ( who i might add is recently pregnant ) was not happy we were greeted upon our arrival by an army of hotel staff , and the all too expected glass of cheap champagne i was pleasantly surprised by my overall first impression of the hotel the main greeting area was open and airy and our greeting was first class we checked in and were brought to our room our ever so anxious bellman showed us where the toilet was and how to turn on the tv , and was off before a blink of an eye , and a few dollars in hand one of the only major problems we encountered ( besides the god awful food ) was with our mini - bar in our room it 's not because i enjoy my el presidente 's ice cold ( that 's true ) but we needed a cold fridge to store some medication my wife needed to take daily the min bar fridge was not working at all the beers and sodas inside were all warm , if not hot i immediately inquired at the front desk and was told that it was not really a fridge but was just there to keep the drinks cold i asked for a new one and explaining about my wife 's med 's they said they would take care of it we explored the hotel for an hour or two , then returned to the room to find that nothing had been done i returned to the front desk and inquired again this time i was told that my wife could store her medication behind the front desk which was totally unacceptable he again told me that the mini bar fridge was not really designed to keep the drinks cold but this time rather cool at this point i told him this was unacceptable and to get a cold refrigerator to the room immediately after some more poking and prodding , two men showed up with a working refrigerator and replaced the piece of garbage in the room the kick in the but was they actually had the audacity to ask me to see the medication , after they replaced the original fridge i showed it to them and then told to get out of my room and sent they guy packing with out a tip besides the meet and greet with the cooler council , i was impressed by they hotels grounds the beach is absolutely beautiful the sand is so soft , no rocks or shells in our of the water the weather was pretty much perfect our entire stay too i really ca not impress on how beautiful the beach was you can walk for miles along the beach amongst the giant palms i met a few locals who were nice a few guys tried to sell me everything under the sun my plan from day one was to simply sit on the beach and tan my pasty white nj skin and read a good book the pool was exceptional as well the swim up bar was perfect i floated over many a time , and swam away with a el presidente or el coco loco the beach and pool service was excellent the staff was great and friendly they were pretty much at your every beck and call all day long they periodically showed up with snacks including pizzas , drinks , or what ever you could possibly desire overall , the service staff was great i felt kind of bad for them sometimes ( quite a lot of people do not tip a dime ) , but also because these guys seem to live at that place they guy who was serving you breakfast was also bringing you drinks at the beach mid - day , and working the bar at midnight i 'm not going to spend to much time detailing the food overall , all i 'm going to say is that if you used to decent american food , you will be disappointed the food just was not good they have a vast array of restaurants to choose from , and we tried them all , and they were pretty much all poor i can pretty much tolerate anything , but my wife was disgusted i understand she 's pregnant , and she was not feeling great overall , but the food did not help at all at least twice , i thought she was poisoned by day two , we pretty much stuck to eggs at breakfast , mysterious burger for lunch and whatever i could stomach for dinner honestly , i think they try had to prepare nice meals , but the quality of the products overall is poor at best island drinks were not great either , so i stuck to the el presidente 's all week long which i did not mind the rooms were ok at best the bed was so hard it was unbelievable i woke up every morning by 6:00 am because my back was absolutely broken we also had a major leak on two separate nights water just started pouring out of the ceiling in our bathroom we told the front desk they did not seem to concerned i guess i really should not complain about 24 hour a day free porn either to summarize , i can say that if your looking for an absolutely beautiful beach and pool , and just looking to relax in the tropic 's , and can stand bad food , this is the place for you if your a foodie , forget about it we read so many times that excellence was a 5 star resort , but i really ca not image what some people are thinking i 'll give it three starts at best the place definitely has great potential , but with such great facilities , staff and weather , i would expect so much more i probably would not recommend excellence to a friend??aybe an enemy 
i would definitely go back we ended up here in december since the majestic became overbooked and i am glad they made our mind up for us the place was very nice and i enjoyed most of the staff we took advantage of most of the activities and i can honestly say i enjoyed the evening shows my wife and i are in our 30s and so were many of the couples there we met some great people as the week went on and are actually attending the wedding of a couple we made friends with during their engagement trip i thought the food was good it was not breath - taking but i do not typically expect that at an all inclusive we ate our fill of lobster tail , steak , and sushi we stayed at grand lido in negril the year before and i thought the food at excellence was much better i suppose you ca not please everyone but i never had any complaints it is an adults only experience so there are no kiddies running around and they provide 24/7 adult television programming by day 3 channel 21 is pretty much an inside joke at the pool if you stay here , relax , join in some of the campy activities , have a drink and have fun 
total relaxation truly a beautiful , spotless , romantic experience my boyfriend and i really needed a low - key , relaxing vacation and excellence certainly provided that and more i will just say ditto to the glowing reviews that have preceded this and add a few comments only a month old great machines ( or so my boyfriend said i stayed at the pool/beach 2) getting our pictures done by the professional photographer was wonderful franc from spain did ours he was great , a lot of fun , and the photos turned out very well and only 80 dollars for 20 great shots on a cd 3) food ranged from great to okay loved the breakfasts and lunches food could be quite salty neither one of us had any tummy trouble and we ate just about everything ( proven to us by the scale our lovely room ) hard to find a negative only thing that i was disappointed in was the spa and the yoga the spa treatments we had manicure and massages were simply not that great we had planned to do more at the spa but after the first massages cancelled our other appointments they do not offer yoga they now call it stretching this is not a spa resort nor is it a yoga resort to sum it up fantastic , refreshing place with beautifully maintained grounds and a staff that works incredibly hard loved it and would go back tomorrow 
we went to excellence to truly enjoy some peace and quiet from our busy nyc life it was a truly relaxing resort that allowed us to reconnect as a couple , which needed much rest from raising a 2 year old we never left the resort for 7 days - mainly because the taxis were very expensive and nothing was nearby the only downside to this resort is the dinner menu breakfast and lunch were very good but , dinner food lacked however , the daily actividades kept us busy until we went to bed the shows each night were great , and we really loved to party in the club with our favorite employee ray go ray , go ray he and the staff add so much to the resort and the experience we recommend this resort if you want to relax and have a good time 
relaxing vacation , terrible food let me start by saying that there are many pros to the resort : beautiful grounds , impressive pool , hardworking and friendly staff we had a relaxing time hanging out by the pool or on the beach this was what we were looking for in this vacation however , an important element to any vacation is the food unfortunately , the food at excellence is mediocre at best we did not have one satisfying meal at any of the restaurants at the resort everything was either overcooked , over - dry or over - salty for the first time during a vacation , we did not look forward to any upcoming meal and that in itself , was a major disappointment another complaint is that the pool closes at 6pm i 've been to other all - inclusive resorts where some of the most enjoyable moments were going for a late - night swim in the pool after dinner overall the experience was nice and the staff was great but if good food is an important part of your vacation , i would not recommend staying here 
loved the place this place was great the hotel is more villagey , if thats even a word i never liked staying at places that feel or look like a hotel everything about the place was great , from food beach too bad the person i went with was a miserable person 
relaxing break great place to relax and unwind rooms are 4 star - comfortable but not immaculately maintained - but you are not going to be spending much time duing the day there room service is pretty good and relatively quick the grounds are well maintained with a little wildlife sancutary with parrots and a peacock the beach was lovely - well maintained and did not feel crowded at all despite the hotel being full the first couple of days were quite windy , the rest of the following week had a nice breeze on the beach - which provided a relief fron the burning sun also - pretty good service at the beach the pool was nice and quietwe were dissappointed with the quality of the resturaunts - apart from spices , the other eateries were not great for evening dinner suprisingly - there was not a regular local food eatery - despite the dominicans are best in making local food however - breakfast was good however , overall this was a nice and relaxing holiday - 
ultra luxury wow just got back from a 4 day stay at excellence punta canai went to take my husband for his birthday weekend talk about gorgeous weather , excellent staff , plenty of food options , and many things to do the ride from the airport was about 40 minutes but it was well worth it best of the best i would definately recommend it to any discerning traveler 
my best friend and i recently returned from a 5- night stay at the excellence punta cana resort and it was truly excellent we loved the service , the facilities and the activities there were several dining options and fun things to do the resort also offered serenity when we wanted to just sit back and relax the staff really exemplified service excellence i celebrated my birthday during my stay and the concierge staff decorated my room and surprised me with a cake - nicki you are the best thank you for making my birthday special our requests were addressed right away and in the most pleasant manner - thanks to edwin ortiz we give many thanks to franklin for his engaging spanish lessons every morning - franklin your personality shines the brightest the entertainers really created a lively atmosphere with their energy everywhere from poolside to the disco - juan carlos , we loved your bachata as for drinks , yuli , fabio and domingo were ??he best? we can?? forget about the food - simply delicious - and the refined manners and attentiveness of kelvin and ramon added a special touch to the dining experience our continued enthusiasm about the excellence punta cana resort has everything to do with the wonderful people working there they made it more than just a beautiful place to stay whether we were on the beach , in the spa , shopping or enjoying a show , everyone was very nice and accommodating i think the spirit of the staff brought out the best in us - we were saying ??ola? to just about everybody from day 1 ( and we don?? do that around here ) since our return a week ago , we have recommended this resort to everyone we know muchas gracias por un trabajo bien hecho nj from nj 
super excellente we stayed from 20th february to 5th march 2008 we travelled as a family of three english people we had two garden/mountain view rooms in building 11 we had room 11111( yes five ones very easy to remember ) and 11706 the rooms were good , spacious , clean and well presented the maid always did a good job the mini bar was restocked everyday and the turn down service was excellent we got towel art regulary both our rooms looked over ponds with fountains and lots of coconut trees and tropical plants when we came to our rooms at the end of an evening we liked to watch the fire flies flying around the lights in the distance , as we had never seen them before the grounds were very well maintained and you never saw any mess the flamingoes , parrotts , ducks , chickens and turkeys were lovely and some of them had youngsters the security was very good with regular patrols day and night the restaurants were all good we thought agave was the most fun with the merengue band playing to you we then liked toscana , spice , barcelona , lobster and the grill we did not go to chez isobel or oregano the pool was great very well maintained during the day and cleaned at night the main pool is massive and very upscale the drink service was brilliant we drank beer , sammy sosas , miami vices and lots of water the pizza delivery man came to your chair every lunch time it was great as we did not have to change to go for lunch if we did not want too you could also get small sandwiches from the sol bar the beach was good but the ocean was rough but well maintained the drink service was good there as well we walked the beach everyday and found a nice area to swim in the shows and ice breakers were good our favourites were the dominican , circus , international , magic and of course the micheal jackson we went to the disco twice it was good and the entertainment team were good dancers and fun we listened and danced alot to domingo 's music both in the lobby and in plaza santo domingo we also danced to merengue bands when domingo was not working while the entertainments were going on in the evenings we were supplied with our favourite drinks white wine , champagne , drambuie , water and even hot tea the hotel staff were all fantastic and really nice some were really special and went that extra mile if you are thinking of going to stay at this hotel put your hands up in the air and go it is wonderful 
absolutely loved the excellence my boyfriend and i stayed at the excellence punta cana from 2/8 to 2/15 and had a wonderful time we had friends coming in on that sunday and they too had a great time , wished they could have stayed longer i will say the ride to the resort was horrible , very scary , saw my life flash before my eyes a couple times , it was an hour and a half but , once we got to the resort all the stresses from traveling faded away we were greeted w/a wet towel , and wonderful people the resort is amazing we stayed at the club which was great , they gave us champagne while we checked in with the private concierge , there was a lobby with internet accessibility and food which was fabulous the food was good i loved breakfast at the buffet , you could make your own omelet the asian restuarant was our favorite and our friends raved about the french restaurant room service was great you could call at anytime of night and get something , they were soo nice i loved the pizza the beach was a little rough , i did not go in past my knees because it was too rough for me , but that did not stop other people my boyfriend asked me to marry him the very first night on the beach laying on a hammock it was magical we did dinner one night on the beach , it was very windy , romantic , but very windy the pool was beautiful too all the fruit hits you after a bit , bring some tums , you 'll need it overall , we loved it definitely would go back even with the rough ride to the airport 
beautiful beach , terrible food we just stayed at the excellence for 5 nights while we definitely enjoyed the experience and found it incredibly relaxing , there were some negatives maybe we 're spoiled by the food in new york , but the food at the excellence was , for the most part , awful , in our opinion we found the only decent options were the asian restaurant and the pizza at the beach we also ate at the italian restaurant ( mushy pasta ) , the grill ( tough , overcooked chicken and instant mashed potatoes ) , and the french restaurant ( heavy sauces and fish overcooked to the point of being inedible ) all of the tables for two at the restaurants seem huge , which is odd when the place is so obviously trying to encourage intimacy in every other way and the music in the restaurants ( or the karaoke from the plaza ) is awful we decided to upgrade to the excellence club mostly for the availablility of snacks , since i had read some bad reviews of the food , but found the food there to be either bland or greasy , and the same exact spread every day that said , the excellence staff was very nice and helpful and we could not have asked for a more beautiful beach we got up early and snagged the canopy beds on the beach almost every day - - total heaven it is , however , very annoying when people claim spots in various places and do not use them if the food had been better , we might have gone back , but since that 's something that 's pretty important to us , i think next time we 'll try a different vacation destination 
amazing vacation just returned from a most amazing vacation with my boyfriend i read almost every review here before we booked this trip and i admit , i had some serious reservations after reading some reviews but i am so glad we did we had none of the issues that other travelers had first , everything in the room worked perfectly the room was cleaned and fridge restocked every day while we were at the beach we did have to ask for a new tv remote but it was brought to us that day we ordered room service twice and both times the meals were delivered in 30 minutes or less we had wonderful meals at each of the restaraunts , though not the caliber of the ritz carlton , we did remember we were in a 3rd world country and thought all of our meals were up to par though it was busy at the main restaraunt during breakfast hours , we found the waitstaff attentive and reasonably quick to deliver what we requested the pool staff was almost too diligent about bringing drinks to us and even offered us some special drinks that were not on the menu at one point i think they were bringing us new drinks before we finished the old ones though much of the staff did not speak english very well , which was a little frustrating to my boyfriend , they were always friendly and offered service with a smile this was the case for all of the staff at excellence the bartenders were not only friendly but entertaining and remembered what drinks we liked anything we asked for at excellence ( a safety pin , extra towels , etc ) we received neither of us got a single mosquito bite we loved the beach , though the waters were rough we still went in since the tide was low most of the time pizza delivery at 1:30 on the beach was such a treat we never had to go in for lunch all in all , excellence provided the most relaxing romantic vacation i 've ever had , and i 've traveled quite extensively and stayed at numerous five - star hotels 
heaven on earth we just returned from the excellence punta cana , our only regret about this resort was having to leave the staff was very professonal and extremly frendly hands down this is the best resort i have ever been to , and i 've been to a few we would like to extend our special thanks to the entertainment team , mariel , alexandra , ines , rosemary and andres , from the serving staff damigo and juan as these people treated us like family a very special thank you to maria and robert in the excellence club for making sure every detail of our stay was looked after and made sure we were having an excellant time ( and we did ) the hellicopter tour was worth every cent and the pilot is a pro there is one thing for sure we will be back steve and kathe moore alberta canada 
" excellente " holiday @ excellence punta cana having just returned from not just an excellent but an excellente holiday at this fantastic hotel  resort ( boo hoo i feel it necessary to comment on my stay and to compliment the excellent staff working at the hotel from start to finish the staff could not do enough for you , their warm , relaxed and natural personalities shone through ( even when the sun did not as the holiday progressed i became more impressed at the effort put in by all staff that i met special well dones and thank yous to everyone at the hotel for making my stay a very warm and relaxing one , i will be back  hopefully for 3 weeks next time when you visit the hotel be sure to pay a visit to the spa , the massages are fantastic , well worth the money  the spa itself is to die for if you 're into some seriously funny adult humour then be sure to pay the martini bar a visit and watch the dave richards ( pianist ) show if my memory serves me correctly the show is on a monday night after the main show and it 's definately one not to be missed relax and have a drink at the bar , i dare you to sing a song with him ask him if he 's finished the morcheeba cover of the song friction yet the resident entertainment team , all are fantastic are worth their weight in gold too funny people who genuinely give you the time of day ( even if they do give you the fright of your life by waking you up during an afternoon nap ) and night with the phrase of the holiday being 2000 people which there never will be you will be laughing at their efforts to get the beach volley , water volley etc on the go people to look out for on your holiday  who definately derserve a drink or two are : luciano ( ents manager ) , favourite phrase 2000 people ines ( mad macy gray hair ) the disco diva rosmery ( tacky tacky cd girl ) , julio ( the only dominican scotsman that you 'll ever meet ) , very funny guy carlos ( ow my teeth hurt ) , fab at his job and a top guy too juan - carlos ( j c ) , lovely nail varnish and he 's not guy andres ( dancing king ) , franklin ( little devil ) are real loveable , cheek squeezable guy wilkin (2nd in command ) keeps the sound  lights working , spins some tunes in the disco the outside acts are amazing dont miss out on the michael jackson show , the circus  the chris blizzard show all are fab , be sure to get a good seat food wise my fav restaurants were ( all of them ) the spice ( thanks to ramon ( head waiter ) ) ,  the french restaurant ( get there before 7pm to get a table all in all food and service is great also due a massive thank you is rafael puello ( sub director ) , again nothing is too much trouble , a real genuine guy who really cares about his customers and their enjoyment during their stay overall a fantastic holiday , wicked accommodation excellente staff , food to die for , service out of this world all served up by the warmest and nicest people i have ever met on holiday sarah ( from england but who lives in spain , malaga ) 
the best vacation of my life excellence was the best experience ever we only booked 5 nights ( as we 're always worried about staying too long ) but in this case , we wanted to stay longer i had a hard time adjusting to the real world again lolrooms : beautiful and so very clean the rooms were spacious and so very comfy and romantic pools : very clean and always tended to staff : great people almost everyone was super friendly ( people are entitled to their moments ) service : the staff (9 times out of 10) were very aware of our needs and made sure that we were always happy and taken care of food service areas : it was all yummy well , the lobster house smelled like fish - i had to leave lol great menu selections and they are take - out friendly it was nice to sit by the waves and eat room service was 24 hours a day it too was yummy , convenient and included beach : beautiful the service on the beach was constant and quick the bbqs on the beach were awesome too i was a little freaked to eat the food but no one died from it there were stomach issues from the pork ribs ( we think ) but a good cleaning never hurt anyone : - ) common area restrooms : they were always clean and always tended to resort : it 's small when compared to other places that i 've stayed but the entire place is clean , comfortable , safe and enough resort to get the job done activities : pools , beach , pool , table tennis , casino , off resort events , horseback riding and the list goes on crowd : it 's a mix of all ages not everyone there had a perfect body and that made it easier for those who have issues with their bodies airport shuttle service : great vehicles bumpy ride at times but so beautiful it was not too bad of a hike to/from the resort ** if you 're booking in a group , please be aware that we had a hard time with getting rooms together ( despite the fact that we booked like 8 months in advance ) and also seating at meals one woman always gave us a hard time about it she just did not want to help us she always had an excuse as to why she could not help us once my husband went to the front desk , the problem was solved the front desk was on the phone right away with the manager and the next thing ya know the impossible happened we actually got seated as a group anything is possible there if someone really wants to help you** 
loved the room and the location~but be aware of a potential problem this was my second trip to excellence hotel and as usual the road to the property was long and bumpy it is approximately an hour from the punta cana airport however , the location of the hotel is absolutely beautiful the beach and the property itself are maintained beautifully even after the rain they strive to clean up any standing water and pick up trash constantly the restaurants are excellent and the disco and the bars were great if you enjoy a drink with your vacation , be aware that they have premium alcohol available you will actually recognize the name of the alcohol that they use this is not your usual all inclusive with the same old buffet every meal and whatever well - liquor that they have on hand julio in entertainment was particularly attentive with my boyfriend and i on this trip and really made a great impression on us i suggest taking the time to get to know the people in the entertainment department i think it will make your trip better unfortunately , we were very disappointed and quite insulted by the behavior of one of the administrators of the hotel his name is miguel montanel we had an incident that turned out to be quite disturbing one night we were having a party on our terrace with some friends that we met at the hotel earlier we had called maintenence because the toilet kept running after it was flushed maintenence came to fix that and a light bulb while we were having a party with our new friends well , security must have misconstrued something , because suddenly we were being accused of supplying alcohol to their empolyees which did not happen ( and by the way it took a second trip by maintenence to finally get the toilet fixed ) my boyfriend was told by miguel montanel that he was not welcome back at the hotel ever whatever misinformation mr montanel had , we were never even given the benefit of the doubt i do not know what is going on with mr montanel , but maybe he should consider discussing a problem like this first with his employees because obviously he did not perhaps mr montanel believes that our money does not spend the same as others , because my boyfriend had worked at the hotel in the past and mr montanel feels that he has some superiority , where he does not perhaps his superiors need to advise him in respect , curtesy , and tact with paying guests i have never been so insulted in my life and if i never meet mr montanel it will be fine with me i will never return to this hotel and if you are considering going , be warned , do not call maintenence into your room when alcohol is present , as you may also find yourself in the same debasing predicament we found ourselves in apparently , this person feels he can be your judge and jury , without a chance to even defend yourself 
its all in the name we stayed at the excellence hotel for our honeymoon in february , we really did not know what to expect after reading some of the reviews on trip advisor , but have to say we could not find any fault with this hotel everythng that you could possibly think of and alot more was catered for the hotel was spotless and constantly being cleaned , the rooms where out of this world , spacious , clean and very comfortable the cleaner for our room (4010) went above and beyond what would be expected of her this hotel is outstanding in every way and everywhere you look you are amazed by the attention to detail , but one thing that really made our stay here excellant was the staff every member of staff was so friendly and could not do enough for us , from the bar staff and restaurant staff to even the staff working on the grounds they always had a smile and an hola when you walked by i find it hard to explain how brilliant the entertainment staff were , i ca not remember all of their names but julio , juan carlos , alexandria , ines , rosemary , mariel , carlos , andres and franklin to name a few really made our holiday what it was they always had some type of activity going on and became everyone 's friends they will get you involved or come and talk or dance with you and worked hard to make our stay special i would recommend this hotel and hope to visit again sometime 
perfect honeymoon just got back from staying at the excellence from feb 24- mar 1 booked through cheap tickets upon arriving , customs and getting backs took about 30 minutes we booked our transfer from the airport to the hotel separately we booked through dominican airport transfers after getting our bags , we walked to where tons of people holding up signs were standing we found our guy who had dominican airport transfers on his sign and he had our information with him if you do book w/ them , make sure you bring a confirmation sheet we were the only 2 people in the van all the way to the resort and all the way back to the airport when you leave they do not pick up anyone else , which could delay your trip the ride is 1 hour , with no stops we stopped once on the way , b/c our driver got us some dominican beers he was really cool they do drive crazy there do not worry about it you 've just gotta trust that they know what they 're doing and just enjoy the ride check in at the hotel was easy took about 10 minutes and we were up in our room we brought our marriage license to prove we were on our honeymoon , but they did not need to see it the honeymoon perks you get are : a breakfast in bed , a romantic dinner at any of the restaurants , and 15% off at the spa the room is nice , you get a jacuzzi and the minibar is full of soda and beer our room was cleaned everyday and the turn down service was done when we were not in the room the first night there , we ordered room service and relaxed the room service has a lot of good food , and we used it a few times they 're pretty quick depending on what time of the day you order breakfast time was the only time it took a while to get our food hanging out at the pool and beach are great there 's always someone walking around taking drink orders it takes about 10-20 minutes to get your drink , but if you want it quicker , i 'd suggest walking to the nearest bar to get it there are tons of different bars around the area you 'd only have to walk maybe a minute to find one wherever you are the pool has tons of floats the only problem around the resort , which is not the resort 's fault , is that everyone takes their towels and reserves a spot along the pool or beach for the next day this means that for the other people that do not do this , that there are no towels at all to use when you come to lay out i guess they do this at midnight or at 6 am or something we 'd come out to the pool/beach around 10am and there 's plenty of spots , but no towels b/c people take 4 or 5 of them for only 2 people this is retarded we found out that when you need a towel , the best place to look was at the smaller pool w/ the waterfall not as many people go to this pool either , and it has it 's own bar right next to it basically , when you 're on the resort , you can do as much or as little as you want there 's always a group of people playing a game like volleyball or horseshoes or whatever they give you a schedule of the day 's activities each night before the waves at the beach are not that bad just do not be an idiot and go out too far there are lifeguards that will yell at you if you go out too far you can book any expeditions you wanted to when you get to the resort there 's tons to choose from all the people to talk to about it are right near the front desk we did snorkeling one day and it was a lot of fun cost is about 78 bucks it takes about 45 minutes to drive out there b/c you have to pick up other people at other resorts you go out on this party boat and have drinks and food , snorkel around some coral reefs and then they take you to an area to snorkel w/ sharks and stingrays it 's a lot of fun , i thought it can get a little crowded depending on how many people go the other thing we did was golf the guy we talked to about golf said that there were a few courses around the resort the closest was punta blanca it 's about 30 minutes away from the excellence we did not play this one it looked to be a pretty flat course w/ not much around it he told us it 's an alright course costs about 160 bucks to play the next furthest course was white sands , i think we talked to some people that played it and said it was nice , but still under construction in some areas we ended up playing at la cana golf course it 's right near the airport , so it takes about an hour and 15 minutes to get out there the place is pretty nice they keep it in really nice condition you can have a caddy play w/ you if you want the cost is around 195 bucks they have 4 or 5 holes right along the carribean as well there 's about 10 bunkers on each hole too from what i could tell , it was one of the nicest courses around to play it did take up pretty much the whole day though if you 're looking to play golf , but want to do it quickly , i 'd just go to punta blanca they keep it in nice condition , but there 's not much to it the food was always good no matter where you went the only problem we had at a restaurant was one time when the service took forever that restaurant was agave 
our honeymoon at excellence i have been to the caribbean several time and this was my husband 's first trip as well as our honeymoon so we wanted to stay somewhere we would remember at the advise of our travel agent we booked with excellence from february 25th until march 2nd we arrived in punta cana around 5pm and it took about 45 mins to go through customs and get our luggage we paid $36 to have a private transfer to excellence and it was well worth it we talked with our driver who was very nice and even asked him to turn on his favorite music the music was a nice touch while taking in the scenery since i used trip advisor to prepare for our stay , i knew the ride would take about an hour and would be somewhat bumpy i thought it would be worse , maybe they have made some improvements cars and motorbikes will pass you on the right even with oncoming traffic and cut you off in a second , so you will hold your breathe a few times we arrived at excellence around 7pm and were greeted with cold champagne and a damp towel check - in went smoothly and the bellhop escorted us to our room waiting in our room was a chilled bottle of champagne and a fruit basket ( out travel agent advised the hotel it was our honeymoon ) the room was a little warm so we turned on the ac and unpacked our bags when we came back from dinner , the room was still a little warm so we called maintenance and they were there within moments the guy did something and told us it would continue to get cooler we woke up the next morning in a sweat and called maintenance again once again they were there promptly and did and told us the same thing we left and went to breakfast and when we returned the room was still warm we went to the front desk and asked for a room change and morales granted one with no questions asked the service was excellente morales even called housekeeping to make sure the room would be clean i asked him for a honeymooners banner to put on the door and we had one within an hour to make a long story longer , you can not beat the customer service that you will receive now a days , good service is hard to come by but excellence must train their staff very well in the middle of our stay , took an excursion to sanoa island it was a full day and we were exhausted when we returned but i would do it all over again the dominicans really know how to have fun we played drinking games on the natural sandbar and i even got to hold a star fish once at the island , they cooked lunch for us it was buffet style and really good , the bar was all inclusive as well we took a speed boat to the island but returned on a catamaran - so relaxing we did the horseback riding at the hotel which was a lot of fun my husband rode concrete which the guide advised was the best horse - make sure to ask for concrete my horse on the other hand was slow , but i have never ridden a horse without a guide holding the raines , so i was happy to have the slowest one we alternated days at the pool and beach just as the other reviews stated , you have to get out early to get a premium spot we were not concerned about having to reserve a chair and we always found one if you a picky , i would suggest following the crowd but beware because people do get fustrated and will take chairs that were reserved honestly , i do not blame them because while at the beach for 3 hours , i never saw the people that reserved their chair by mine finding a chair or a bed at the pool was never hard one thing i had not seen on any review was what to do with your towel when you are done at the beach or pool excellence has these black colored pompeson - type circles that you discard your towels in dinner was always great if you did not like something , you could always order something else do not be shy because the waitstaff is attentive and will ask how everything is after dinner , we went back to the room and changed ( my husband and i are more laid back people than dressy people ) and would go have after dinner cocktails at kafe cafe braulio was great and never made me feel bad about my broken spanish but would help me find the word i was looking for braulio was the main reason we went to kafe cafe we watched a couple shows - michael jackson is a must see you feel as though you are at a michael jackson concert we never went to the night club but used our mini bar in the room instead you must go buy from nancy in hut 6 to the left of the resort she will not haggle you and will offer you some mamajuana while shopping her prices are the lowest overall , it was a great experience for our honeymoon and i enjoyed the luxury of the hotel if you want the total experience of being pampered , i would suggest to stay at excellence the only downside was we felt s little on the young side and we are both 27 years old 
fantasy island my wife and i just returned fron our dream vacation ( feb23-29) at excellence punta cana everything we wished for and more was experienced upon arrival at the beautiful , clean puj airport we found it to be calm and organized with a delightful breeze blowing throughout the building it did not take us long to clear customs and get our luggage once outside we found our bus that would take us to the hotel the ride took us about an hour and was quite bumpy on some sections of the road , but we enjoyed it and it became a sight seeing tour we drove through a few small towns and saw what dwellings most people lived in a real culture lesson when we arrived at the hotel we received a cool towel and glass of champagne check in was very smooth we asked the desk clerk for an upgrade from our garden view room to a pool view we were very happy to be accomadated and he graciously accepted our tip our room in building #6 was beautiful , clean , and spacious with a balcony overlooking the huge pool and swim up bar the refrig was stocked everyday with plenty of beer , water , and soda also a bottle of champagne and wine on ocassion there was a nice mix of guests all ages mostly from canada , america and some europeans the grounds , pools and beach were all kept immaculate no seaweed at all on the soft sandy beach the ocean 's water was gorgeous and crystal clear we enjoyed the sound of the waves crashing on the shore a refreshing breeze off the ocean made sunbathing comfortable there was no problem claiming a lounge chair if you were out on the beach by 10:30a we also found plenty of towels located on various racks by pools and beach the weather was excellent mostly sunny everyday with some brief passing clouds that were welcome the temperature was in the low 80's during the day and the low70's at night only a brief shower one day we choose not to use our ac , we chose to open the balcony door and let in the ocean 's refreshing breeze there were no bugs or flies to speak of the food was very good with a variety to pick from it would be impossible not to find something you did not like breakfast was either sit down at the lobster house or buffet style at the toscana at lunch time you could eat inside at the grill or at the beach where there were specials of the day such things as hamburgers , chicken , hot dogs and local specialities prepared on the beach individuals pizzas were also passed out on the beach there were many varieties of restaurants for dinner we had no problems getting served quickly and most meals were delicious the entertainment each night was very enjoyable something that all ages could find entertaining many bars were open with great tasting drinks made to your liking beach service was unbelievable with beach specials served each day we found the best bar to be cafe kafe hats off to pedro for his special efforts yeah 'sammy sosa ( drink ) most help was very friendly and appreciated a well deserved tip  we will most definatley return for another dream vacation at excellence on this fantasy island 
great people we arrived saturday night 2/23 after a long day of travelling with only crackers and peanut butter to sustain us we were starved and were thoughtfully led by vincent to the oregano ( outdoor pizza ) restaurant where we were greated by lizette she sat us down and got us drinks her boss sent us ( unasked ) a welcoming platter of natchos while we waited for our pizza the lights went out so lizette lit candles and set the tone and ambiance by saying playfully , very romantic we relaxed , enjoyed the natchos and the pizza arrived in good time lizette and her boss ( sorry i did not get the name ) are masters of hospitality and serve excellence with distinction our room was very well appointed but the ac never worked full on when the sliding door was closed and locked we enjoyed keeping the sliding door open and drifting off to sleep with the sound of the surf maintenance changed our light fixtures and fixed the scale in a timely manner we asked for a do not disturb card but that never arrived even after pantomiming to the housekeeper the language barrier poses some challenges but is not totally insurmountable the food was ok to very good there is usually something to select that you can enjoy the wait staff were mostly attentive and we tipped generously for their service the surf was as described very rough with riptides my husband was tossed about and was more frightened than ever in his life he did not go back in but we walked the beach together we met some wonderful people ( staff and guests ) and enjoyed their company and conversation highlights were domingo and raphael ( sax and keyboard ) playing in the plaza , the pool , sun , breeze , ice cream machine at kafe cafe and the people spanish lessons with juan carlos , playing farkle with altagracia and hanging out with denise and john from liverpool ( enjoy turkey in september - we 'll be thinking of you negatives were the frequent loss of electricity and water causing the public toilets to get really nasty ( flushing them frequently with sea water would be a step in the right direction to insure public health and the esthetics of the resort ) also , the lobster house had a sewage vs bad fish ( we never ate there and wondered whether the diners there noticed it this was a most relaxing vacation and my bp has been normal since i returned afterglow i guess 
ca not wait to return we stayed at excellence feb 21 - feb the entire stay was excelente upon our arrival at the airport we immediately found our vip driver awaiting us he greeted us with and enthusiastic ole and a big smile the drive to the resort although long ( about an hour ) was very comfortable yes the driving was different than we are used to in the states but we got used to it our arrival at excellence was handled very quickly and to our surprise we were upgraded to an ocean view/swim up room we arrived at noon so we went to have lunch and a drink while our room was being cleaned , not a big deal because we already knew that check - in time was 3 pm within an hour our room was ready and our luggage already in the room the room ( #14002) was spacious , very clean and well stocked with everything from towels to bottled water by 1:30 pm we were lounging outside of our room at the magnificient pool and juan made sure we wanted for nothing the food at all the restaurants was very good but do not expect it to be prepared like you do it at home , after all , you are not at home we never went hungry and the toscana italian was our favorite i celebrated my birthday while there and everywhere we went people were saying happy birthday to me i can not think of a single negative thing to say about the excellence and it 's staff we would like to send a special thanks to fabio , jose , and juan the three of you helped to make our stay one to remember if you can take an excursion , the saona island and the bavaros tours were something we will never forget all i can say is once you arrive at the excellence sit back , relax , and enjoy being pampered because check out comes faster than you think 
relaxing and fun , great customer service it was our first time at the excellence resort in punta cana we were greeted upon our arrival with a refreshing drink and fresh fruit it was a welcoming enviroment and we were directed to our room where our luggage arrived moments later our view was fantastic with the pool and a large tree with baby coconuts on it and the mountains in the background everything was clean and well maintained anytime we needed something there was someone nearby that had an answer or took care of our needs we enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink while we were there the drink of the day was brought out to us by the pool or if i chose to drink something else it was brought to us very promptly the sun and clouds and breeze and warm temperatures were perfect for relaxing the beach was perfect every morning , fresh towels were available on the beach and at the pool the cabana 's , lounge chairs , and hammocks were always fresh every morning wilkens took charge of taking care of our group and was very dedicated in making sure that we were all equally treated well his energetic attitude and smile were always welcoming and inviting i look forward to seeing his wonderful smile again next year overall the resort and trip were as they say excellente ' 
hated to leave i just came back from a stay at excellence with my best friend i was so sad to leave that i 'm already plotting my return we spent 4 days lounging and eating , drinking and dancing the food was not the best in the world , but there was always something tasty to satisfy us the spa was lovely - - i had a massage we also rode the horses , which was really fun the staff were amazing i 'm terrible with names but i remember and appreciate the smiles and energy of ines and luciano and juan jose , at the hot dog stand special thanks to joel delgado on the entertainment staff we were two single ladies in a sea of couples , so i appreciated them dancing with us or just stopping by to chat my only complaints were with our room , which was very dark even in the middle of the day i found it tough to read anything and the bed was a hard as a rock however , it was very clean and frequently serviced excellence punta cana is the ultimate in luxury and relaxation it is not a place for singles on the prowl , but if you 're just looking to have a good time with friends , look no further 
the rating is spot on it is rated 4 1/2 stars and it is about right we stayed one week end of february the weather was unsettled , but when the sun was shinning the breeze made the heat very comfortable the hotel is big and at first glance we thought too big but you do get use to the layout and in fact people scatter all around the place and it is not crowded - except in the evening when the show is on the choice of 7 restaurants is great being french i like my food and must say that in all the restaurants the quality was good even the wine , which can be a bit mediocre when it is all in , was very pleasant i was disappointed with the cocktails they are all prepared with commercial juices rather than using fresh fruit - obviously a cost thing , but they do not taste anyting like the cocktails you get in 5 stars hotels the sea is quiet rough , so not a paradise for keen swimmers the beach is nice and long and you can go for over an hour walk each way the pool is very adequate the beds on the beach are very good and comfortable , but it is a challange to get one as everybody seem to be up at 7 in the morning to reserve their ( s ) i put an s because some reserve beds around the pool as well as on the beach , even that they cant lay on both at the same time we had a room with a double balcony and it was nice and roomy it did smell a bit damp , perhaps because the jaccuzi is in the middle of the room i dont know what they thought we might drink , but the 5 bottles of gin , whiskey , vodka etc in our bedroom did not get touch there was plenty to be had at the 11 bars of the hotel the spa was very nice overall , a good holiday and i do recomment booking the excellence club , it really adds a touch of luxury to the holiday the food in the excellence club lounge was very good with breakfast , lunch and dinner served there and snacks thourought the day 
my husband and i celebrated our first wedding anniversary at the excellence resort in punta cana and what a fantastic vacation we booked the trip through our travel agent and subsequently contacted the hotel to make anniversary arrangements the head concierge leticia ramirez was more than accomodating and was very helpful in reserving all the little extras that come with an anniversary package i also booked a beachfront dinner - $150 even though the food is the same that you can get at chez isabelle and the lobster house , it 's worth the romantic experience the ride from the airport was lengthy but fairly enjoyable and , oh yes - they fixed the road , so there may have been a couple of bumps but nothing to worry about our room was on the ground floor in building 11, only a few steps from the far end of the enormous pool we had champagne and fruits upon arrival everything in the room was functional and just as described in the brochure , one small downside upon arrival - the air conditioning did not work when we got in but it was fixed within 20 minutes , so no problems there we did not have many issues with getting dinner at any restarant and this is while the resort was almost full ( valentine 's day into president 's day weekend ) the longest wait was at chez isabelle - about an hour and a half but once we got in , the service was quick and the food was ready within minutes food - very good , we enjoyed all restaurants i would not order sushi at spice , keep in mind , you are not in japan drinks were fairly strong and plentiful we especially enjoyed being able to have jackcoke in the morning : ) also , the house white wine is very good i was pleasantly surprised and my husband said the red was good as well a note on the pool situation - the hotel allows you as many towels as you can carry , none of those annoying towel cards - the staff distributes neatly rolled towels on every beach chair and every bed in the morning however , some guests still ca not get enough and take 5 towels at a time which creates a situation that many reviews talk about - the shortage of towels and chairs however , we were always able to get towels at the front desk if none were available outside we had to use the if you ca not beat them , join them strategy with the beach chairs - just throw your towel on the beach chair on your way to breakfast and it 's yours for the day the staff was exceptional we never had to wait for a drink we tipped all around and got the towel art from hosekeeping and all the extras we wanted room service was good as well but always seemed to forget something small from our order - again , no big deal we took an excursion to saona island - very nice , it allows you to experience the carribean waters vs the atlantic at excellence one piece of advice - do not purchase lobster on this excursion , you can have it for free at the hotel and it 's good do look into the cigar museum , they have a fairly large selection only unpleasant thing happened during our stay - we ran out of cold water the day before we left which caused the toilets to stop flushing and then the hot water finished as well this happened during the day and lasted for about 8 hours and the problem was throughout the hotel the housekeeping in common areas kept on pouring water in the toilets after every use to flush them but you really could not use your own shower or bathroom this is nothing that ruined our stay but i think for the amount of money spent on this hotel - totally unacceptable we also experienced a couple of power outages which were very short - 5 minutes tops overall , this vacation was as relaxing and romantic as it could have been and we are looking to experience excellence in mexico as well the resort provided entertainment which was good and you could choose to do something at all times or nothing at all , just refer to the letter that is left at turndown they had live music on the beach for honeymooners and anniversary couples , piano bar , shows , dancing , ethnic food nights , cooking lessons we enjoyed ourselves and each others company , so none of the little issues were a big deal but if you are an extremely picky person , some of these little things could ruin your vacation we would recommend this hotel to anyone and this has definitely been one of the best vacations of our lives have fun if you go 
10 year wedding anniversary dream what a dream from beginning to end the trip was amazing my husband and i celebrated our 10th anniversary and could not have asked for a better place to stay we upgraded to the excellence club and thought it was well worth the money we were swept away as soon as we got there to the private check in and were treated like a king and queen the entire stay everyone was very friendly and more than willing to make sure you are having a good time we went to relax ( having two kids at home ) and not have any drama there are two separate sections of the large pool and we stayed on the quiet side away from the main lobby peace and quiet as you sit and are served by the wonderful staff the beach was nice but the waves were a little rough the best part of the trip definately having dinner on the beach they truly cater to you and make the whole experience wonderful again , the staff was very friendly and helpful , the rooms were spacious , the excellence club was well worth the money , the pool and the beach were clean and is was wonderful to kick back and get served at the beach and pool side with drinks and pizza the restaurants were good every night they had a couple closed because of upgrades to the hotel but there are still enough to choose from ( the japanese one was excellente 
mixed reviews stayed at excellence end of nov through beginning of dec in '07 for our honeymoon overall really enjoyed excellence , however , some little things that could be improved upon i will break it into categories since this is the best way to keep me from rambling transfer from airport to hotel : i do not get motion sick at all , so this trip really did not bother me too much , although after a long flight the last thing we really wanted was another 1hr drive to get to our destination - however , we knew about this prior to coming and it was not too bad roads are very bumpy though and this drive really gives you a taste of the poverty in the dominican arrival : very nice grounds upon arrival hotel is beautifully maintained greeted with champagne and a cool towel - very nice touch staff was very friendly check - in was a breeze , although the language barrier was a little bit of an issue we were sent to our room in the 7th i actually do not remember now for sure room : loved the room until a couple of the nights we woke up to find little ants in bed with us ( how romantic ) called to get the room sprayed which they did not take care of all that promptly i think part of that problem was the language barrier i finally found one of the guys who brought us room service and showed him what we were talking about , and eventually they came in to spray never had the ants with us in bed again , just near the balcony did not ruin our vacation by any means , but was not exactly a pleasant thing to wake up to rooms were very spacious loved the daily stocked mini bar included with the cost - the guy who filled ours daily was very nice , and any request we had , he always at least tried to fulfill it jacuzzi tub was nice separate shower was nice , minus the weak water pressure ( which actually i appreciated at the end of the week when i was burnt ) my biggest complaint was the bed - and i know i sound really petty when i say that - but i am one of those people that could sleep on the floor and get a great night 's rest , but this bed was awful it was probably the most rock - hard bed i have ever slept on both my husband and myself woke up with sore backs many nights from that bed again , not a vacation - ruiner , but just something that could be improved upon on a more positive note , our room view was fabulous - direct view of the ocean , and directly next to the swim - up bar a/c worked great once we figured out that it shuts off if you have the sliding glass door open overall a nice room on a side note , the daily maid service was not consistent expect to be interrupted at any hour of the day ( up to 5pm in our case ) for them to clean i actually found the turn - down service at night much more consistent they did a great job beach : personally , this was the most disappointing aspect of the trip for me i am a beach - a - holic i have been to many beautiful beaches all over the caribbean for me , this beach was not impressive at all the waves were very rough , to the point where we went in maybe twice ( and i used to be a lifeguard ) however , i know this was a complaint of many people , and you either have to deal with it , or take a tour somewhere on the caribbean side to get your calm beach fix ( which is what we did ) the other thing i noticed was that it was extremely windy there maybe it was just the time of year/the week we were down there , but it was noticeably windy again , nothing reflecting on the resort itself , just my opinion of the beach itself plenty of chairs around the beach , however great attentiveness when it came to staff bringing drinks to people out on the beach next time we take a trip , however , we will be venturing to the caribbean side service : overall , phenomenal staff you really ca not ask for more energetic , friendly , kind , attentive staff than that of the staff at excellence i will say , however , that if you dont want to participate in an activity , such as beach volleyball , karaoke , etc do not be in that general area when it is going on many times the staff tried to get me to join these activities , when all i really wanted to do was relax or just watch my husband participate , and they seemed rather pushy , not taking a simple no thank you as an answer maybe that was just my experience , but i really did not appreciate it and yes , i do realize it is their job to get everyone involved , but i also believe they should respect the wishes of those who really dont want to participate food : overall , i would rate the food a 7/10 primarily did room service for breakfast - which was decent lunch options were limited , as you have to be appropriately dressed to get a meal at the grill and toscana when you are in your bathing suit all day and just want a quick burger , you really dont feel like going inside to change into nicer clothes just me , but i wish the dress code was not quite so rigid for lunch there was the option of going to the lobster house ( which was about a 45 min wait for a burger and nachos ) , or the beach bbq , which we tried once and loved it the grill was excellent , in our opinions , for both lunch and dinner had our honeymoon dinner at spice , which was good chez isabelle was great , but i had no clue what half of the food was just ask the waiter for their recommendation and go with it unfortunately , the chocolate martini i had was a bit strong , so dinner at tuscana was cut short never tried the lobster house for dinner i dont remember what i even had at barcelona , so it was probably good i wish the resort had a beach side bar that served more snacks/quick meals also be prepared for slower service , which i expected prior to coming , but when staff are just standing around talking to one another rather than asking you what you want to drink or taking your order it just seems as though they could improve upon that pool and bar : wonderful pool sometimes we had difficulty finding pool floats , but it was not too long before a couple gave theirs up but overall , awesome , awesome pool lots of activities for those that want to get involved we never tried the pool with the waterfall in it , but walked by it and it looked very quiet and relaxing beach/pool bars were both excellent 
anybody that thinks this is a 5 star place must give motel 6's 4 stars this review was not just my opinion but at least 2 other couples we spoke to while we were there the bad : to start our own travel agent said you 'll never go back to sandals after staying here well she will also be getting an ear full today after arriving at 4pm ( check in is at 3) we had to wait 1 hour and 15 min for our room the rooms are nice size day 2 - no power and water for 2 hours day3- no water for 6 hours gross , no one could wash hands , flush tiolets etc in fact people were using the hotel lobby bathrooms because the help were flushing the tiolets with the water out of the fish pond day4 no power and water in the morning i understand things happen during the day3 incedent i said something to the front desk i got sorry at least 200 times but i let it go the front desk person caught me a little while later and said sir we have water again on that bit of good news i ran to the room to enjoy a shower still no water went back down to the desk and was told sorry at least another 200 times i could get into many more details of this vacation but im really only hitting the highlights this place is not worth the price the food was fair at best if you got it , the one night we waited 1 and 1/2 hours for dinner , only to wait another 1 and 1/2 hours to be served my wife the wrong food and i only got half of my order the good : very well maintained and beautiful groundsthe worst : the place was only about half full when we arrived on a thursday apperently every other hotel is over booked they end up sending there guests to the excellence italked to 2 couples and both went threw the same thing there hotel stay was $200 a night , while the excellence is like $300 a night since there hotel was overbooked , there hotel refunded $200 a night since there vacation was for 6 nights they got $1200 in cash at the same time there hotel puts them up ( pays ) for them to stay at the excellence basically they paid for airfare and got to stay at a better hotel than they booked these people made up the other half of the hotel which inturn fills the excellence to capacity now they get a free vacation , while i paid full fare plus i have to wait in longer lines at all the meals , never get a decent spot at the pool or beach this was just the icing on the cake to sum it up : stay at a lower class hotel that is closer to the airport ( less travel time wasted ) because it is not that much lower class than the excellence and if your lucky they will be overbooked and you will get your vacation paid for while still staying at the excellence either way do not book a trip there , your just throwing your money down the tiolet ( i 'm sure it will be working then ) ps i cant wait to go back to sandals ( any location ) 
loved excellence , punta cana what a perfect name for this resort i would rate it excellent in every way my husband and i especially enjoyed domingo the sax player that was there every night , he was fantastic everyone who works there goes out of their way to say hola , and to make sure you have everything you could ever need this resort is so beautiful and clean , it was unbealivable we definately want to go back some day 
aviod this place my husband and i are currently staying here at the excellence punta cana if you are thinking about coming here please think twice the place is very beautiful and the beach is great however , there have been problems which are absolutly unacceptable for such a highly rated resort we have been here for five days at this point and have lost electricity for several hours and have also had no water yes , no water that means no showers or toilets that work in the entire resort the first time we lost water it lasted at least nine hours the second time about three it made us wonder what the staff was doing in terms of sanitary conditions when it came to food and drink prep needless to say we have not been very happy with the trip we also spent the extra money for the excellence club and that was also a waste of money while they do provide a club house for your use that is about the only perk they promise immediate check - in , which did not happen for us we still had to wait for our room and even then had to argue to get the room we paid for they also say that there is a private beach for those in the excellence club but it is not enforced and it is very difficult to get a chair on the beach unless you get out there by 9:00 am it is no different than any other resort we were also told that the excellence club members get to make reservations at the different restaurants which is not true usually one has to wait about an hour to eat unless you get there right at 6 pm when the place opens one night they had three of the restuarants closed because they were having a beach party unfortunately it rained so every one in the resort tried to have dinner in the remaining open restaurants we did not eat until almost 10 that night and did not have a full menu to choose from - - they had run out of some of the entrees some of the restuarants turned people away saying they did not have the space or the food to accomodate any more guests so if even after reading this review you still decide to take a chance and come to excellence punta cana do not pay the extra for the excellence club you will be dissappointed better yet do not come here at all - - you are likely to have a better stay elsewhere we still have two days here and are hoping for them to be uneventful which would make the end of the trip at least acceptable 
excellente ' my wife and i had the pleasure of staying at your resort from feb 10 to feb 16 and we enjoyed every minute of it you should take pride in the establishment you have the food - fabulous , drinks - fabulous , entertainment - awesome the one thing i noticed is from the time we arrived we always felt welcome , we never treated like an outsider as tourists sometimes are during our stay we met many people , workers as well as other vacationers i would like to give a special thanks to julio , joel delgado , inez  alexandria they are some very valuable employees you have and should take pride in them all of your staff was very courteous and friendly , i wish i would have gotten all of there names one last note is : take great pride in your establishment and your employees because it is something to be proud of thank you for the memories 
all inclusive honeymoon dream my new husband and i just returned from a 7 night stay at excellence , and it was excellent there are a few minor set backs , but nothing that can not be dealt with beach/pools : the beach was wonderful , with palm trees , tiki huts , lay out matresses , and canopied beds the pools were equally as nice with plenty of places to lay out and enjoy the nice clean water guests can find nice quiet pockets to relax in , or mingle with other guests and enjoy a social experience helpful note for all newcomers : you must wake up early to reserve the premiere spots at the beach or pool guests will mark their spots as early at 7am if not , you will still find a spot , but not the top locations we enjoyed the nice variety of food offered , and did not have many meals we did not like our favorite restaraunt was 'spice '  'barcelona ' , and the least favorite was 'the grill ' we never ate at lobster house or chez isabelle the buffet lunch at toscana is always a delicious bet , and room service food is good as well oh , and the pizza 's that are delivered poolside are wonderful service : everyone had a very cheery disposition and were always quick to say 'hola ' or 'excellente ' there were some communication barriers at times though for instance missed wake up calls , us not getting everything in our honeymoon package until persistent calling and following up ( that was annoying ) however , room service and the 'excellence club ' was great at the end of the day , patience is required , but they are friendly and quick staff bars : great drinks and excellent service ask for a sammie sosa : ) also , be sure to ask for some 'mama wanna ' , as well ( i believe the stuff is illegal in the states ) **also , do not forget to request your liquor of choice they have all of the premium liquors available and they have very 'generous portions ) activities : we were told to avoid the dolphin experience , because it is not good in the dominican republic i dread to think what that means , but i did not want to spend the rest of my trip crying and trying to 'save the dolphins ' we enjoyed our 1 hour horse back ride a lot it was worth the extra 30minutes also , another honeymooning couple went to saona island and loved it it is a hefty drive out there , but the pictures and big conch shells they brought home seemed worth the trip hope that helps we had a great time 
excellence punta cana is great excellent facilities and service we liked the food in all of the restaraunts the staff all over provided good service however the entertainment group franklin , carlos , andres , inez , alagratia , and others were even better the beach is very good for walking however the water was often too rough for swimming in the ocean 
very enjoyable vacation the reviewers : bob , 58, and sharon , 48, american , well traveled in the caribbean , mexico , costa rica , asia - pac adventurous souls interested in new experiences , cultures , food , fishing , boating appreciate the lap of luxury , but equally excited roughing it in fly - in camps in northern ontario or tiny fishing villages on mexico?? pacific coast extremely limited grasp of the spanish language , but willing to make an effort arrival , departure , and transfers , punta cana airport / excellence : among the easiest we??e ever experienced breezed through customs on arrival , $10 visa fee apiece , porters aggressive but manageable contacted the resort in advance to arrange a taxi , driver was waiting with a sign seventy five minutes , sixty bucks and a ten dollar tip later arrived at excellence the drive nothing to worry about , slaloming through the potholes , application of the horn as an occasional navigational aid , all fairly standard in our experience you never really get going all that fast certainly less of an adventure than using a twenty to motivate a nyc cabbie to get you to jfk in time for your flight departure at the airport was similar , waved right on through no requests for any sort of exit fee got to the pc airport two hours early to allow for whatever we figured we had to allow for , sat at the gate and cooled our heels for an hour and a half before boarding for home way easier than the typical confusion in , for example , mexico city first impressions and check in : the initial impression of the place suggests ??nderstated elegance? not a lot of screaming opulence or showy heel - clicking , but the large , open lobby and manicured grounds clearly exude quality and the staff appear committed to customer service the guy who unloaded our duffels couldn?? find our name on his list of the day?? check - in?? ( i had confirmed our room a couple weeks earlier ) , but left us with the impression that it wasn?? a problem and yes , they give you a little flute of champagne at the front desk , we produced our credentials and the staffer disappeared momentarily , then reappeared , saying , ??lease step into my office whereupon we slid down to a more private area of the front desk we were then informed that the staffer was hoping to ??pgrade us to a higher quality room? and hinted that , if we were so inclined , he might be able to ??xtend us this courtesy? i replied that i was sure we could work something out he disappeared again not being ??oom? we had booked the el cheapo garden view room , and at this point it was obvious to me that they?? given all of those away we were going to be upgraded , and our friend at the desk was hoping to make something off the deal he returned , saying , ?? am going to do something nice for you , and perhaps you can do something nice for me he went on to explain that we would be in one of the walk - out pool - front rooms i appreciated the entrepreneurial spirit , and had anticipated it , folding a twenty into my hand i smiled , palmed him the bill , and everyone was happy no one explained the excellence club program or tried to encourage us to sign up , fine because we?? decided that wasn?? for us we fell in behind the bellman and headed for our casa the room : we landed in 6001, which turned out to be the closest walk - out to the swim - up bar , an obvious advantage the bellman gave us the rundown , explained how to use the safe , graciously accepted his tip the room and its furnishings looked recently updated , and indeed during the course of the week we saw new cabinetry that matched ours being moved into several rooms we checked out all the equipment to make sure everything was working , the only flaw being that the screen on the sliding door was too short for the opening and would fall off unless closed all the way no problem , we unpacked everything was clean and in order , the room spacious , the shower had great pressure and volume , two - person jetted tub separating bed and vanity area vanity had a single sink , a double would have been more convenient , but since we were never in a hurry no big deal the bed was about what we have come to expect in mexico , meaning beyond firm to hard , but manageable being off of a corner of the pool , the room had a slightly larger than average grassy area beyond the small patio , which included two comfortable chairs and a table like other pool - fronts , we had a hammock despite it?? proximity to the swim - up bar , the room was not noisy at the times we were there , and since that bar closes at 6 p , no problems in the evening the location is close to the central hub of activity surrounding the lobby , so very convenient a bit of a walk to the beach , but nothing important the grounds : beautifully landscaped , impeccably maintained the larger pool meanders over most of the length of the resort , between the buildings and the beach , it?? unique and beautiful there are only a couple places where bridges cross , so it takes a bit of orientation to figure out your shortest route to get from point a to b pool and ocean water temperature seem pretty similar , i?? guess around 80 lots of lounges , beds , and floats , all in good condition never had a problem establishing a beach head other than the swim up bar after we?? finished up at the beach , we didn?? use the pool adjacent to the drive coming in there is a small ecological park with gardens and a jogging track this is worth a walk through , as the gardens are quite nice and you will find peacocks , wild turkeys , chickens , parrots , and all manor of bird life hanging out there during our entire stay , we saw but a single mosquito the beach : the beach is long , wide , and you won?? find a scrap of trash numerous palapas to duck under during the one or two minute sprinkles that occurred on a few days lots of beds and lounge chairs some have described the sand as darker than the whiter caribbean beaches yes , it is slightly darker , but pure and without rocks , shells , or other debris , a joy to walk in because of the resort?? remote location , you can trek as far as you wish in either direction without encountering another resort there were significant breakers each day , fun to swim in if you like that sort of thing , which i do in addition to the tidal surf , the wind was up each day , so there was a lot of wind - driven waves as well i didn?? find any rocks or debris in the water , just a nice sandy bottom the best rips for body surfing or boarding were at the right edge of the property ( as you are facing the ocean ) i did not find the water threatening , and there were always a couple guards on duty , whistling in those who were thought to be too far out the low - rise architecture of the resort , together with the palms in front , makes the resort almost non - existent when you are on the beach , adding to the beach experience exiting the property on the beach , both right and left , you will find a few vendors who will try to hawk you into there little shacks , but certainly no more aggressive than mexico , they will take no for an answer for those to whom such things matter , topless women were frequently in evidence the facilities , activities and entertainment : other than excursions , we spent most of our days on the beach , thus did not do things like tennis , horseback riding , pool games , etc saw some of that going on , and the staff appeared to work hard to encourage participation and make sure those engaged were having fun the bars we frequented were kafe caf? ( at the pool ) , martini ( off the lobby ) , swim up , and the long bar which runs adjacent to the theater area the theater area , where the evening shows take place , is pretty neat , with comfortable couches provided to watch the entertainment all the bars had a nice ambience , and were good places to chat up other guests or the bartenders service was prompt and selection was very good no , you won?? find single malt scotch , but the johnnie walker , bombay sapphire , jack daniels , absolut , several cognacs , etc 
definately better than i expected stayed at excellence jan 17-24 2008 must admit i was a little sceptic hearing negative and posative reviews however , in the end i was very pleased the grounds itself are large and very well kept the rooms are pretty and have their own jacuzzi they are kept pretty clean on a daily basis the pools are large and kept very clean as well the restaurants is what i was mostly worried about however , i was very pleased with all of them you have a nice variety of international foods i want to say chez isabell the french was my favorite in the afternoons they do lunch on the beach and it was always excellent did not love the breakfast buffet at toscana if you are worried about being bored there are a ton of activities to keep you busy entertainment at night 10 pm at the theater was fun afterwards there is one club can get repetative but it was always fun to be able to have an option the staff is great friendly and fun thanks to kenny , carlos and rey would definately come back overall , a nice all inclusive adults only resort 
my fiance and i went to dr in may 2007 the trip was very long from the airport , but the scenic view is amazing the resort is clean , new and beautiful the food was ok , our room was beautiful we loved the lazy river , and the swim up bar the best part of our vacation was the excursion to saona island we took a bus through dr and took a catamaran trip to the beautiful island of saona island this is were they filmed the movie blue lagoon we had an amazing time , and we met really cool people from different resorts we also took an off road excursion that was really cool we drove a quad through local towns and to an amazing cave 
absolutely loved this resort we stayed at excellence from feb 3 through feb this was our first time to punta cana but have stayed at many other all inclusives in the caribbean , usually in jamaica or mexico we 've been to several sandals resorts , couples , secrets capri in riviera maya and the riu 's in jamaica as well as the caves and sunset at the palms we flew us air from philly and had an uneventful early flight we did not have ground transfers included in our rate with orbitz but getting a taxi at the airport was a breeze and before we knew it we were on our way to the resort the airport in punta cana is an easy experience on arrival and not a typical airport , its an open air series of thatched huts very lovely in design and appears to be newly built , however getting out of there was somewhat difficult possibly because of understaffing however , both our flights were on time the ride from the airport to the resort was not really that bad , quite bumpy but only about an hour long and not much traffic we were placed in a room we did not like to start with but upon checking back at the front desk , were moved to a lovely cascade pool view on the third floor pauline at the front desk was very helpful and a pleasure we had only booked a garden view and i believe because this was available , and we asked , we got a complimentary upgrade which may be something that 's not always an option the staff at toscana which is the primary restaurant for breakfast and lunch is incredible we encountered several exceptional wait staff santos and adan who were extremely helpful the staff in this restaurant and in barcelona which is connected to it is there all day long and are always pleasant and always cheerful no matter what meal you are having they did everything possible to meet your needs and one in particular did not stop , her name is lucy and she seemed to always be there whenever we were even the supervisory staff was just as attentive to the guests as the wait staff if they saw something you needed , they took care of it for you our room was cleaned every day and we had little extras at different times we never had any issues with lack of hot water it was very spacious and had an oversized jacuzzi bathtub as well as a separate shower there was a small seating area and because we were on the third floor , we had a very nice vauted ceiling we only had room service once for breakfast which was promptly delivered but missing an item or 2 there are many opportunities to eat in the resort so we felt it was not really necessary the concierge desk called on our second day to make sure we were happy with the room and that we had no problems as did pauline ( from the front desk ) after we got settled in the resort itself is beautiful and one of the nicest we 've ever been in the top shelf drink choices were great and the bartenders make very good drinks consistently , as opposed to what we 've experienced at other resorts in the caribbean there are more bars in this resort than any other we 've stayed in i was guess there are at least a dozen , maybe more our favorite bartender was kenny who at times seemed to be everywhere we thought the wait staff at the pool and on the beach was excellent benjamin at cafe kafe was also very good our favorite drinks were de drink of de day along with maitai 's and benjamin also made a great bloody mary he also made me a wonderful ice cream drink with bailey 's kahlua and amaretto we did bring dollar bills for tipping but it did not seem to change the quality of the service and the people receiving it really appreciated it the beach is long and beautiful but not great for swimming in or for water sports the waves were huge and crashing down all the time the undertoe was also very strong most people did not swim in the ocean at this resort the beach is also very windy most of the time further back in the resort the breeze is wonderful but it was a bit too strong on the beach the island in general is very breezy which you notice immediately upon arrival at the open air airport it feels great everywhere but as i said , is a bit too much on the beach at times we had no problems with bugs or bug bites anywhere i read that these problems usually occur during the rainy season which is not at this time of year of course , we brought bug spray but found no need for it at all and we took many long walks on the beach at different times of the day the pools are beautiful although the pool water temp at times was a bit cooler than we like some days it got nice and warm by the afternoon but one or two days it was too cool to swim in and most guests , including us , just lounged around poolside the main pool winds around the property like a lazy river at times its the largest pool we 've ever been in shopping is best just off the resort property to the left if you 're facing the beach we also walked down the beach to the right about 3/4 of a mile to another shopping area but the prices there were much higher than those just next to the resort on the left the best shopping is all of the vendors where nancy 's is located i got a great deal on coffee from vendor #1 these vendors are even cheaper than those who come onto the property and set up in the evenings we did the free horseback ride if you like horses , you 'll be as upset as we were to see the condition of this group its very sad how undernourished they were the ride was nice , on the beach but i was sad for the horses we ate at most of the restaurants spice was our favorite and felt that chez isabelle was a bit over rated the food in chez isabelle was good not wonderful but the service was excellent the language barrier was not as bad as i thought it would be based on what others have written in fact i do not think it affected our stay much at all on our last day at lunch after he found out we were leaving shortly , our waiter brought us over a boxed lunch and 2 bottles of water for the ride which we thought was so thoughtful this resort was a wonderful place to visit the staff is the reason it 's so great they definitely go out of there way for you it was much more impressive than secrets capri in the mexican riviera which i also loved and thought would be hard to beat after staying there 2 years ago we still ca not understand the complaints of some guests we loved it and this was our 11th or 12th higher end all inclusive if you 're ok with not being able to swim much in the ocean and do the ocean watersports , then you 'll love it too 
loved the excellence punta cana i am writing this short review late because until a week ago i did not know this site was available the trip to the hotel was long and bumpy , but when we arrived at excellence we were greated with a cool cloth and a cold glass of champaign , wonderfull after that we were taken to our private check in with more drinks and a buffet set up while waiting we sat on the upstairs patio where we enjoyed a drink overlooking the pool then were escorted to our room ( swim up room ) loved it , we really enjoyed being able to get up and sit on our patio , go swimming and still have access to our room ( washroom ect ) staff was wonderfull beach was wonderfull you can walk for miles the food was great ( did not really like the warm water lobster and the steak was hit and miss what i liked best was that you did not have to make reservations to eat , just go there , so what if you had to wait 5 or 10 min ( which only happened in the french and mexican rest we met many nice couples there everyone was very friendly make sure you tip because they do not make a lot of money and they really appreciate it we did not go on any excersions so when we found out that you could take a 20 minute hellicopter to the airport instead of the bus we decided it was worth the extra money your luggage has to go on the bus , but that was no problem because the bus meets you when you land we were picked up in the parking lot of the hotel then taken down the coast of punta cana and the pilot pointed out the hotels and their names to us he also pointed out the new hotels that where being built then we circled around a sunken ship where they dive , lots of picture taking this was the highlight of our trip , we felt like royalty all in all we had a wonderfull trip and would go back 
fabulous resort before leaving for my honeymoon , i read tons of these reviews most of which were very helpful to avoid restating all that the other reviews have to say , i am just briefly offering two pieces of advice that i have not seen mentioned 1) the spa discounts one specific service each day , i believe 20% off the regular price however , you do not need to actually receive the treatment that day , you just need to book it the day of the special for the day you want it and pay ahead my husband and i received wednesday 's hot stone special and did not actually get the massage until saturday now that rainy season is over , the bugs are not quite as much an issue however , if you do get bit , there is a doctor on premises who can give you cream that miraculously clears up the bites i saw the doctor around midnight and by the time i woke up in the morning all of the bites had disappeared the best part is that they take major insurance from the states the entire experience did not cost me a dime 
dissappointing my husband and i were really looking forward to a nice , relaxing honeymoon and we were quite dissappointed we reserved what was supposedly the best of the best of rooms - the excellence honeymoon suite , to ensure our relaxing vacation our room was overbooked the first night that set the tone for the rest of the week we were in a sub - par room for the first night ( there was no point in unpacking and settling in ) and spent most of the second day trying to figure out when we were going to move , where to , and making sure everything went with us this would not have been that awful , except that the resort was not to interested in rectifying the situation they only wanted to offer us an $80 credit to the logo shop ( which we were not purchasing anything from ) , any extra wines ( which we did not want to buy ) , or the spa ( which we were not using ) the $80 was supposedly the difference between the two rooms they also tried to say that they gave us extras on our package , but what they were offering was already in our package a good part of the following week was spent stewing over this and arguing with the policy after almost two months of back and forth with the travel agent , the decided to refund us $100 back on my credit card after spending almost $4000 for the resort , i think a $100 refund is pathetic on top of the room issue , the food was not very good i keep reading these other reviews and wonder where they were eating that the food was so great we were not impressed at all the room service was good if you tipped them the first time around the electric was off and on randomly ( which i have heard is often a problem in the islands ) , and twice our cold water went out ( not really fun to be scalded if you 're in the shower 
been to quite a few , this one ranks we have been fortunate to quite a bit of traveling , in and around many tropical areas of the world while we have been to more luxurious locations , from an overall price/value/service/quality perspective , excellence punta cana ranks right at the top the review below by the honeymooners really sums it up well we were at the resort the last week of jan and had a very similar experience i would highly recommend this property to anyone with the following caveats :1 as stated , its adults only its no good for water sports in the ocean if you are looking for something where you can swim with the fishes in front of the resort , look elsewhere you need to get your ??pot? people begin reserving their place by the pool/on the beach at sunrise by 9am the good spots are gone the ride from the airport is around an hour and for half of it , the roads have quite a few potholes if none of the above bothers you , you can?? beat the rest for the price we highly enjoyed it and will definitely go back 
my wife and i found this to be absaloutely amazing we were supposed to be at the new edenh real resort but they overbooked and we were compensated with the excellence this was a blessing the food was all excellent we found all the restaurants to be wonderful we ate at almost all of them we found spice ( asian ) to be the least of the restaurants , but everything else was awesome yes , as some have complained , the waiting tended to be long , but there was always a restaurant with a shorter wait , and it does not hurt to grab a few drinks while you wait for your seat you have to remember that the alternative at other resorts is to get 2 or 3 nice meals all week and be stuck with the buffet for the remainder the staff were awesome we had no complaints whatsoever at the restaurants they were excellent never waited long for service i do not think that my wine or water glass were ever empty , they were constantly refilling room service staff were also great we had tea and coffee sent to our room most mornings and even had breakfast sent one morning at 0630 cleaning staff were great as well someone complained that they did not get the extras but we left a dollar on the pillow and that got us plenty of extras we had towel animals one day , flowers on our sink and counter , extra towels , extra water , coffee plenty of extras one day we did not get our room cleaned until later , but you have to understand the amount of rooms vs cleaning staff is a big difference and they do a good job when they get there not every room can be cleaned before 10am the grounds and facilities were wonderful the beach was nice , with all the chairs and beds , hammocks , etc the location is a tad disappointing due to the water it is windy and rough , as others have mentioned the waves can be very fun to play in , but you do not get the calm blue waters that we really wanted there are lifeguards there constantly now and are vigilant in making sure people do not go out too far overall there is no way to complain about our experience it was relaxing and enjoyable and i really feel people need to understand that this is not north america and there is not perfect water and power sometimes we have power outages here in ontario deal with it you do not need electricity to sit on the beach and get a tan 
better late than never review we are ready to take our next vacation and have been reading an unbeleivable number of poor reviews for the hotel that we have chosen so i decided to comment on our unbeleivable stay at excellence punta cana back in may 2007 we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary this resort is definately geared towards couples you have your choice during the day of lounging in the quiet area with water falls and soft music or you can join the entertainment staff and swim up bar and party on the entertainment staff and cooks provided an unbeleivable feast on the beach daily for lunch , highly recommended the staff looking after maintenance know how to please the human eye everything was kept immaculate the restaurants were lovely and it was refreshing not to have to make a reservation waiting for a table at your favourite restaurant was a pleasure , as you were able to sit in the outdoor area listening to the very talented saxaphone player this is the place to get away with your significant other and renew your love only thing i would stay away from is the local alcohol that they keep on the bottom shelf at the bar ( ca not remember the name ) it is deadly may miss dinner and the show that night if you decide to endulge ( i think it was called mamajuana ) fantastic place to stay , not much around though , besides the hotel 
fantastic getaway i just returned from a trip to the excellence punta cana and it was terrific the food was great , pools and rooms are beautiful , and the staff are extremely friendly and courteous the beach was incredible , there were always plenty of chairs and you did not feel crowded like at some resorts yes , the current is strong and the waves are rough but it 's a lot of fun if you like the ocean and are careful there are staff on the beach who whistle at you if you get out too far but the water is beautiful , the sun is hot and the sand is super soft and clean the staff work really hard and everywhere you look they are cleaning or making improvements to the grounds and the facilities all of the staff were friendly and gracious the entertainment staff were really great , especially rey who is a lot of fun to be around and made us feel really welcome there - especially when we were jamming out to my ipod my husband and i traveled with two other couples and everyone had a great time my only complaint ( and it 's a minor one ) is that there is no place to just grab a sandwich or a snack to go on days when you are lounging on the beach or by the pool the dining rooms open at lunch do not allow swimsuits so it was a pain to have to keep changing clothes if you happen to miss whatever was cooked on the beach that day my husband got sick one day and i tried to take him some toast and fruit from the dining room but the staff actually stopped me and said i could not take the food out even when i explained what was going on they said room service had to bring the food to our room so , about 20 minutes later a staff member showed up at our room with the same plate covered in plastic wrap the other thing i want to mention is there is no local economy in punta cana so if you are like me and like to get out of the resort and explore the area this is not the place traveling outside the resort was discouraged and as other travelers have mentioned it takes a long time to get anywhere by car there is plenty to do at the resort and i was certainly never bored but i would have liked to get out more many of the excursions are offered only on certain days and many of them take all day because of the traveling time i would also concur with the previous traveler who mentioned the snorkeling excursion we have snorkeled with sting rays before and this was a disappointment the sting rays and sharks are trapped in the enclosure where you swim they cram way too many people onto the boat and into the snorkeling areas these things are by no means the fault of the resort but it 's good stuff to know before you go the excellence punta cana is a beautiful resort in a beautiful country we would definitely go back and will recommend it to friends and family 
beyond excellence indeed flexibilitymy husband and i ( mid 50' 's ) traveled to excellence from jan 4-10 ,2008 we missed our plane out of jfk and had our agent call the hotel to see if we could add a day to the stay since we would be a day late there was no problem and we were relieved travel to hotelwhen you get off the airplane in punta cana keep walking and pay the tax fee to get in get your luggage and then exit where you will be met by whatever hotel folks you booked with usually you board a van the trip to excellence was around an hour and 45 minutes on pretty pot - holed roads some pot holes were the size of volkswagons upon arrivalsince we upgraded to the excellence club which was totally worth it we were immediately met by the hotel guy who took our luggage and escorted us to the excellence club where they offered us wine/champagne etc check in was swift and quite friendly they explained how the room works , 24/7 everything you want at your service , drinks , food , internet stations (3 in the room ) , a porch , tv , books and nice furniture we ended up going there every day for snacks and drinks after the beach and used the internet which was usually available with no hassle they will also give you towels if you ask for the beach or pool wow - be careful the room was great off a pretty courtyard with palm trees and a big jacuzzi tub everything in the bar was at your disposal and part of the price you paid do not drink any water that is not bottled they give you plenty of bottled water so drink that it is ok to drink the water in the restaurants , as apparently that is bottled as well the first morning we walked out of the room and started down the stairs ( we were on the 3rd floor ) and i slipped down the stairs on my tailbone and stopped myself with my right hand it had rained over night and everything was extremely slippery i thought my hand was broken my husband found me ice right away i ended up seeing the resort doctor when the pain was too bad to take and he immediately gave me a shot and a splint and sent us on our way in a taxi about an hour and a half away to the medical clinic for xrays we had to show our passport and insurance cards they treated us great and quickly at the clinic but the xrays were taken with no protection ( bad and we had to sign 2 blank credit card slips in case our us insurance did not pay up if it rains , as it does every day for a few minutes in the late afternoon , be careful we met a lady who almost broke her collar bone after falling on wet floors as i did example of excellenceobviously this put a damper on things but the resort was so excellent that it made up for it one night we decided to use the jacuzzi in the room and it was not filling up correctly i mentioned it to the lady at the club and she said she would take care of it for us when we returned that night it was filled with hot bubble bath and rose petals in the tub and on the bed with chocolates the people who work there are dirt poor tip them whenever you get a drink a dollar is like gold to them we left a few bucks every morning and evening on the bed pillow for the morning and evening maids we could not believe the conditions under which they must live so be generous we saw a bunch of slobs from all over the world who treated the help like [ - - ] and never pulled out a dime dont ' be ignorant - if you can afford this resort , give a bit of it up to people who work their asses off and are really poor we met one guy on the beach who was haitian and his story was beyond pathetic i tipped him $20 one day because i knew that would give him more than one meal a day for a couple of months at least i knew where my charity was going restaurants - - when you enter the restaurants , the hostess asks you to take her arm the breakfast buffet in the main dining room was great every day many good choices and always fresh fruit , their dr hot chocolate , desserts , hot foods of all kinds and drinks barcelona was great , the mexican was great , the italian was ok , the french was great the asian sucked really bad do not bother the grill was good , the lobster place was ok if you like warm water lobster ( we 're from new england so it was not our favorite ) you can even get pizza all day try the fresh fish any time , as it is great lunches can be had at several places including the beach bar and the buffet place and we liked that best for the many choices no reservations are needed anywhere except if you go to dinner between 7 and 9 you may need to wait just a bit at some places we rate the food generally a 7/10 we spent most of the time on the beach there was no problem getting huts or chairs and even the raised beds and hammocks there was plenty of room and privacy not crowded at all sand was amazing we walked to the right of the beach all the way to the next resort which was a dump compared to excellence poolvery beautiful with lots of chairs plenty of pool mats available with no problem at night they had different entertainment from karaoke to stage shows that were pretty hokey but at least there was something to do the guy who plays the sax in the lobby lounge is amazing as well if you want to drink 24/7, you can do that pretty easily as they constantly ask you what you want to drink almost to the point of being annoying ( i 'm not a drinker really but my husband is ) spa and work out roomwe did not use the spa , as it was way too expensive , but we did use the gym treadmills every day take a towel and a water bottle as complimentary when you are there do not bother buying at the stores , too expensive and nothing particularly interesting you can walk the property pretty easily for a good walk as well there are tennis courts (2) and pool tables etc at an outdoor bar as well if you are into games , they have them at the pool everyday we like peace and quiet so we avoided that stuff conclusionwe would return to this resort again in a minute 
excellence is fantastic we have just returned from excellence punta cana and had a great time from the moment we arrived , we were greeted with great service from the front desk , pauline was fantastic she took care of us from the moment we arrived , right to our last day there we stayed 2 weeks and wished we could stay another 2 weeks we have travelled all over the carribean and no other hotel gives service like this one these guys know what they are doing and that 's why this hotel is called excellence the rooms are clean , the restaurants are great , our favorite was chez isabelle and the spice , our least favorite was the lobster house you must eat at the grill for lunch , everything on the menu was great toscana was great for dinner as well , if you like risotto , then you 'll like this italian restaurant even room service was great and always arrived hot and with a smile the entertainment staff was fantastic these people work their butts off to ensure that you are having a great time you must meet rosemary and innes from the entertainment , they 're great as far as excursions , we booked them through happy harry at the activity centre where you rent the boggy boards he 'll be sure to hook you up with any tour you want at the best prices and with a smile as far as the beach goes , you are on the atlantic side which has more waves then the carribean side but let me tell you how much fun that is if you are not a good swimmer , then stay closer to the beach make sure you get a boggy board from happy harry and you 'll have a blast in the water beach service is great , you do not have to get off your chair for a drink , they come to you the best advice i can give you is to bring lots of dollar bills , these people deserve every penny of it we tipped more here then any other place we have been they will remember you when you do so and the service becomes that more spectacular we met people from all around the world who have travelled here before and continue to come back to excellence , we will be back and miss them all so much you will not be disappointed with this hotel one more thing that might be useful , we stayed in the excellence club , our room was 8007, the building was a little newer , rooms were nicer , but the club is worth the extra money we ate at the club a few times for lunch and dinner and for snacks and the food was great it is an exclusive lounge with comfy chairs and a t very quiet and a nice change to sum up our vacation , 10 out of 10 
great service excellence , punta cana had some of the greatest service in the ca rribean the excellance club well worth the extra $ great dinners , the spa was very good , nice selection of services a lot of nice upgrades all through the resort 
outstanding we just returned from excellence punta cana ( formally secrets ) our fifth visit to this resort it was nice to see alot of the staff is still working for the new management we ca not say enough about the staff - - - so friendly and attentive roberto at the club ( a real gentleman ) always asking if he could do anything for us our two favorite bartenders - donele and rafaelina ( at the swim up bar ) always smiling altagracia a little lady with a big laugh and heart carlos works in the lobby and he is so upbeat ( what a greeter ) pool is beautiful - - the beach - - is magnificant ( just swim where the life guards tell you to ) rooms - - well kept we had a beautiful view of the ocean food - - - great ( seven restaurants ) plus two days before we were going home they opened an out door pizza plaza drinks - - - what can i say ( plentiful ) entertainment has improved - - hats off to luciano and all the entertainers domingo - - a fantistic saxophone player dave richards - - late night entertainer ( so funny ) oh , we ca not forget the excellent piano player in the toscane restaurant all in all this resort has been one of our favorites we travel with another couple and we are looking forward to returning again next january ed  kathy sullivanmassachusetts 
muy bien first of all - thanks to all who have wriiten reviews this was my first time using this site and will certainly use it again it 's hard to imagine how people visitng the same resort at the same time can have such different expeiences with that said , my wife and i are 32 and this was our third all inclusive in the past two years overall , we had a great experience and would highly recommend this resort to other couples we also talked to many other guests during our stay and came across very few complaints this was a great place to relax , enjoy the sun , some cocktails , and some good food if you wanted more organized entertainment there was plenty of that as well , and if not , you just situate yourself furhter from the main pool and beach for more peace and quiet to sum up all that was good - the pool , the beach , and the grounds were all perfect the room was clean , but nothing spectacular ( just fine for a beach resort ) the staff and service were excellent as were the drinks we had no problem with mosquitos because i personlly found some of the negative reviews more helpful , i just wanted to point out some of the quirky things that we came across the food - if you 're expecting over the top gourmet meals , you might be disappointed i think it 's important that this is not new york , la or anywhere inbetween for an all inclusive resort that caters to thousands of guests everyday , i think the food was very good if you are from the ne usa , the lobster is different from what you 're used to these are caribbean lobsters which are more like a giant shrimp ( all tail , no claws ) we found the lobster to taste pretty good , but the only restaurant with small portions chez isabelle was great and the closest thing to true fine dining the mexican restaurant was very good as well some other reviews mentioned that not every restaurant was open every night i think this was the case when they had dominican night on the beach and expected many people to eat there as it was a big event and heavily staffed we ate there and it was decent we did wait 20-30 min at both the french and mexican restaurants but expected that and did not mind waiting at the bar with a pager this was a good time to talk to other guests and compare notes ' about what to do and where to eat the water - like everyone else , we were heavily warned about the rough water and we did hear about the recent drownings not that the ocean should be taken lightly , but if you live anywhere on the east coast ( usa ) , i think that you 'll find the waves to be average or below average in size there were rip currents that were visible from the beach that were about 10-15yds wide spaced 20-30yds apart however , even at high tide , the water was very shallow to about 100yds if you are not used to being around the ocean and previous trips have been to the calm caribbean , the water may not be for you there is a lifeguard who walks the entire beach by himself and does not have the proper equipment or help to rescue you more than a few feet away also , if you are going to walk the beach , face the water and walk to the right only we heard it is not safe to walk left washcloths - yes there was this kind of funny washcloth situation for some reason , each day the maids would leave us one or none washcloths ( but sometimes as many as 6 bathtowels ) if you notice , most of the bathrooms on the property are stocked full of nicely folded washcloths for people to dry there hands nice touch , but i would rather have them for my shower given the choice needless to say , on our way back to our room from the beach , we conveniently passed thrugh the lobby and made a stop at the bathroom again , overall very little to complain about if you survive the ride from the airpor t , you 've got nothing to worry about : ) i hope there was some helpful info here have a great trip 
excellent we are a married canadian couple in our late 40's who have travelled extensively through the caribbean and stay at all inclusive resorts seeking 5 stars if available we were at excellence for 2 weeks 08-22 january our third trip to the dominican the drive to the resort is as everyone claims unnerving and horrible it was very stressful especially at night after an 8 hour flight the check in was prompt and we asked for a better room and were moved the very next day to a perfect poolside room at no extra cost the rooms are very clean and comfortable maid service consistent the ocean is very rough and we found that disappointing as we are beach people it is yellow sand , not the white sand on bavaro beach we discovered , and this is important to note , that if you walk down the right of the beach only 5-10 minutes , the water is smooth and perfect for swimming or wading absolutely warm and clear and calm , the beach is safe and well travelled the food is above average for the dominican our favorites were spices and the french restaurant the lobster house is good , but limited selection and not the lobster we know in canada but very nice in a beautiful setting sitting outside lunch has 2 options - the grill a la carte or the buffet the buffet is very hot during the day with no air conditioning or fans but the selection especially the salad bar is great the grill is sit down service and very relaxing by the pool with a lovely breeze they also have a cook prepare lunch daily on the beach which is fun the service at this resort is outstanding and the staff are very friendly we did not eat breakfast often as i opt for the gym in the morning , but it is buffet the bar service is good , especially the martini bar staff are outstanding one little waitress jenny , brought my husband clamato juice she had at home for his caesars as we canadians have trouble getting clamato at these resorts - what a sweetheart they have domingo the sax player at night who is wonderful , we bought one of his cds to bring home and there is dancing a few nights the adult piano bar guy is in the martini bar , who is hilarious the shows were very good the gym is quite good , with treadmills , ellipticals , stepper , bikes and weight equipment with free weights somedays were busy and others empty the fella who runs the gym is very good , he will be your personal trainer if you ask him the spa is nice , with daily specials we found the age range at the resort covers every decade not many singles , mostly couples the day activities are geared for the younger adults we would likely return to this resort again we had a wonderful , relaxing time i will say again that the staff are excellent we did not like the long drive from the airport and that will influence our decision to return as will the roughness of the ocean at this resort location we will definitely seek excellence resorts in other destinations but overall , it was a great resort and you will enjoy yourself without a doubt 
the excellence punta cana dark days of night the excellence resort ( punta cana ) was very nice but the service was not all that i thought it should be the star rating varies from 4-6 and it is definitely a four star resort the excellence was extremely dark and scary looking at night the lights on the grounds other than the major thorough fares were all cut off at a certain time ( i eleven , midnight , etc i spoke with the night manager about the darkness of the resort at night and he basically told me he would try to move us from the back room and i never heard from him in the future they need to warn young ladies that are traveling without males that this is a dark place to be and that the focus is on couples the garden level was pitch black on the terrace at night and anyone could walk up to your door they might want to consider putting females on the second level of this resort it might also interest you to know that we experienced a very difficult time trying to get american money and maybe people should try to bring as much as they can before they get there additionally , i am also not sure if i experienced bedbugs because i have all of these little bites on my legs and ankles the positive part of the trip is that the food was good and the resort workers were very friendly and nice the concierge was excellent and since i was with my friends i managed to have a good time , however , this is not a place that i would like to visit again or recommend anyone else to visit thanks for everything and i hope this feedback is taken with the positive nature in which it was sent note : the excellence advertised 24 hour service but you were unable to get liquor or any food ( other than hotdogs and hamburgers ) late at night also , the fact that the grounds were dark at night says to me that they do not want people to enjoy the resort at night so what does that mean is it dangerous at night for some reason because i would think having people stumble around in the dark trying to get to their rooms is really foolish and dangerous 
our excellent vacation we just returned from spending 6 great nights in excellence punta cana most of the reviews i read was very good , i also read some negative reviews , but decided to go anyway well i glad we did the trip there was not as bad as most people said it took me an hour to get to jfk so an hour and ten minutes was no different , plus like the saying goes i got to see how the other half lives when we got to the hotel they were waiting for us with a glass of campaign and a cool towel we had book an excellence jr club ocean view so we were taken to our private check - in where we were told to go eat something in the up - stairs buffet then they came to get us and took us to our very nice room the room was very clean and nicely decorated , we had a nice view of the ocean and i loved the jetted tub yes the bed was a bit hard but that made me get up early so i got to enjoy everything there is to do in the resort i loved the turn - down service every night yes the beach looks rough but i saw a lot of people swimming , and if they went out to far the lifeguard was always on the look out we just walk a little ways down the beach where is was calmer and got in the water there the drinks were a little weak so what ever i ordered i just ask for a shot on the side , added it to my drink and it was just right for food was good not the rainbow room but it was good they did not have tostones ( a dominican food made from green plantains ) so we asked waiter and the next day they had it for us well this is our excellent experience at excellence punta cana it great so go stop by and say hi to benjamin in the caf? kafe bar , to ramona in the lounge , and to miguel and manuel in the grill restaurant 
excellence - not that great the hotel grounds were pretty , well kept and the beach was beautiful we stayed in a room with a swimout the room was nice , but we found the swimout not to be a plus because if you used it to go into the pool , your room was then unlocked the main problem with this resort was the food it has seven restaurants , but not all of them were open every night although , they make a point to stress that no reservations are required , there were two - hour waits even though there were empty tables we found the restaurant management to be unaccomodating the food was pretty bad , too the lobster restaurant was the worst - and , if you are looking for a healthy salad , forget it also , if you wanted to have lunch on the beach or by the pool , the only take out was pizza only two restaurants were open for lunch , but you had to have a sit - down lunch who wants to do that when you are enjoying the beach they did cook paella or other seafood combinations on the beach , and some of it was good 
an excellent vacation just returned from 11 days in paradise and ca not wait to return to the excellence punta cana my friends and i travel extensively and we go to the dr at least twice a year normally , we stay at the paradisus , but decided to try something new the excellence punta cana fit all of our requirements from the moment we arrived at the resort it was paradise i stayed in the excellence club and it was well worth the money service was good everywhere at the resort , but within the excellence club - they went that extra mile many , many thank you 's and gracias to nicki , maria , roberto and ana from the excellence club all i had to do was ask and they made it happen - from having my jacuzzi run at a specific time to making my spa appointments even decorating my room on my birthday my room was located in building 10 and offered a wonderful oceanview i was impressed that the safety deposit box was large enough to hold my laptop there is wireless service available ( but the signal is strongest in the main lobby and the excellence club lounge ) the rooms have a stocked mini bar which includes ( gin , bourbon , rum , vodka , beer , sodas , and water ) - plus snacks thank you to mario , ilbon and kelly from the mini - bar team - they kept me stocked with oreos , red bull and licor 43 i 'm a picky eater and the resort offers so many choices - i was always able to find a great meal there is a breakfast and lunch buffet available at toscana , but i never tried them room service will deliver a great breakfast and lunch at the grill or on the beach should not be missed for dinner i visited all of the restaurant 's and really enjoyed agave and spices reservations are not taken at the restaurant 's , but i found that the wait time ranged from 15 - 30 minutes they give you a disc that glows when your table is available , that way you can go to martini or cafe kafe while you are waiting service at the pool at times was hit or miss , but the pizza delivery hits the spot around 1:30 in the afternoon we never had any problem finding a desirable location by the pool there were always chairs , the fabulous beds and pool floats available loved that the resort is adults only there is a one hour transfer to the hotel by car and next time i will take the helicopter transfer i travel extensively and on average spend 80 - 100 nights a year in hotels the few concerns that i had while at the hotel , were quickly resolved they met and exceeded my expectations and look forward to returning this and the other excellence resorts 
our best all inclusive vacation ever my wife and i , along with another couple , just returned from a nine day stay at excellence this was our fifth stay at excellence and by far , the best we have stayed at other all inclusives in jamaica and elsewhere so this is not a one dimensional review no resort is one hundred percent perfect , but we feel excellence is as close to perfection as you will find the staff is no less than wonderful they are gracious , friendly , polite and fun to interact with some speak english better than others , but we never had a problem communicating with anyone the rooms were clean , comfortable , roomy and the mini bars were full of beer every day i should mention water and juice as well the food in all the restaurants was very good there is a variety of restaurants and menus you will not go hungry or thirsty the only mixup we had was one person in our party received a chicken burger instead of a cheeseburger she was going to send it back until she tasted it it was so delicious so she kept it the entertainment has improved over the past six years and the shows are enjoyable to watch the pre and post show entertainment is very good as well domingo on the sax along with his keyboard partner are great dave the jamaica man is awesome as well ( there are some mosquitos at night they do not bother me but you may want to bring some bug wipes ) some of the best entertainment comes from the service employees they are really fun to be with there are so many i ca not mention them all but , i have to mention a few : amado at the martini bar , dionel and rafelinaay and the rest of the crew at the swimup bar , altagracia on the beach , confessor in the grill restaurant , kelly who serviced our minibar and so many more our trip would not have been so wonderful without the gracious hospitality of junior rodriguez ( reservations manager ) , victor doreteo ( restaurant manager ) and of course , robert puello ( excellence club manager ) we ca not wait to return again next january eugene  marcia mattioli dave mushymassachusetts 
vacation fron hell i travel with my female relatives every january for at least a week every year ths year the resort chosen was the excellence resort in punta cana , to say i was excited about the trip was an understantment there was several reasons for my excitement , one being that the trip would be extended to two weeks as opposed to one week secondly to escape the cold as well as others now this has not been my first trip to the island , i actually consider it my second home , but this would be my first time at this resort when chosing the resort we were told it was between a 4-5 star resort and had actually knew someone that had given the place rave reviews upon driving up the grounds were well kept , the belloys greeted us with cool towels and a glass of champagne we should have left after this point looking back we were given our rooms and escorted to them , only to find roaches ( not the first i 've seen but considering this is a highly rated hotel i did not expect them ) , a dirty jacuzzi , nonworking airconditioning and bugs in the coffemaker located int the room we called the front desk and apologies were made all around and a new room assigned this time we were greeted with a toilet that flushed when it wanted and a bathroom fan that sounded as if it came from the hoover administration , electricity that was hit or miss ( the light over the vanity lasted approximately 4 days on average ) a broken elevator ( it was out for several days , thank god we are fairly young and in good health ) maid service that did not show up until late evening ( there were 3 women to clean the room{my roommate and myself actually clean up behind ourselves and there was not any dishes left in the room} ) and on my last night the maid did not come until 5pm and then she made the beds and sweep the floor left thread bare towels and no washcloths ( but that was a normal no washcloths so we started taking them off carts when we saw them ) we spoke with one other couple that was traveling from new york and her husband reportedly had a screw in one of his meals ( i personally did not have a problem with most of the food ) the activities staff was practically nonexistent or maybe they were just dead tired for they had no enthusiam about the job ( at least that 's what i 'm going to say ) the wait staff basically hovered in the background while 1 or 2 waiters took orders checkout a bellman never responded to my calls to collect my luggage so i had to bring them around myself ( thank god they fixed the elevator ) to be fair the spa services were great but that was about it 
the ultimate relaxation we have just arrived back from the excellence , and agree that we have had a wonderful vacation we enjoyed everything about it the food was great overall ( not gourmet ) but very good the pools and the surrounding garden areas were beautyful where you didnt have a seaview , you had a wonderful gardenview the beach was beautyful , although i can understand if keen sea swimmers are a little dissappionted , as the sea was quite rough personally it doesn`t bother me that much , ( dont like sharks either anyway ) just walking barefoot in sand in the morning as the sun comes up is amazing ( i just wish that the dominican republic would do something about the litter situation as soon as you walk outside the resort there is rubbish everywhere however , this seems to be a general problem in a lot of countries e spain , greece , and some parts of italy too isn`t it time we do something about this , it is an enviromental disaster there is need of maybe some maintenance - work at the hotel , both on the rooms , and the sportsfacilities , but we could see that there was loads of work going on obviously with new owners , they are determined to give the whole hotel a lift which i am sure they will succeed in doing and how charming with the small bird - sanctuary everyone seemed to stop and have a look , and coming from norway , it is not everyday you see flamigos in the free then the huge plus - point - the staff whatever this place may lack ( and you have to look hard for it ) it makes up for with amazing staff we have never met friendlier people from the gardeners to the reception we have travelled for years to southern europe ( france , italy , spain and greece ) , and friendly people are few and far beetween and we speak french , we always try a little spanish and italian when we are there , and it rarely has a great impact on the service but here , a completely different scenario we realise that americans in general are used to a high level of service , but for europeans , this was amazing and yes , we did tip , but not always , and it still didnt seem like that was the major point , they were still friendly and smiling , and could not do enough for you we felt utterly spoilt we would like to mention , germy in the gym very knowlegdable and very helpful we really hope that the exellence will make use of his talent and knowlegde in the new gym with new facilities he is a bonuspoint , an excellent personal trainer also rolando and lukas on the tennis courts with limited resources ( courts were in desperate need of work , and average ball quality ) they could not do enough for you always smiling , and coming out with towels , water , and trying to find the best balls to play with when the courts are worked on this will be a fantastic facility especially combined with the new gym , aerobic /dance facilities not just a romantic hotel , but a really good sportsplace for people interested in general fitness then the green team , jesus , julio , rey , ines , juan carlos , franklin and whoever i left out happy , service minded and so much fun the waiters , sweet dorling , altagracia with the infectious laugh ( cafe cafe ) , rolando and santa in the breakfast room to mention two , they were all fantastic we thoroghly enjoyed our stay , and not ventoring out is actually quite relaxing if we wanted an adventorous trip , we would not stay in a resort like this we wanted relaxation , sport facilities , pool and sunshine , and we had that , and fantastic service 
we booked this hotel based on the review we read everything seemed perfect the resort is quite beautiful nice hotel , beautiful rooms , great swimming pool , nice choice of bars and restaurants first impression was good , but the hotel is located on a part of the island that is very windy and not calm water we were expecting a very clear and calm ocean but we arrived and it was red flag on the beach the beach is very clean with white sand but the ocean is so agitated that we could not swim we are not scared of water and waves but we heard from a guest that a tourist had died the week before because of the strong waves very few people were going in the water after that even though the rooms seemed cleaned , the cleaning was done really fast ( as in many other hotels ) there were opened bottles of water in the fridge when we arrived this is a great resort if you do not particularly enjoy swimming in the ocean and you prefer the swimming pool there were several a la carte restaurants but the french restaurant ( chez isabelle ) was closed for renovation january is the peak season in dominican republic and they managed to close the most popular restaurant the food was very good ( especially in the spice restaurant - asian cuisine ) overall , the resort is beautifull , the food is good and the service is good too although , do not go there if you really like swimming in the ocean ( at least not in the winter ) i recommend this hotel for couples without kids who want to get some sun and warm weather and stay by the pool or go on the beach without swimming in the ocean 
best so far just came back from a week at the excellence and thought i would clear a few things up for the review that said the beach is not included in your stay , not true at all one small area of the beach is set aside for club members , the other miles are for everyone else all guests get full bar service and food service at your hut to the statement do not let your children see the xxx chanel no one under 18 can stay at this hotel so i guess they wo not with that said , i was very happy with the staff , they are hard working and friendly the room was as pictured , clean and comfortable food was good , not great , not the best i 've had but good somethings were better than others but i wo not bother to list them out just talking to other guests reminds me that people have very differant tasts i 'm from new england and thought the lobster was terrible , most people loved it i 'm sure you 'll find food you like i did not get to all 7 restaurants , i missed 2 my longest wait was 20 min and they gave me a pager the pools and grounds are excellent the beach needs some explaining great beach for relaxation , plenty of room and good service if your the type that needs to be in the water alot , book a differant hotel this hotel is on the atlantic not the caribbean ocean the water is warm but very rough people did drown the week before , and yes help is a long ways away keep that in mind no matter what you do ( horse back , atv , diving ) in punta cana i liked the hotel a lot i did not like it 's location i also think the dr and punta cana have some work to do the ride from the airport , the airport it self , trash everywere you look , the venders are way to pushy weather was ok but it did rain a few days and almost every night , windy as well the hotel right now is in a class that does not match the location most guests will not set foot out side the gates time will tell but dr could do a lot better and pull in a lot more people 
fantastic food but beach just ok for punta cana the food is absolutely fantastic at this hotel ( and i am picky ) we have been to 3 other equivalent hotels in punta cana and excellence is head and shoulders above all the other ones great hotel with all the luxury amenities you could ask for however the sand is somewhat of a dark yellow color and the waves are strong making it difficult and somewhat dangerous to swim in the ocean this was slightly disappointing when compared to the white sand and calm sea of most other hotels in punta cana this hotel - although called excellence punta cana - is not in punta cana but 10-15 miles further along the coast i still highly recommend it 
heaven we have just returned from 2 weeks in the dominican republic , excellence hotel we did not want to leave , it is fantastic rooms fabulous , service excellent , food fantastic people very friendly the only downside was the beach , red flag every day so could not swim in sea , but pools made up for this recommend to anyone 
not what it used to be we stayed for 10 days around christmas 2007 and new year 's 2008 this was our second visit our first was in 2005 when the facility was owned by secrets we like the dr due to the nice people , the reliable weather and the diversity of guests - - americans may be the largest group , but more than half the guests hail from the rest of the world , which we like the beach is beautiful and the facilities are pretty well kept up , considering the tropical nature of the climate public restrooms are almost always pristine the rooms could use a freshening - - the linens are dingy and threadbare ( has anyone at excellence ever heard of tide detergent ) and there 's not enough light in the shower room or by the sink the excellence club is not worth $50 per person per day for a miami herald and more selections in the minibar the food is prepared well , available in copious quantities and has something for everyone , although meat - eaters will likely feel more at home serving conditions maintain food safety ( my wife if the original kitchen cop the theme restaurants are a nice touch , and there are not many waits we missed the french restaurant because management was in the process of renovations and relocations during our stay the biggest gap compared to secrets ownership is that the staff has been reduced this is especially noticeable at the meal service , where getting a glass of water , a cup of coffee or a glass of wine can be an exercise in patience the staff is friendly and wants to do a good job but there are not enough of them a section with 10-15 two - tops would have two , maybe three servers who did everything - - set up tables , handled service , cleaned up and bussed their own tables they worked in teams but it often was not clear who was responsible for what when patience failed , i found that getting up and walking towards the service bar would invariably bring someone running the bar service is very good , with top shelf products available and the entertainment is also appropriate bottom line - - there are new places opening up in 2008 and 2009 which will likely get our dollars when we return to the dr this facility is still a bit better than ok , but it 's also quite expensive when it was owned by secrets , it was head and shoulders above the rest - - now the gap is substantially smaller 
wonderful , amazing , beautiful ok , first off i have to say that part of the reason we had such a wonderful , amazing trip was because of all the great advice that i got from the good citizens of tripadvisor the excellence is a beautiful resort and anyone who books their vacation here is bound to have an amazing trip ( unless you are one of those people that is only happy when you are complaining or unhappy - we met a few of these people on our trip and i was so disappointed ) i do not think i can say enough good things about the place but i am going to try to give you a very comprehensive , unbiased review we stayed from jan 2 - jan we were booked into the excellence club and had an ocean view honeymoon suite so here goes : arrival : we booked a helicopter through helidosa to take us from the airport to the resort the first thing was that when we got off the plane at the airport , it was very confusing people were running everywhere trying to take your bags from you before you even had a chance to figure out what was going on do not give up your bags until you know who you are giving them to and are sure that you are giving them to the right company we were supposed to have been greeted with a sign with our names on it so that we would know where we were going but that did not happen and it was difficult to find the helidosa guy and very confusing trying to figure out what was going on but everything worked out just fine and we got our bags on the transport to our hotel and were taken to where we were supposed to get the helicopter we ended up having to wait 40 minutes for the helicopter to come which was very disappointing because we were taking the helicopter so that we could get there faster this did not happen , our bags got to the resort way before us this is not the resorts fault this was an error on the part of helidosa when we got to the resort we were dropped off in the back and just kinda left there , with no idea how to get where we were going we just followed the path and found our way eventually but it would have been nice if someone had showed us how to get where we needed to be not too difficult when we finally made it inside , we were greeted with a glass of champagne and eventually taken to the club where we did our check in the people in the excellence club - especially maria , nicki , carlos and roberto ( these were the only ones i talked with ) were amazing and extremely helpful we checked in with them and were informed that we had been upgraded to the honeymoon suite , which i had asked for but had not actually reserved thank you roberto nicki brought us up to the club lounge and we were served with the drink of our choice and some snacks while they checked that the room was ready for us ( this took about 2 minutes ) then we were shown to our room and what a beautiful room it was huge bed , vaulted ceiling , two balconies one over looking the pool/ocean and the other overlooking the ocean with a hottub on it spent most of my time on that one as it was more enclosed and larger the hot tub was amazing ( it leaked at first but maintainence was there in a jiffy to fix it ) everything about the room was perfect no complaints , and although i read some reviews that said there was a smell and brought a plug in for that , there was no smell except that of the ocean and the tropics ok that 's enough about the room , it was amazing foodthe food was terrific , i was not able to eat at chez isabelle as the schedule was a little confusing and it was not open everynight and i was unable to have dinner at the grill but we ate everywhere else and it was all amazing i had amazing dinners everynight that i ate and have absolutely no complaints about the food the breakfast buffet at toscana was excellent - we did not get a chance to eat breakfast anywhere else lunch was incredible at both the grill and toscana i would have to say my least favorite was agave although the food was not horrible , it just was not too my liking my husbands favorite restaurant was spice and the food there was delicious , i really liked toscana but no matter what the food you get is delicious and if you do not like something you can order something else one night we went with friends to spice and ordered the whole left side of the menu and half the right if you are eating at spice ask for victor he is the greatest there you will have a wonderful dining experience drinksthe drinks were delicious and plentiful i did not think that they were too light with the alcohol and they were very quick to serve i enjoyed the different daily drinks it was a fun way to start off the day i especially enjoyed the sammy sosa barsall of the bars are serviced by terrific people who are there to show you a good time and they do it the swim up bar , cafe kafe , the martini bar , the pool bar and the lobby bar are all terrific the bartenders there will make sure you are having fun and take great care of you say a special hello to baurilo he seemed to be our bartender no matter what bar we went to the beachthe beach was beautiful and fun but the waves are strong and the rip tide is very powerful i was still able to go and play in the waves and i had a great time but i would not recommend that anyone go out much past your waste and if you are not a strong swimmer , avoid it all together , it is not worth the risk if you walk down the beach to the right around the point you will find a spot that is kinda enclosed by a coral reef , it is a nice little cove and is great for swimming , not much current at all and you can even snorkel there but be careful the ocean is a living thing and it is not something to be ignored people can get hurt if they are not careful the pools were amazing much to my disappointment , i did not get to spend anytime in the cascade pool or the waterfall , but i did check it out and it was beautiful i mostly stuck to the main pool on the ocean side of the resort this pool is incredible you can float all over the place and that is where the swim up bar is also cool that you could float underneath the diners at the grill we had a lot of fun lounge chairs at the pool were hard to come by but if you asked one of the workers they would usually help you i only had a problem finding a chair one day out of 7 and even that was no biggie because we shared with another couple and it was fine the beds were hard to find as well but not impossible , in fact , i found a couple but never ended up wanting to use them because i wanted to be in the sun beach/pool towelsok , we had beach towels in our room everday plus we brought towels from home so we never had a problem none of the people we met ever had a problem either but i did note that there were a number of towel hogs people would take 10-15 towels and go lay them all out on one of the beds and then cover themselves up with two or three and use the rest as pillows this really bothered me even though it did not effect me nobody needs 10 towels people need to be less selfish casinothey tell you right away , the casino is not owned by the resort when we met with our vip rep , jonathan , he told us do not play the keno or roulette 
everything is excellent this resort really is the best of everything the staff was so eager to please and always exremely kind and polite the room was large enough to be comfortable and kept very very clean there were a few minor broken items that really diddnt affect us , the power went out once for about 25 minutes all the dining establishments were top notch and the food was wonderful ( order the fish and shrimp , avoid the red meat , they cook it to death ) the pools were wonderful though we never ventured to the big pool we upgraded to a swim up the third day of our stay and felt like it was very worth while if you get a swim up in building 1 or 2 you basically have your own private pool the beach at this resort was kept very clean as well which was one of our major complaints about the place we stayed in 2005 this is an all around top notch expreience , do not hesitate to visit this resort 
everything everyone said it would be first let me thank all the other reviewers for commenting on this site we found it extremely helpful in picking our honeymoon destination excellence is a jewel we were treated like royalty through out our stay and excellence really surpassed our expectations if you are going for romance , this is the place it 's beautiful our stay began on nov 11 2007 and lasted through the 18th we upgraded to the club level glad we did as we did not upgrade to the honemoon package but were given room 7204- private balcony -6 person hot tub -1 hour couples massage - private dinner on the beach - champane breakfeast in bed after it was said and done , we would have upgraded to the honeymoon package rather than the club level but the club people really treated us well leave the room and when you came back it was cleaned and ready as is said all throughout the reviews - take repellent with deet especially if you are wanting to spend time on the beach at night do not buy it there , $15 for a small tube true , the resort is out in the middle of nowhere , but we were honeymooning so who cares the ride really is not that bad , you are going to paradise so make the most of the ride we thought the food was awsome with the exception of the lobster house that was actually awful french , asian , and mediteranian all great at night the french resturaunt was the only one we had to wait for at all buffets have a very nice selection all the time the drinks are very good the sammy sosa with a little 151 we spent a couple of evenings after the shows in the disco interesting place that really relys on the employees to get folks up and going the pajama party was a good time the beach is beautiful although the ocean will kick your butt so be careful we had no issue with getting a spot on the beach or at the pool the little canopies are a nice break from a scorching heat have fun , and remember , you 're in a third world country and you are going to make the experiance whatever you want it to be ours was unforgettable and we ca not wait to go back 
not excellence my family went from dec 31- jan 4 we chose the option to be executive excellence club members it is not worth it i saw no difference in treatment for us compared to the other visitors there were pros and cons i will be very blunt in my review i 'll try to break this down as simply as possible service : * when you walk into the resort you will be greeted with a phrase hola welcome home , which i found cute service people smile a lot and are nice everyone seems like they want to accommodate your needs however , most of the time they will say ok and then disappear it will take quite some time to get what you 've asked for i was disappointed with their service seems like they need better management rooms : * the rooms are exactly as pictured on their site every room is the same turn down service once a day , twice if you 're lucky they give you shampoo , conditioner toothbrush , q - tip , soap , shower cap , comb , sewing kit , iron board , iron , hair dryer , slippers , bath robes , wooden hangers , a small safe , etc the rooms are old fashioned , 'charming ' would be the word you get tbs , tnt and such if you 're bringing kids , beware there is a xxx channel on the tv our bed was not too sanitary there were old ( unwashable ) stains on the sheets , they should throw those away instead of reusing them we found a lizard , fleas , beetles , and ants in our room the room does has a funky smell to it bring air freshener if you can room service is good , actually faster than eating at their restaurants meals : * similar to other reviewers , for new years dinner we waited 3 5 hours for dinner our dinner was quicker than the others because we were too exhausted to stay for dessert they ruined our new year 's eve mood , and from what i saw at the other tables a lot of people 's new years eve mood was dampened that night every night was a challenge for dinner their no reservations needed policy makes it harder for you to eat dinner because there is no reservation , people wait in a line to eat so you do not know how long it will take for you to be seated once you are seated , your orders will taken about 20-30 minutes after you 've been seated service at restaurants are tremendously slow even the buffet lunch , there were so many empty tables but it took us 15 minutes to get seated * excellence claims they have 7 restaurants but what they failed to mention was that not all 7 open everyday the french restaurant chez isabelle never opened while we were there and some of other restaurants take turns using one room on different nights if you 're going to eat at the restaurants that are outside : the lobster house or the grill make sure you 've sprayed yourself with mosquito repellent my family was eaten alive from eating at the lobster house definitely bring itch cream , mosquito bites at night are inevitable there * best meal and service was the dinner at the beach it is extra $ but was worth the experience it was the highlight of our stay there again , spray mosquito repellent overall , food was not great but edible you can see that the chefs are trying but everything was way too salty * free drinks 24/7 is the best part of the resort it 's free you 'll never drink so much fruity drinks in your life i do not drink alcohol , but still had bountiful virgin - versions to enjoy pool* the best pool i 've seen in a long time it 's clean , not too crowded because it 's so long they have huts , tents , pool bar , chairs , and an on - site waiter to bring your drinks the view from the pool is beautiful you can see the ocean not too far from the pool pool is a plus here beach* did you know that the beach is not included the sign on the beach says you have to be an excellence club member to go to the beach but do not fret nobody really checked to see if the beach go - ers were members or not beach is beautiful like a postcard do take at least 2 days to stay at the beach it 's very stunning and relaxing activities at hotel* they have program schedules everyday but most of them are not successful we waited for beach volleyball but since there were not enough people , it never happened tennis courts are loose gravel , you have to sign in and save a time frame if you want to play the site says you are given free half - hour horseback riding and such but trust me , they wo not call you up and make sure you do it it seemed like they 'd rather you forget about it because not enough horses 
fabulous holiday - however an incident occured please read this was our second stay at this hotel as we loved it so much the first time on our honeymoon in 2005 since then it has changed hands ( used to be secrets excellence ) the room was beautiful , cleaned everyday with lovely big , soft bathrobes and slipper supplied turndown service came two/three times a day we asked for a first floor room as being on the ground floor meant people walking by your room at all times of the day and also the risk of little bugs and lizards getting in your room room service was better than expected - came within 20 minutes of ordering and the food was lovely the service was great overall and staff were helpful at all times entertainment was brilliant however it the same every week ( we went for 2 weeks - 19/12/07-02/01/08 - and so ended up watching the same shows twice ) bar staff were all amazingly attentive , with special thanks to benjamin , jose and pablo entertainment staff were always around trying to encourage you to play games and make your stay extra fun ( only if you want to though ) ines , julio , luciano , franklin were all lovely people and great fun the restaurants were all great , the grill , lobster house , toscana and spice were all our favourites all had excellent menus and quality dishes barcelona and agave were okay the food was brilliant however service was a lot slower there we went on two excursions : catalina island ( $90 per person ) - with franklin and happy harry from the diving shack on the beach the trip was so much fun we would have gone again if we could have stayed another week they took us snorkelling in the sea , then to catalina island which is situated on the caribbean sea , this was absolute paradise , great food , company and a nice little trip on a double decker boat listening to meringue and bachata music and watching the staff dance their socks off we also went on a private fishing trip ( booked through a couple of chaps ( twins ) on the next beach , a short walk from excellence ( its actually just before sirenis ' beach ) it was a minimum of three people at $85 per person however we just paid for three and went on our own ( my husband and i ) three chaps skippered it for us it was equipped with 4 rods , 2 x 225 hp outboard motors and loads of soft drinks and water to keep you going for the days fishing it was a fantastic day , much better than anything we have ever done before - highly recommended the spa was absolutely worth going to i had 3 massages , a facial and a spa manicure/pedicure treatment all were fantastic , especially the 'excellence massage by matilda which incorporated around 5 different techniques into one massage we used the actual spa ( jacuzzi , sauna , steam room , ice pools etc ) quite a few times as it?? great to be able to cleanse your skin after slapping on copious amounts of sun cream and oil throughout the day the pool was lovely - not really our thing as we prefer the beach the beach was excellent we went specifically for this as we have been to resorts before where we could not even swim in the water as there was too much seaweed this beach however was extremely clean the water was crystal clear and as warm as bath water the waves were great fun , big fluffy waves to jump and dive under but dont be fooled by this whilst we were there ( on friday 28th ) , two guests got into trouble one afternoon whilst swimming the two men were spotted quite distressed and so another man went into the sea to try to save them however dissappeared and could not be found whilst we were there another guest went in to try and help however also got into trouble and almost drowned one of the staff ( actually franklin from the dive shack ) went in with a body board and managed to get the rest of them out of the water however one man drowned and could not be resuscitated helicopters from all around the country were brought in to look for the missing man over the next few days however he still was not found whilst we were there the situation is that there are clear signs on the beach stating that you swim at your own risk , there are no lifeguards and also there are red flags ( danger ) up at all times this however does not justify that there is not lifesaving drill if there is an emergency on the beach or in the water there was no boat or even jet ski available there was no first aid or life saving equipment to hand , only a security guard with a walkie talkie although these warnings were in place , there really should be more done to prevent this happening again ( this is not the first time it has happened either people get into serious trouble every year on this beach ) a seadoo jet ski costs $10,000 not much for the price of a life in the uk every beach that has people swimming/surfing on it has one of these every couple that stays at excellence spends on average at least $5,000 a week ? it does not take long to get together the $10,000 needed to buy this jet ski another thing is the drill training nobody knew what to do once 1 person is fully trained , this person can train others leading to at least a few people knowing what to do in the event that something goes wrong this is not rocket science at this hotel the executive chef ??erthold? is german ( i not dominican ) they have employed him on the basis that he trains and coaches all his restaurant staff from 7 restaurants in order to deliver a superb service i have had enough of people saying that the poor emergency procedure was due to the fact that this is a 3rd world country and they just don?? have the knowledge? if this hotel can fly in and employ a foreigner to train their restaurant staff then they can also ??ly in and employ someone to train their life saving staff? sadly our deepest sympathy goes out to the family and friends of the man who drowned and also the man that is missing we hope he is found soon 
good not great we just got back from a trip to excellence over the new year 's week while the place is nice , it was not quite up to billing in my opinion rooms ( we stayed in building 10 which is part of the club ) : the rooms are nice , rather large with a jacuzzi tub in each one however , the fridge did not get cold at all the exhaust fan in the bathroom screeched a high pitched wail when we turned it on maid service was very spotty i had to call the concierge at the club to get them to come one day as it was after 5:30 and no service had occurred we also had to request new washcloths as they had taken them from the room without replacing them food : the food ranged from good ( not great ) to awful ( the lobster room ) unfortunately the french restaurant that everyone raves about was not open any night we were there (6 nights ) the service in the restaurants was slow at best the food in the club was hit or miss we did enjoy the grill on the beach , in fact they may have been my favorite meals property overall was very clean and well kept ( other than the bathrooms in general areas ) the pools are nice and they keep the beach very clean as well as reported many times here the towels are scarce get out early to have a chance to get any people generally have their space reserved by 8:00 the staff is all very friendly and outgoing i believe that they only teach them a few phrases in english excellente my pleasure salute are the ones you hear the most the problem there is they do not always understand what you want and tell you my pleasure and then do nothing overall i believe that they would like to provide excellent service , they just do not know what it is we had no issues with mosquitoes so that was a plus the shows overall were not good they did have an unintentional comedy factor which was the only saving grace the casino is very small and the tables are just plain old and junky if you would like to do excursions or book time at the spa do so early as the time slots fill up quickly overall , we had a good time at a nice resort it just could be so much better without some of the quirky things 
fantastic but possibly deadly we vacationed at the excellence punta cana in late november/08 we were family and friends a total of 10 the place was as the name implies : excellence food , entertainment , service , casino all were great however , on the last day of our vacation , members of my family and a young man from england were called upon to save a young russian woman who had been pulled out by a riptide and was clearly drowning we received absolutely no help from any of the staff ( no lifeguard on the beach ) and in fact , the young woman was threatened with having to pay for the doctor 's visit who wandered down to the beach at least 15 minutes after the event only to agree that she was indeed alive the englishman was offered a free massage after losing his wedding ring ( they were on their honeymoon ) while saving this girl this was to leave a bad taste in our mouth after what was , until then , a fantastictrip our numerous complaints finally led to the hotel saying they would post a lifeguard on the beach and provide at least some rudimentary life - saving devices imagine my surprise to see on ctv news that a young canadian businessman is missing and presumed dead after trying to save another hotel guest from drowning again , no lifeguard , boats or anything you certainly will not be disappointed with the hotel , but more than ten feet from the shore , you 're taking your life in your own hands 
poor service , beautiful hotel and beach we spent three nights at this hotel including the new year eve the service in this hotel is not up to par with many of the caribbean resorts we have been to in the past the service in most of the restaurants is very slow and the food is not all that good the dinner at the new year eve was basically a four hour waiting game for a five course meal one of the mexican restaurant called agave is very good and was worth the wait we also opted for the executive excellence club that is suppose to provide better service we were very disappointed by the quality and the level of service provided by the excellence club i strongly recommend to not chose the excellence club option the hotel is in a secluded location and the beaches are very clean and scenic the people working in the hotel bars were very nice the resort was beautiful but it has a long way to go with regards to service 
excellence in paradise this was a beautiful resort very accomadating and excellent service was provided considering we experienced a sub tropical storm during our stay the beach was beautiful and a very clean atmosphere overall the shows at night were very entertaining and the disco bar was a lot of fun the food , especially the french restaurant was amazing , by far the best restaurant at the resort the drinks were tasty and the best part is that you were served while on the beach without even having to get up the sports bar was a lot of fun , the bar tender there was our favorite the trip was very well priced especially with all that was provided we highly recommed this resort as the ultimate vacation package the atmosphere , food and entertainment are well worth the reasonable price we will defientely go back this was the best trip we have been on 
overall good , but if you want to go in the ocean go to another resort let me start by saying that the staff is wonderful , the drinks great , and the food adequate we had a good time and especially enjoyed the no kids , as we were on break from our own the earlier reviews were right about the trip from the airport being long and bumpy - we took a private taxi as some had suggested and it was much better and quicker the major problem that i have were the two drownings that occurred during our stay the beach has huge gorgeous waves it was rough the entire time we were at the resort , and locals said that this is actually the roughest beach on the island and the main reason that the resort does not allow kids while it is impossible to prevent rip tides from forming and taking lives in even fairly calm water , i feel that there should be basic safety equipment and/or a plan in case an accident should occur a sign saying swim at your own risk ( and no lifeguards ) does not cut it they should have rescue buoys and a jet ski for rescue purposes they should also have a direct line on the beach in case of emergencies ( a security guard on the beach had only a walkie talkie with spent batteries ) it took an hour for emergency response , and it was resort guests that saved one swimmer and pulled out the ( sadly ) drowned other swimmer the third swimmer had yet to be found when i left they also do not have an aed ( they had a rusty antiquated and once again uncharged defibrillator that could not be used ) which is not much of an expense , considering i sure hope that they learn from their mistakes who knows how things may have turned out differently if the resort was better prepared on a lighter note , i would have to say that i would have preferred a second story room over a swim up room not really swim up and you ca not see the beach plus no access to your back door from the outside neutral on the excellence club we did use the computers and have snacks there every day , but the staff was not very helpful ( asked for basic help on several occasions and ended up having to go to the front desk concierge ) 
ok , but not great we were told that excellence punta cana is the best of the excellence line of resorts our vacation was okay , but with some problems considering the amount of money spent i expected a much better experience i would not mind it , if it was $2k cheaper for example i will describe pros and cons and let you decide whether it 's worth the money the beach is wonderful palm trees , plenty of umbrellas the water was warm and clean , however the surf was always rough and red flags were up the entire week sand was clean , no sharp shells , no seaweed this is a huge plus it 's huge and runs most of the resort length the grounds are awesome clean , large plenty of space to walk around the weather was great constant 83f , only a couple of short showers constant breeze at the beach reduces humidity there was much less breeze at the pool and it felt hotter buffet breakfasts and lunches were good this is adults only resort and it truly was no screaming , crying kids rooms are not up to par first room had stains on the worn out furniture window drapes were torn we asked and were granted another room it was cleaner , but furniture still needed updating badly only one sink there are lots of small broken or worn out things - bathroom mirror , knobs , malfunctioning toilet , poor tv reception , ironing board with holes and burned - through fabric - all added to a very mediocre feeling we tipped left and right , but service was very mediocre and slow waiters confused orders constantly their english was poor ( i will get to this point later ) nobody was rude , but they just do not know what great service is room cleaning was inconsistent from day to day room towels were too thin to absorb water beach towels were only available early in the morning they were gone by noon and never replaced there was definitely a lack of them , despite resort beeing half - full at best buffet breakfasts and lunches were actually great the dinners were very average presentation was good , but taste very unrefined and often either over - salted or bland even their own latin american specialties , like fajitas were not even close to what you get in the us chain restaurant they were clean , but constant lack of towels to dry hands and only one broken soap dispenser for 5 sinks i did not know soap dispensers were so expensive as not to afford one for each sink the resort lets vendors set up tables on premises to sell goodies vendors are way too pushy and the goods they sell are cheap crap for people with poor taste we felt constantly harassed by them and tried to avoid the central area where they stood we did not pay big bucks to be harassed by vendors on our vacation i would not mind them if they stood there and not grab your arm every time you walk by the resort caters to the world wide crowd - germans , english , belgians , spaniards , americans their knowledge of english should be better in the restaurant they could not understand a question whether a steak would be pink or bloody inside they confused orders but the worst thing was when we asked the concierge at the excellence club to put ice packs in the freezer , since we needed to transport some medications we explained several times that they need to be frozen he nodded and confirmed that he understood when the next day we retrieved them , the ice packs were soft and barely cool - they put them in the refrigerator when i confronted them all i got was yes , sir - freezer freezer - yes , sir he would repeat those words like a parrot he obviously did not know what a freezer is we got two massage treatments the service does not make you feel special the rooms are poorly decorated the massage tables are not modern the soothing music stops sometimes overall okay , but not great experience that you expect at this price ability to handle emergencies a very sad thing happened while we were there two men drowned they got sucked in by the waves - you cannot go deeper than chest - high in water there is no life guard on duty ( it 's stated clearly on the signs ) there was no boat to save them one staff person tried to get to the drowning people on the boogie board by the time he got there they both drowned one got pulled out they had no motorized transport to bring him to the doctor they had to carry him on stretchers all the way to the office needless to say they could not save him 
this place is the bomb i 'll start by saying that this resort is beautiful upon checking in , the initial walk to our room was breathtaking everything was truly excellent room , service , food , activities , beach , pool we booked this hotel purely based on all the positive reviews and with very high expectations , we were not disappointed in fact , our expectations were exceeded long story short you will not regret booking at this resort if you are a tennis fan , we highly recommend taking up a few lessons with the on - site tennis pro , rolando he is excellent 
just some negatives but overall fabulous first some tips , be careful re : your shoes tiles get very slippery in the rain i did see a man who fell on the tiles and was in a wheelchair with a cast on his leg bug spray is needed whenever it rains as the bugs come out afterwards and are voracious i sprayed only before dinner always and i still got some bites lying on the beach later afternoon and ended up with about 9 for the week in spite of this it was a wonderful vacation friendly helpful staff , great food ( for the most part ) you will not be hungry here , drinks were strong and great , ( husband sick and vomiting the 1st night but he drank much too much alcohol the food was fine i ate everything and never felt sick ) the grounds and pools are beautiful i wish they would have put soap in the bathrooms by the beach and pools as i think this is important the ride to the hotel was comfortable ( we used the prieto transfers do not worry if you miss the talk the next morn you can get your reservation the day before you leave ) the staff is so friendly and fun unfortunately smoking was allowed at the shows which bothered me and there are many smokers in spite of my complaints i had a wonderful time loved the animals walking about and would recommend the resort to anyone 
excellence was excellent stayed for two weeks beginning november 15, 2007 do not buy the upgrade , unless you but it there where you can negotiate overall top shelf resort , food , drinks , cigars were all great people were very friendly and helpfull if you go say hi to rey , ines , jesus , franklin , andres , julien adn rosmery if you like to take excursions it may be a little to far to travel but we just stayed at the resort and had a great time go on a resort pub crawl , you are sure to have fun 
excellence in paradise we have just returned from this wonderful hotel we stayed from the 10th to the 17th and having stayed in 5* in various countries found this to be the best  arrival : previous to our arrival i had emailed the hotel to request a room when we arrived via vip services which was very good , we were greeted with hot towels and whilst checking in a glass of champagne ( very nice ) we arrived in the evening the appearance of the hotel with all xmas decs was very effective the gentleman at reception said he had received my email and hoped our room would be suitable when we arrived at the room 2009 my partner was taken aback i had researched and had an idea but oh my god it was perfect , ground floor view of the wedding pavilion and the beach about 50yds away room : as mentioned previously beautiful room four poster bed jacuzzi , shower , complimentary toiletries , tv with cable tv ( h discovered channel 21 room was cleaned every day with wonderful towel decorations and they also called around 7 to turn bed with chocs an leaflet for next day activities minibar stocked everyday with soft drinks water and beer as it was my parters 50th ( reason for holiday ) i asked the concierge to decorate the room on that day with balloons i had brought when we arrived back at the room they had decorated room with posters and ballons and a birthday cake h was overwhelmed and a few tears were shed restaurantsservice in all restaurants were excellente spice this was the best , h very fussy about thai food and he said the flavours were spot on the grill - we had steak here and they were very goodchez isabelle - we were a bit tired that night and could not do the food justice but presentation and service good the lobster house - although i was looking forward to this the most i was disapointed , i asked for my lobster plain and maybe i should have had a sauce but it did not spoil the night toscana - we had lunch here a couple of times and one evening h said the mushroom risotto was perfect did not try barcelona and algrve room service : this was perfect , we did not go to breakfast just orderd room service every morning , very prompt said 35mins but always 15mins served very professionally brought mimosas for h birthday and on last day h arranged for bottle of champagne staff : lovely friendly warm people they made the holiday at the pool waiters always ensured that your glass was full , felt very pampered , at lunch fresh hot pizzas were brought round h made firends at the blue bar ( dianol ) and the waiter at the pool was felix although everyone else was excillente these two gents stood out activities : horse riding i ook advange of the free ride which was fine but a bit slow but then i booked the lagoon tour and that was fantastic to gallop through the surf was a wonderful memory the activity staff were very friendly i did join in a few times but just wanted to chill but they worked very hard and there was always something going on friends : we met some lovely people nick  marian , mark and his new bride , peggy  donald to name but a few casino : we went there a couple of nights and yes we did win not huge amounts but did not put in a lot eitther spa i had a pedicure and was made to feel very relaxedall in all we would recomend ths hotel to anyone ( i have promised my daughter i will pay for her to go on her honeymoon she just has to meet someone first ) and we will definitely return 
for beach lovers after reading many reviews on trip advisor we decided to spend our holiday at the excellence resort - punta cana we arrived dec 22st and departed dec to make it easier to read the review we are going to categorize the sevices transportation/arrival : do not take the limo ( $175) , a regular cab will be much cheaper and the fastest way to the resort one couple we met took a bus and they said it was fine but we prefer a cab ( $60) it was approximately 60 minutes depending on the cab plus the roads are filled with holes for 1/2 the trip check in was a breeze at the excellence club ( this was one of the very few amenities this club gives you ) accomodations : all of the rooms are the same so you are paying for different views we had a junior suite ocean view the rooms are spacious but a little outdated the beds were like sleeping on a ironing board pillows were like marshmallows bathrooms were well appointed with a lot of towels and all the toiletries that are needed for an extended stay balconies are very small and the sliding glass door did not have an exterior handle to get back in you also had to have the patio door shut for the a/c to run we would suggest the swim up rooms if you want a big patio area the higher the room number the better service : they have an abundant staff that is waiting on every need but a communication barrier is very apparent if you do not speak spanish they have a hard time deliverying on specific questions tipping is not expected unless you receive excellent service we saw some people tipping and others not tipping they try really hard and the presentation is pretty good but the food is below par at best we rated this part as an overall disappointment we did run into a few good dishes at the restaurants ( agave and toscana ) but they were rare sometimes the bartenders would be absent for extended periods of time casino : very , very small but they do an adequate job 2 blackjack , 2 carribbean stud , 1 roulette and 1 crap table 40 slots that do not take bills beach/pool : excellent this is what sets this resort apart from all the others beach/pool service was outstanding plenty of towels , tiki huts , and chairs sand was fine with no rocks or shells which made playing on the beach and water enjoyable we did no off - site activities but we are not sure you would want to risk them this is a do not leave the resort type of vacation unless escorted shopping is weak but if you like something go to the shops next door down the beach you will purchase the item at 1/2 the price and you are able to barter the price down overall : if you are a beach lover that wants to relax with no kids around this is the resort for you if you like activity , excursions , good food this is probably not the place for you it claims to be a 5- star resort but we think it is a middle of the road resort in the 3- star range 
great place , beautiful facilities , fantastic staff my wife and i stayed at this resort , december 13th -19th and overall had a very good experience as everyone 's tastes vary , i thought i would comment on the various features and resort amenties room : stayed second floor of building 3 with ocean view and the room was quite nice with four poster king - sized bed and jacuzzi tub in the room between the bed and vanity marble floors were nice touch and the room was kept clean with prompt maid and turn down service restaurants : all were decent , which as at best all that can be said for any all - inclusive at which i have stayed i thought the local cuisine served at the restaurants was superior to their attempt at recreating other countries ' cuisine portions are on the small side for american expectations , but quite frankly smaller portions are not going to hurt most of us breakfast buffet had alot to choose from , and the omellette station was quite popular the lobster house is only recommended if you have a strong hankering to eat lobster the agave/barcelona were good , but not great lastly , lunch on beach was great each day , with a large grill set up at noon highly recommend this for lunch each day drinks : top quality spirits are served ( eg stoli , quervo , johnny walker , jack daniels ) and are plentiful with service quick and friendly from the staff both altogracias and julissa were truly excellent although all were great try the mamajuana , pretty good drink , though its aphrodesiac qualities cannot be suggested as greater than the sum of the alcohil it contains has a nice , somewhat sweet flavor , with lingering flavor of cinnamon beach : very nice for atlantic side sand was soft and well groomed each day chaise lounges and beds were plentiful and well served by wait staff the beach has many aplm trees offering you the option of sun and shade the surf was strong , which made body surfing and boogie boarding a blast undertow was existent but not concerning kayaks and catamaran are available activities and staff : each day brought slew of activities with a staff that in friendly manner encouraged visitor particpation they were great stand - outs from the staff include julio , andres ( prep de votre frere blanc [yeah , pidgin french is horrible , excusez - moi] ) , inez , muriel and rosemarie ( this list is not exhaustive as all were fun and friendly , but these fine ladies and gentlemen truly made our vacation fun each day ) beach volleyball was great , as were the dance lessons where inez and muriel excelled shows each night at 10 were alot of fun though not of a calibre one might expect in vegas ( not close ) the performers more than made up for lack of polish in the infectious fun they injected in their performances the audiences truly seemed to enjoy each of them the after sho nightclub should not be missed the aforementioned staff are there to get people dancing and the dj offers a nice mix of salsa and more familiar club music in my experience , the all - inclusive experience can be made or broken by the quality of the staff , and the managers of excellence have certainly put together a staff on par with the best the caribbean has to offer they are to be commended some all - inclusives frown on tipping i can say failure to tip will not negatively alter the service you recieve if you choose not to , but knowing how hard these people work (12-14 hrs a day from my observation of some ) , it should be done typically left tip for maid staff ( leave on bed as they do not touch money left elsewhere ) and tip the bartenders and entertainment staff they deserve it also left tips for wait staff at meals , comensurate with what might be done at us buffet ( couple bucks per person ) pools : very nice there is a large pool which meanders about property , served by two bars and a swim up bar that is unfortunately placed between to buildings creating too much shade a second , smaller pool is actually two pools , one above the other with the top being an infinity pool which cascades water into the larger , lower pool this is more sedate area with its own bar all pools are well equipped with towels , lounges and beds , though somewhat greedy guests will sometimes dropa book or mag to mark one or two as their own , only to return hours later and complain when you have appropriated their claim too bad for them language : knowing spanish will help , but many staff focused on guests speak more than passable english , particualrly if you think about keeping your language in plain english without obscure words or complicated phrasing s it , hope it helps , and we would definitely return to this fine resort

perfection at excellence everything about this resort was done to perfection the grounds , the service , the food and the value are well above standard i highly suggest the excellence club for all the addedconvience and service also while you are there make sure to book a photgraphy session to record the trip , the photographer fran is fantastic , wonderful to work with and takes amazing pictures 
fantastic time , would go back , but slightly dissapointed stayed at the excellence 3rd - 17th december 2007 we had a basic garden view room the journey to the hotel was better than expected after reading some reviews on tripadvisor yes the road is bumpy and the drivers mad but it was good to look out the window and see the country check - in was disappointing - it is a long flight from the uk and we were not met with towels and a drink also we had booked the anniversary package and we didnt get all the bits and bobs at check - in and arrival in the room our room was more than acceptable and we had the basic room there was plenty of room and had hairdryer , iron , coffee maker ect the problem with the room was every time we went out we could not get back in the battery had gone on the electronic keypad we had to wait approx 20 mins everytime we wanted to get back into our room this was a problem that could and should of easily been rectified i had to loose my temper 3 days later before they sorted out the problem we were then told as an apology we would both receive a 25 min massage a lovely jesture but it came with a disclamer they wanted us to sign stating that we would not report this problem to anyone when returning to the uk if the massage had been a true apology i would probably forgot about the problem with the door but it was a bribe not an apology it may sound that we a moaning about nothing but if we went to breakfast we had to take everything like sun lotion ect with us or wait for someone to come and let us in the room and after a lovely meal and good evening entertainment we would have to go to reception and wait agian to be let in after 3 days we found the front desk very rude and were told everything cant be perfecthowever we would go back to this resort tomorrow we had a fantastic holiday and apart from the staff ar reception , the staff at this resort were fantastic and they could not do enough for you and always smiled we found the food very good , especially chez isabelle , luckily we ate there twice the first week as it was shut the second week as they are refurbishing the restaurants and moving some of the locations of the other restaurants we also found the bar service very good service was quick and always with a smile and the range of drinks was also excellent we did not go to the casino but the reps from vip warned us that there had been many complaints about the casino we used the spa and found this good and again the staff fantastic all in all we did have fantastic time and would go back if they sort out the front desk it would be perfect 
hold the cilantro please very good but not excellent the place is clean , yet getting a bit dated food was plentiful but was overly seasoned with cilantro - in everything - a beautiful suckling pig at lunch one day was ruined by the overpowering soapy taste of the weed drinks are not watered down and distributed generously loved the beach in the morning when it was sparsely populated great , wonderful warm seabreeze blowing in the face to start the day walk the grounds with your coffeee and marvel at the peacocks , turtles and other creatures lovely place to relax and enjoy an abundance of treats at your own pace i 'd go again but probably not until i 've been to few other places 
great vacation at secrets excellence punta cana my wife and i stayed at secrets excellence punta cana from october 10-15 2006 it was great we were upgraded to a poolside suite , and we were greeted with mimosas upon our arrival this resort is about an hour away from the airport , but well worth it they have beautiful wildlife ( turtles , parrots , ducks , flamingos , etc ) that roam the grounds theres also a spa where my wife and i did a couples massage we stayed by the pool since the sea was too rough we took the complimentary horse ride , and that was pretty cool i 've never been on a horse before the michael jackson show was definitely worth it , but you have to get there early to get a good seat the waitresses take your orders for drinks during the show , which is great so you do not have to get up or lose your seat there 's also a casino , it 's small , but it 's fun also the disco is the same : small , but fun we will definitely be going back 
very nice resortt we stayed at the excellence punta cana resort from sat , dec 8th to sat , dec 14th the flight was long but smooth the transportation to the resort took approx 1 hr and 15 minutes it countryside reminds a lot me of jamaica it seems the main transportation there are motorbikes and scooters we got to the resorts around 2 pm and got our room right away the main entrance is open and large lots of stone and marble reminded me of the resorts in cancun the front desk asked if we were interested in the excellence club but from i??e gleaned from several review sites that it wasn?? worth it so we declined room - the room was very nice we had a garden room view we liked the jacuzzi tub it was comparable to a room at one of the newer sandal resorts not a big deal at all i never felt once that it was required i did see people tip at dinner but very few i tipped whenever someone went out of their way for me our room wasn?? cleaned the first day until very late but once i left the first tip it seemed our room was cleaned very early dinners were great loved every restaurant we liked the asian restaurant ( spices ) the best but the mexican restaurant ( agave ) was great too the breakfast and lunch choices are pretty average in my opinion and outside the hotdogs offered at the disco there was no late night place to go to they did have 24 room service but its not the same when comparing the food to sandals i thought it was a tie overall the language barrier wasn?? bad but at times was frustrating when ordering your meals the wait staff didn?? understand english at all so ordering food or asking for anything else took some effort the playmakers were a lot of fun they seemed to care if people having a good time weren?? too pushy i was very impressed with the activities i wasn?? really impressed by the scuba diving it was a typical caribbean type dive the dive company at the resort is new and is trying to get its act together it was windy most of the time but you only really felt it on the beach it rained for an hour or two each day ? we lost one day on tuesday due to tropical storm oliver that past by the beach was very nice and the sand is really soft and they groom it every day the boogie boarding was a lot of fun but you needed to be a good swimmer in those larger waves ( slight undertow ) a couple of times they had vendors hawking their stuff at the resort near the pool area they were almost rude at times trying to get you to see their stuff not good at all the layout of the resort was nice ? not too big i thought the location of the pool bar was strange it was located away from the main area and around the corner the pool water was coolish but it only took a few seconds to get used to it i really enjoyed the trip but i wouldn?? return back to this particular location i might be willing to try one of there cancun locations in the future i would recommend this resort but go during a warmer ( less rainy/windy ) time 
homesick for excellence we went to excellence punta cana from november 17th through the 23rd almost everything about the trip was great , and i 'll give a summary of our stay we reserved a private van to and from the resort the ride was longer than we expected (1 hour 15 minutes ) but there were a lot of interesting things to see from the ride these included a man on a bicycle transporting at least 50 pounds of food with him , and smiling the whole time , crazy driving techniques of the locals , several small towns , and a lot of pretty farmland we were welcomed warmly with a greeting and a wet hand cleaning cloth upon arriving , and someone quickly got our bags ready to be taken to our room our room was beautiful and very clean it was also located on a quiet end of the resort , away from the main pool , which we liked housekeeping and wet bar restocking came daily housekeeping often came in the middle to end of the afternoon , but if we were napping they did not disturb us the only problem with our room was that our front door key never worked , and was never fixed after asking several times by our third day we basically began the honor system , and used our safe on the third day there was a bad leak from the ceiling over our sink , but someone came and fixed it by the end of the day , without any more problems beach and pools were beautiful , and we especially liked the cascade pool b/c it was tucked away between hotel room buildings and very quiet the people in the main pool tended to get a bit noisier , probably b/c of all of the bars in the vicinity i loved the beach beds , but got annoyed when people would claim one of the six beds with their belongings , and leave them there for hours - do not do it , it 's very rude take at least one night to relax on the beach beds after it 's dark - the waves , breeze , and moonlight is amazing we walked along the beach off of the resort in both directions , and got some beautiful views of the ocean , as well as discovering some interesting buildings beware of the guys just off the end of the resort trying to sell you things - they wo not leave you alone and can get rude if you do not want to buy anything i got to the point of yelling at the guy one day b/c he was trying to convince my boyfriend for five whole minutes i would recommend the main resort store - the woman was very helpful and did not prowl around us trying to sell things i enjoyed the food the most at 'the grill ' , chez isabelle , and the breakfast buffet at toscana my boyfriend liked spice and barcelona the best both of us were disappointed with the lobster house also , expect that some foods you order to be prepared differently than you are used to , b/c of the native cooking influences overall though , we were satisfied alcohol was great if you like fruity drinks , try the sammy sosa and everyone has to have the pina colada drink served in a coconut at least once if you like animals and nature , you will really like this resort there is a separate garden with a walking path on it , where i saw a lot of interesting flowers and plants there are turkey families , chicken families , flamingos , parrots , peacocks , ducks , turtles , koi , and small lizards often i would see a stray chicken or peacock , or a turkey family traversing the decks of peoples ' rooms or through the walkways between the buildings be careful of the parrots - as other reviewers have said as well , they bite , it hurts , and afterwards they laugh at you and say 'hello hello , etc ' ( at least that was my experience other things we liked included the pool hall , and outside sports bar , where guys would watch football some nights the cable reception was not that great on the hotel but you could at least see what was going on there are also things like archery and bike tours , but you have to ask about them the staff was great they were focused on pleasing you and had fun while doing it the hostesses and the bartenders were especially excellent , although the coctail waitress on the beach rocked - - she works so hard walking through the beach asking people if they would like drinks i hope they let her use the spa whenever she wants , b/c she sure deserves it one last thing - the guy in the middle of the resort on the beach that led games every day was very annoying and loud he could be heard on his microphone from all ends of the beach , which is a far distance we were hoping for more peace and quiet during the early and mid afternoons the way back to the airport was uneventful be careful when you get dropped off at the airport on your way back - guys wait to grab your bags from your vehicles without asking you , and expect to be paid for carrying them i am looking forward to going back to excellence again , as is my boyfriend i would go back again next year but my boyfriend wants to try mexico 
excellent vacation my husband and i vacationed dec 7 for 1 week i must say the hotel and gardens were beautiful , very lush and very well maintained our room was alittle musty as some of the other reviews mentioned although very clean and the service was great the restaurants were great , we liked toscana the best and also spice the beach was very well maintained and beautiful but the water was rough we actually were hit with tropical storm olga , which was very odd for the time of year it rained for 24 hours and very windy our room ceiling leaked from the room above they relocated us to another room within 20 minutes ( very timely in my opinion ) the new room was in the excellence club section ( building 11) , a nicer area in my opinion , more amenities and a nicer part of the beach the service was also great and all the staff were very helpful and friendly i would recommend this resort we liked that it was an adults only resort , very romantic 
this was a great place i am a travel agent and his is my 8th stay in punta cana we stayed at paradisus palma real in april and excellence in november both are 4 1/2 star properties , the only two in punta cana i have to say , i preferred excellence yes , the property is older so you ca not compare the rooms , however they both have the same ammenities i prefer excellence even with the age the distance from the airport is more for excellence but if you are staying a reasonable amount of nights it is okay we did a 3 night stay and i still feel it was worth it , as i can compare the two excellence , the food was excellent and so was the service the staff was excellent on all levels the best thing , multiple restaurants with no reservations needed drinks , premium and all bars had bartendars that were just great beach service for drinks also if you are english speaking , everyone speaks english they had beach games , pool games , basketball , pool tables , tennis , ping pong , bocce , chess , archery , and rifle i might be missing a few the entertainment at night was also well done i just loved this property the best of all the 8 stays 
loved the excellence my husband and i just returned from excellence we spent 12/6 - 12/12/07 there i was really worried after reading the reviews about the food , bug bites and pool towel shortage we had the perfect weather , no bug bite problem and towels were plentiful the pools are well taken care of i thought the food was excellent , and the staff was very friendly disco was great , top shelf liquor the entire stay the beach was clean , although you cannot do any sports in the water since it is very rough , you can however , get yourself wet and jump the waves housekeeping was great the first few days and then went quickly down hill no washcloths to be found , even on the laundry carts ( they are kept by the elevators on the first floor ) this resort is 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport , and i took pierto tour bus which was great it is a very remote resort shopping is great two feet off the resort on the beach , great bargains ( to the left of the beach ) i would recommend excellence , and will hopefully try one of their newer resorts all inclusive is def worth it 
this place is fabulous we were at excellence 12-5-07 to 12-12-07 and it was as wonderful as most of the reviews we read on trip advisor the room was gorgeous and clean ( yes , you do have to ask for washcloths ) the hotel itself was beautiful the pool and beach were cleaned daily the restaurants , we felt , were all good isabella was the best we loved the breakfast and lunch buffets , lots of choices the bars and bar service were exceptional jose at the beach bar and amado at the martini bar could not have been more friendly , fun , and efficient most shows were good the michael jackson one was exceptional the magic one was very lame be sure to catch domingo the sax player he is amazing the spa was beautiful , clean and well staffed rosa does a great massage and pedicure the grounds were well manicured and lush now , to the entertainment staff rey is the best he does an excellent job of helping people to have fun , get involved , and meet other people he has an amazing ability to remember names and faces and is tireless at his many duties contrary to what we read , we had no problem with mosquitos or any other insects a few suggestions if you are planning a trip to excellence bring lots of ones for tips we took our own beach towels to save our chaises at the pool try a dirty banana drink get involved in activities ( we met sooo many people that way ) take your own cheap washcloths and just pitch them at the end be careful with the wet/slippery tiles and marble and , oh yeah , enjoy it all patricia findlay , oh 
almost excellent - a travel consultant 's opinion i 'm a travel consultant and have been to many places in the caribbean and mexico so i have a lot of places to which i can compare this property overall , for the cost , it was great i took a group of 10 people ( mixed adult group of singles , couples , gay and straight ) and everyone had a really good time positives : food ( i have no idea what other all - inclusives anyone complaining about the food have been to ) , the property and grounds ( lovely ) and most of the staff negatives : distance from the airport , optional excursions ( we only left the resort once for horseback riding anything else that interested us at all was at least an hour and a half away ) and most anything else the place is really away from the hub bub of punta cana 's main hotel area which is both a positive and a negative depending on the person we had mixed emotions about the beach although very pretty to look at , the water was very rough some of us ( including myself ) had fun playing in the waves but some people did not get in at all because the black or red flag was flying every day , the water sports area would not give out boogie boards or any other water toys anyone looking for the typical aqua blue , calm caribbean water will be quite disappointed the spa was nice , too , though expensive worth the splurge though , for me anyway i would say 90% of the crowd is couples though the singles in our group much preferred this over kids which , of course , are not allowed here evenings were the main event of the day with people dressing smartly for dinner , cocktails and whatever entertainment was going on they have every top shelf booze i could think of and our glasses were never empty as stated above , everyone in our group thought the food for every meal was good to excellent my personal favorites were chez isabelle and the lobster house i would have been bored here for more than a week stay which was just about perfect in summary , i would highly recommend this property for anyone not looking to do a bunch of excursions and wanting a beautiful setting with good food , drinks and service 
a wonderful resort my husband and i just returned from a one week stay at excellence this was by far the best vacation overall we 've had ( including several carribean islands and europe ) my review will be quite lengthy i 'm sure but there really is so much one can say about this place i had read some horror stories from others in regards to the transfer from the airport to hotel we decided to book our transportation through excellence rather than deal with a large bus that made stops at other resorts leticia from concierge arranged this for us via email we landed at the airport ( which is really very pretty open style w/ thatched roofs ) without any problems we were greeted by a very pleasant man vertillio who was waiting for us outside of baggage claim he immediately took our luggage and walked us over to a new land cruiser equipped with soft leather seats he had cold towels waiting for us and 2 excellence bottled waters it was dark when we landed but the ride to our resort was surprisingly smooth we had great conversation with vertillio ( i speak some span he even stopped at a local drinking hole for us and we got a couple of ice cold presidente 's for the road total cost was $60 for transfer which i would highly recommend and ask for him when booking he was not available for our trip back so we had to take a cab last minute not nearly as relaxing it was the same $60 fee but the driver had an old beat up car with a huge crack on the windshield , practically no ac and everytime he stopped we prayed the brakes were not going to go b/c they were screaching the entire trip it was daylight on the way back so we could see more not really much to see other than cattle grazing , mountains off in the distance , and some shed type dwellings it was a little sad honestly what amazed us most is that there was not one street sign or traffic light i could not imagine ever renting a car here as the driver approached an intersection he would just lay on the horn as if to announce watch out i 'm coming through lots of mopeds weaving in and out as we were driving along too kids hitch - hiking on the side of the road on their way to school the resort itself as most others have written is absolutely beautiful the grounds are a landscape paradise perfectly groomed trees line the street as you approach the gated resort the flamingos , parrots , hens and other various wild life are fun to see the lobby is large and beautiful we were greeted at check in (8pm ) with 2 glasses of champagne and were quickly taken to our room by our bell - hop we booked a swim up suite 1st impression was very nice , but not 5 star the room had a musty smell and there was even a little mold growing above the sink on the ceiling in the bathroom ( as the wk went on we did not notice the smell at all ) nice tile work , clean , and spacious though we could literally walk out our room and dive into the cascading pool comfortable 4 poster bed nice large whirlpool tub , and stocked mini bar other positives housekeeping always kept the room clean they 'd put fresh flowers on our towels and turn down the bed at night i wrote a note requesting more diet coke and presidente and everyday they stocked us with more foodwise we went with low expectations as we 've never really had great food at any of the other all inclusives we 've been to excellence surpassed our expectations we enjoyed all the meals we had the service was great i liked that there were 7 restaurants to choose from ( one or two closed each night ) and an abundance of bars also nice not to have to deal with making reservations the day before as w/ other all inclusives you could eat when you felt like it i especially liked the trio who came to our table and sang at agave nice touch along with many other little touches/ ie/ the hostess walks the ladies over to tables arm and arm if i got up to use the bathroom , i 'd return to my table with my napkin folded i enjoyed being able to drink as much wine as we wanted with our dinner chez isabelle was also my favorite as many others have written i enjoyed my chateau briand although my husband thought his was chewy he loved the sushi at spice and we both loved the breakfast buffet they even had a guy playing piano one morning another nice touch , along w/ the bloody mary bar and mimosa station my favorite were the omelets there is a huge selection of food available at the buffet always i enjoyed that much of the dining was in an inclosed area b/c in the past other all inclusives we 've been to w/ outside eating had either too many bugs or birds waiting to get at your plate when you got up the entertainment at night was a lot of fun do not expect broadway but go with an open mind there are comfy wicker chairs ( find your seat early as they fill up fast ) and staff comes around throughout the show taking drink orders we went at the end of rainy season so i was expecting rain and lots of mosquitos from what i had read we packed off , after bite etc and never needed it once everyday was sunny and beautiful and not one bug always a nice breeze too we took advantage of room service on several occasions and often late at night ie/ after disco closed the food was always hot and tasty we also worked out almost daily at the gym which is inside the spa it 's adequate they have good music on and i liked how the 1st day when i got on an eliptical a staff member walked over and gave me a towel 
unbelievable this resort was amazing the staff was excellent we stayed in the excellence vip area of the resort but walked around the entire place and it was beautiful the food was amazing the beach was gorgious there are many adventures you can participate in , we went snorkling over the coral reef and with sharks and stingrays it was amazing horseback riding on the beach is a must i loved it there and cant wait for the chance to go back i will definently go back to this resort as you can tell the only word i keep repeating is amazing beacuse that is what it was you will definently enjoy it there 
kudos to excellence pc my husband and i traveled down to the dr for two weeks to celebrate our honeymoon , 40th birthday , graduation and a promotion so as you can see we had a lot to celebrate we arrived nov 22nd and our taxi driver ( arranged by a local on trip advisor ) was waiting with a sign ( our names on it ) he whisked us away to paradise the road is a little funky , but i have been on worse yes it?? about an hour to get there , but it is cool to look around and see the area before you get to your hotel get your driver to stop for cervezas on the way upon arrival you are greeted with a welcome home , and we were upgraded right away to a beautiful room overlooking the cascade pool i won?? go on and on about the service , you are going to have to take my word it was fabulous i can honestly say i have no complaints thanks to all staff ( amazing crew ) , i will mention benjamin , ines and jenny for there outstanding contribution to making our trip that good the dinner on the beach for $150 extra was well worth it we did this for my birthday and what a great memory before dinner we went to our room to shower and change to find the hotel had gone in and ran a jacuzzi , had balloons , candles , banners and a birthday cake waiting for me how cool is that information - don?? be alarmed after a week sometimes the key card needs to be re swiped , takes 2 minutes to run to the front desk to get that fixed our last night the safe wouldn?? open , so we called the front desk and someone was there within 10 minutes that is service , and in most hotels in canada you can?? get service that quick ????? the resorts food was some of the best i have ever tasted at an all - inclusive resort my personal favorites were chez isabelle?? and spice for all you that like to have the occasional romantic evening in the room , the room service was fabulous and they don?? mind delivering extra beer the beach was beautiful , very well groomed daily there was a red flag everyday , but that never stopped us as we had a riot playing in the waves watch the sand flees as those little things bite a lot unfortunately you will not know you have been bitten until later in the evening note : please remove your sunglasses and body jewelry we saw many people lose there stuff to the ocean the only excursion we did was the caribbean festival it was fun to swim with sharks and rays the trip is over an hour to get there and honestly wouldn?? do it again but we still had fun suggestions to bring : soap - bodyshampoo and conditioner ? you will want your ownmulti vitamins ? you will need to replenish your bodyhydrocortisone ? for any bug bitesadvil ? for those morningsclamato ? for you canadianssmall first aid kit for those bumps and scrapes ? mostly bandages and polysporinbug spray ? min 30 deetlots of suntan lotion ? at least a 30 and i travel a lot and needed itthe most important thing of all is to bring a great attitude we brought our sippy cups but honestly never even brought them out the cups are nice sizes and your drinks seem to get replaced every time you even got close to the bottom of the glass other guests - we met people from all over the world ( to many names to mention ) and i must say thank you to all of you for contributing to our vacation and memories it was an honor to meet you all i would highly recommend this resort to anyone i forgot to mention how nice it was not to have to worry about children to all traveling have a safe and relaxing trip wherever you go please don?? hesitate to pm me if you have any questions or concerns 
loved this place first let me say that i 've been reading reviews on trip advisor about excellence for a year now i began planning this trip in 2006 as a surprise 25th anniversary trip for me and my husband the main reason i selected excellence is because of the no children factor now on to the review after reading many reviews over the course of the year , the general concensus was that the food was just okay ( some said inedible ) but service and grounds were beautifully kept and that upgrading to the excellence club was not worth it i did upgrade to the excellence club and it was well worth it upon arrival you are wisked away to a private airconditioned club (2 floors - bottom are private bathrooms and concierge top there is unending fruit , food , bread , coffee , tea , drinks , tv , balcony , etc you are treated like royalty we were then taken to our rooms with our luggage - thanks to tony rooms - the rooms are average while the decor is beautiful - cathedral ceilings , ceiling fan , balcony overlooking pool and ocean , jacuzzi , shower , etc - they could use a little sprucing up and the resort was doing so on the lower levels a fresh coat of paint and some upgrades were taking place while we were there it is amazing how well stocked the mini bar is and they come around 2 times a day to replenish top shelf liquor , water , juices , etc staff - nothing to say except excellente they are beautiful people inside and out and truly love what they do food - never had a bad meal chez isabella the best - at there twice agave second favorite - margaritas and chips delicious toscano - wonderful the grill - very good the lobster house - very good ( of course you get spiny lobsters not maine - after all you 're in punta cana ) spice - fair our least favorite but still good beach grill during the day was also very good entertainment - the shows in the evening were fun chris blizzard our favorite ca not wait to download his christmas album michael jackson review - it could have been him for all we know audience games/participation very funny we did not go to the disco and were told to stay away from the casino as it has nothing to do with the resort it 's an independent casino that rents the space and they say they take you for everything you have beach - amazing there are beds on the beach - go figure it was wonderful the water is extremely rough had a horrifying experience with someone almost drowning my husband and a few other men on the beach went out and dragged him back in - good job guys you are waited on hand and foot and the beach with drinks galore pool - amazing never had to fight for a chair , towel , etc always a spot open with plenty of pool floats we did take a trip off the resort to saona island well worth it although the bus ride there was 90 min it was still excellente from the bus they put you on a speed boat to a katamaran for about 1 that was truly fun - drinking , dancing , singing they drop you onto the island where you have lunch and swim in the caribbean - just beautiful and lunch was good from island on speedboats to an area in the middle of the carribean to look for starfish - we found several back to the bus on speedboat - very fun check out - made easy thanks to the excellence club and carlos this trip was truly paradise i highly recommend 
wonderful relaxing stay for dee and ray from georgia we spent eight days of wonderful bliss , the staff was far better than any resort we have stayed the setting is absolutely immaculate our room was a jr suite overlooking the ocean , i would highly recommend the pools were very well taken care of with nice floats to lounge on someone was always asking if they could help i felt like we were being treated as a queen and king all the resturants were good , everyone has their favorite we really liked the toscan , the grill , chez , all of them were good the rooms were very clean , the special touches they do for turn down were nice , with the flower petals and the towels made into swans if you needed anything they were there , all you had to do was ask we enjoyed the shows , especially chris blizzard , , the circus , all of them were good it was an adult resort which was very nice , met a lot of very nice people from all over the world it was nice not to have to wear that silly braclet , no reservations and very little waiting to be seated at the resturants if at all the gift shops were very nice , the peope were not pushy at all our tour rep , johnny , was outstanding , the best 
one of our best resorts excellence punta cana is on a beautiful secluded , uncrowded and well maintained beachfront property perfect for a romantic adults only vacation we have stayed at over 10 different all inclusive 4 or 5star in the caribean this is our favorite so far where else to go after such a luxury resort for the price since the standards of service were so high at the excellence punta cana , we will book excellence in the mayan in february beach : we enjoyed the waiters that served drinks and pizza on the beach and pool area they were very prompt at keeping the area free of empty glasses and litter no cigarette butts in the sand , there is a ashtray - flower pot at each cabana lots of towels and lounge chairs around the pool and beach note the undertow in the ocean can be strong pool : clean , long and many floating mats and loungers availablerestaurants : dinner all a la carte except buffet at one restaurant on domincain republic theme night no reservations required for a la carte restaurants just show up between the open hours if there is a waiting time , they supply you with a beeper when a table is available for you you can relax , follow no appointments like back home leave your watches in your luggage and enjoy your vacation the food was freshly prepared , very tasty and with a nice presentation at all the six restaurants we attended breakfast and lunch were buffet style , clean serving dishes and not over cooked food animation : energetic polite , friendly but mostly they did respect your wish if you would prefer to relax and only watch inez , mariel andre and mostly rey made us feel welcome and happy to be on vacation with them at this resort evenings : before the show , they did play those silly games on stage but they were never insulting or degrading games for the guest such as we have seen at other resorts the evening main shows were of good quality since the shows were not put on only by animation team but rather invited entertainers disco : the animations team even stayed at the disco for 1 1/2 hours they would dance with the guests they were probably very tired , but they did not let that stop them my favorite part is that i i would get to dance latino salsa , meringue to local songs with a dominican flair ca not do that back home in our clubsexcellence deserves to be number 1 resort of punta cana they will do what you need to make this your best vacation you can trust them with your vacation 
if you book this place you " ll regret it sweet drinks , salty food and inconsistent servicemy wife and i thought we were big fans of the excellence resorts , especially after our stay at the excellence riviera maya in mexico in november of 2006 the property , as well , as the service were impeccable and of the highest quality we were so impressed with the excellence experience , we could not wait to book at the highly touted excellence in punta cana , dominican republic , supposedly the top rated hotel on the island we just got back from our stay there from november 11 through 19th it was , to say the least , extremely poor my wife and i were placed in a room with twin beds married couple on vacation??ome on then we were moved to a ground floor handicapped room , complete with mosquitoes , ants , cockroaches and one night , we left the room for dinner and turndown came in and did not secure our door , leaving our belongings exposed to anyone walking by from 6pm to our return at midnight ( four hours ) i called to the front desk and spoke to the mod he assured me that an investigation would be conducted and i?? be informed of the results???? still waiting to hear from him to add insult to injury , the next day , the maid left the sliding door to the rear of the room unlocked after making the room late in the day we left the room at 8am every morning and returned at 4pm the rooms were never made in this 8 hour time period the food and beverage was just as disappointing our first dinner at the french restaurant , we ordered chateaubriand rare cut at tableside it was plated in the back and given to us well done when we brought it to the waiters attention , we were stunned to here him suck his teeth in a huff??ike we were inconveniencing him it seemed like the staff just couldn?? get it right order a mimosa , get orange and cranberry juice little things like that annoy you when your on vacation especially , when the staff doesn?? care there are plenty of stories like these that occurred throughout the week unfortunately , the few people that did care about service were overshadowed by the many who could care less the drinks at the bar were watered down the gym was outdated , dirty and much of the equipment was in disrepair the place smelled of musty sweat the spa wasn?? even in the same league at the riviera maya on the beach , there was a shortage of towels , everyday as a former assistant manager with a major canadian luxury hotel chain , this was an extremely bad excuse for a two - star hotel , never mind a four initially , we were sold on the excellence brand , looking forward to booking in isla mujeres and oyster bay locations upon opening now , we??e convinced the quality experience in southern cancun is not a standard with all their properties needless to say , we will not be returning to the dominican republic , and this is certainly our last booking with excellence resorts , altogether their corporate office fluffed off our concerns when we brought them to their attention apparently , they don?? seem care either perhaps , we??l pay a bit more and book a sure thing like sandals next time sincerely , david and joanne terestre 
a wonderful vacation had by all this was our third year at excellence and by far the best year we had 4 couples in our group first the negative : i am a little disappointed with the hotel and there willingness to accommodate the larger groups i understand its a couples resort , however we were not the only group there with this complaint a group of 8 is by no means a hard group to seat so a few of the restaurants were able to do this and some wouldnt the hotel is under construction : one building is for sure i didnt notice more im hoping the rest of the resort is under construction at one point as well as much as i love the resort , it is in need of a face lift for lack of better words its a tad outdated and while some rooms appeared nicer then others , i *might* be willing to chalk it up to the maid service its very incosistent out of the four of us couples , we all had different issues with the maid service our room was ok there were flower petals on out bed when we checked in , which cause a swarm of ants on the bed and all the linens not to mention , two of our rooms we found roaches our honeymoon suite , which had a hot tub in it on the belcony , totally outdated not worth the money at all didnt even work when we first checked in the beds were made in a timely fashion , and towels replenished the food is the lobster house was not very good we were very dissapointed the food over all was pretty decent the french rest was fantastic spice was to die for omg we loved it the lobster house and the grillcould be best left out the entertainment team made the whole trip and will probably be the only reason we go back , if thats what we decide to do rey , ines , andre , and wilkins are wonderful they are just the friendliest , funniest and most hard working people ive ever seen they positivley made the trip the most awesome time we ever had they for certain dont make enough for what they do the over - all staff at excellence was amazing a few bad eggs , but as a group , wow the people are just , i cant say it enough , amazing victor in the breakfast area in the morning and he works at spice at night , was such a nice guy always smiling and happy odani , martinez , ramon , all bartenders just funny and friendly over all , it was a great time 
beautiful , would return , but has some problems i took my mother to excellence for her birthday it was originally scheduled as a couples trip , but that did not work out almost everyone is a couple , but i did not feel uncomfortable the entrance process at the airport was very smooth and quick we had a prearranged transport bus they usually make multiple stops at various resorts , so if you do not want to do that , you may want to take a cab ( $65) the ride was worse than i expected , even after reading all the reviews the road was only partially paved in areas , and huge potholes were all along it we were told that local traffic had been routed onto the road due to repairs our ride took 90 minutes , even with no stops at other resorts when we arrived at excellence , check - in was quick we were not greeted with champagne and warm towels , as other guests were the lobby and other common areas were very nice we had a problem with our room since we were not a couple , we had requested a room with two beds they explained that i would not get the upgrade i paid for , and that we would have to wait until the next day to move our first room was very nice , bld 2, with a great ocean view unfortunately , groups of drunk people ran up and down the breezeways from 11 pm until 3 am , yelling , etc we were happy to move to a quieter section of the hotel ( bld it was a garden view , still very nice the main problems we had were with the front desk in the new room , the safe did not work , and the front door to the room would not close we had to call twice to get anyone to come , and they take their time the front desk offered us some kind of compensation ( their suggestion ) for changing rooms , but gave us nothing , and told us no when we asked about it later on the day of our departure , we called twice to have our luggage brought to the lobby both time we were told someone was en route , but no one ever showed up we ended up taking it ourselves , and were almost late getting it on the bus ( after waiting so long for the bellman ) the grounds , pools , and beach were immaculate and beautiful the water directly in front of the resort was too rough to swim ( i am a strong swimmer ) , but a ten minute walk in either direction led to much calmer water poolside/beach drink service was spotty , but the bars are close by at the pools we did tip our servers , but it did not change the level of service you do have to grab a couple of towels early , and if you want to sit in a certain area , save your chairs with your towels we could usually find a float when we wanted one the dinner meals were excellent we did not eat at the grill ( ate there for lunch often ) , or agave we never had to wait , but we are early eaters after 7-7:30 pm , you might have to wait , especially at chez isabelle the breakfast and lunch food was pretty standard all - inclusive fare there is no outdoor cafe , which is quite inconvenient one day i went inside , got pizza , and brought it out to the pool apparently the servers will deliver it , but only to certain areas of the pool ( ours told us no ) we did tip our dinner servers , and our lunch servers when we had them at breakfast , someone will bring you one beverage , but after that , you 're pretty much on your own you can get your own juice/bloody mary/mimosas the animals at the resort are darling we had good timing , because the turkeys , a peahen , and multiple chickens had babies there are flamingos , ducks , turtles , and parrots do not touch the parrots the seem tame and friendly , but they are not one of them clawed and pecked my head , and bit my finger the activities people are great we did water aerobics every day with andreas and rey they also had lots of games and pool activities , if you want to join i enjoyed the free horseback riding it says you get 30 minutes , but we got 45-60 minutes the michael jackson show was worth watching we watched to 70s -80s show , and it was not very good not worth the mosquito bites we used tons of mosquito spray , but still got about 10-15 bites each the resort shops are pretty lame the beach vendors are too aggressive , and seemed quite dodgy they allow vendor booths at the resort on tue , thur , and sun we did buy some items there , and were able to bargain for less than half the original ( ridiculous ) prices they give you the swim - up rooms seemed really nice if i go again , i will book one bld 1,3, and 4 are more private by the small pool the others are closer to the action at the main pools i did not find the resort workers to be all that friendly , but they were not unfriendly , either the service was adequate to good most people there did not seem to speak any language but spanish , so brush up before you go if you want to chat probably our biggest regret was taking the helicopter back to the airport it is $200 per person , and definitely not worth the money you are supposed to get a 25 minute tour we got 15 minutes , max a vip travel agent was supposed to meet us , give us our luggage ( which we had to personally watch get put on the bus ) , and take us to check - in sounded great to us no one met us , we were dropped at some remote helipad , and no one spoke english at all through workers pointing and whistling , we went to what looked like a waiting area 
almost excellent but will not return my wife and i stayed at excellence from dec 1 thru dec 8 while we had a very nice time i will explain at the end why we would not return lets list all the excellent features the service staff is absolutely superb they are so well trained , so caring and they always smile whether in the restaurants or activities these employees truly enjoy what they do and that is not easy to accomplish the food was generally good and among our favorites were going to chez isabelle this is not high quality food as we know it in new york city but it was actually well prepared the pastry chef was wonderful the array of desserts and breads were baked fresh daily and they were wonderful the pool area was very nice and staff was extremely accomodating whether you wanted drinks or just fresh towels the beach was pretty but the big negative for us was the ocean water the waves are so rough that it is very difficult to swim and i think we were there on a relatively calm weather week with nothing but perfect weather if you walk about 1/4 mile to the right you will find some pockets of calmer water but this is not on the excellence property the shows were actually fairly good for the most part and definitely better than a cruise ship so here were our big negatives although the overall experience was fine we were discappointed in the rooms , we thought for a 5 star property , the rooms would be more elegantly appointed which they were not the buildings themselves were very mundane looking but as others have said , how much time do you really spend indoors when the weather is beautiful the clientele was a true walk of all lives my wife and i are fairly outgoing and like to make conversation with others , we found most people were not willing to speak but kept to themselves i think we thought we would see more new yorkers there , but in fact there were very few some simple request like a newspaper we were told was only for excellent club members and while i wanted to pay for it , i was not permitted to purchase it my wife is a big drinker of decaffinated coffee and the food  beverage manager told us they do not carry this , so bring your own if you want it brewed all in all we had a relaxing week , but the big negative was the absence of a calm relaxing carribean waters which we so look forward to 
cheers for the excellence a wonder place for couples , honeymooners and adults of all ages the hotel room was fabulous and spacious , king size bed , jacuzzi tub , marble bathroom sliding doors to a private balcony overlooking the ocean the hotel had wonderful shows , activities , and included a 30 min horseback riding and 30 min bike tour with your stay we met many friendly folk from the us and europe and all were very pleased with the excellence on our excursions away from the hotel we always felt safe and met others that were staying at other all inclusives they saidthefood at their hotel was 'good ' not at the excellence , there the food isspectacular wonderfully presented and most tasteful you would be lying on the beach and theycome around and offer drinks , pizza and fajitas for example a truely wonderful vacation , run just like a cruise ship and just as efficient 
wonderful honeymoon hotel we loved this resort we stayed 7 nights and it was perfect we payed a little extra for the excellence club check - in and check - out were in a separate club , and were much more efficient than regular check - in and check - out we were greeted on our arrival , told the concierge our name , and immediately taken to the excellence club they gave us champagne and cold washcloths , we signed one piece of paper , and were taken straight to our room we did not really use the excellence club the rest of the week as a member , you could eat breakfast there , but it was the same breakfast they served in the main restaurant we used the free internet in the club we also had a private concierge 24 hrs a day to help us with any needs he was very helpful , always gracious we got an ocean view room we did not get the honeymoon package , but we could not imagine being treated any better the housekeeper turned down our bed every day they restocked the mini bar and fridge every day we had a jacuzzi tub and separate shower , a huge king - sized bed , fresh fruit daily ( apples and pears ) , a balcony that overlooked the ocean and pool it was very comfortable and clean , beautifully decorated everything we could have asked for the two pools were amazing the large pool winds through the resort it is crossed by several bridges , surrounded by beds and chairs , has a swim up bar , and plenty of rafts to float on the waterfall pool had less people it was a good place to go to get away from everyone the only thing we did not like was that the pools close at 6pm for cleaning the resort was very quiet if you wanted , you could be a recluse for an entire week and no one would bother you room service menu was excellent , especially the desserts the three milk cake was our favorite there were also a ton of activities impossible to get bored if you are a very active person we did horseback riding , the atv ride , boogie boarding and snorkeling the all cost a little extra , but reasonable , especially compared to how much things cost in the states we did the horseback ride at sunset our guide was very gracious to take pictures of us with our camera the atv ride was two hours long we went up into the mountains , past a bunch of farmland , through one of the nearby towns , and to a beautiful cave in the middle of town it was very interesting and informative about the way dominicans actually live the majority are very poor our guide was obviously very proud of his country and often stopped on the side of the road to point out something interesting it rained on us a couple of times , but it was over in a minute or so ( it actually rained every day , for a little while in the afternoon but the rest of the day the weather was gorgeous i imagine the atv ride would be very hot and uncomfortable if you were there in the middle of summer , b/c there was almost no shade on the road boogie boarding was alot of fun the waves in october were perfect for it it was cheap too ( like $5 for one hour snorkeling was a bit of a failure be sure you do not go on a windy day the boat that takes you out is very small and more than one person got sick the reef is not in a cove , it is out in the middle of the ocean , and the water was very rough the day we went we came back early , b/c 3 out of the 6 ppl in our group were hanging over the side of the boat but i did look under the water for a minute and the reef and fish were absolutely gorgeous there were seven restaurants to pick from : italian , french , mediterranean , asian , mexican , and the lobster grill we did not visit the asian or mexican ones all of the others were fabulous the italian was our favorite the atmosphere at the french place was the most romantic the wine list was excellent at all of them the waiters were all very gracious the entree ' servings tend to be smaller than american portions , so order an appetizer ( or you can order two entrees it 's an all - inclusive ) look at the resort flyers ahead of time ( you get one in your room each day ) and plan your dinners , b/c some of the restaurants close on certain nights breakfast was amazing it was a huge buffet with everything you can imagine the smoothies are custom made to order , as well as the omelets at the omelet station there was a man playing the piano during breakfast every morning it was a beautiful way to wake up and start your day for lunch , we mostly ate at the grill everything we had there was good they offered ( for an extra fee ) a candlelit dinner for two on the beach we did not see anyone taking advantage of it the whole time we were there we did not do it b/c there were a lot of gnats on the beach at that time of the evening the beach was gorgeous prettier than anywhere in florida and way less crowded and touristy than waikiki there was no trash , no kids , no seaweed , no jellyfish , no rocks the sand was not too hot and the wind was a light breeze the water temperature was perfect in october 
we stayed at excellence for 9 nights and it was fabulous firstly , the hour long journey from the airport is not that bad , at least you get to see some of the real countryside and how the locals live the hotel itself is beautiful with great gardens and water features all around it is very well looked after , there is always someone working away in the background our room was perfect , while not as luxurious as we thought we had no complaints with it , except for the lack of soap lucky we had brought our own there was always plenty of towels and a full mini bar the staff were all very pleasant and went out of their way to help nothing is a problem and everything is done to make your stay as relaxing as possible we loved the pool and the swim up bar the beach is spotless , perfect for walking and great fun to swim although the waves were huge the breakfast and lunch were great - a wide choice and something to suit everyone our favourite restaurants were spice and chez isabelle and while the food is not 5 star by our standards it was perfectly pleasant and we never went hungry i have never seen such a variety of drinks available - every type of cocktail under the sun and all served with a smile be sure to check out jose at cafe kafe for a bit of a laugh only caught bits of the night time shows but the international show looked pretty good also enjoyed domingo on the saxaphone while having a drink outside in the evening bring mosquito spray with deet - i am prone to bites but only got very few with this stuff overall a fantastic start to our honeymoon - would certainly recommend it 
best vacation yet if you want a wordy review there are plenty here that is one of the ways we selected this hotel everything was great we had upgraded accomodations and the excellence club which was great the food was great ( except for the french restaurant which we did not like at all ) the room was great and the people were great i enjoyed the altantic ocean typically on my vacations , the caribean is too calm the waves in the atlantic were fun i swam in it every day even the nightly shows were very nice our excellence club representative , carlos , went out of his way to make us happy my favorite bar tenders carlos m and jose were friendly and fun and made wonderfull drinks the one activity that really disappointed me was the horse back riding if you see chris on the beach , tell him you 'll pay when you are done ( if you like it ) the ride was nothing great and they tried to sell you stuff at the end there were also a bunch of beach vendors trying to sell stuff other than that , i would definitely recommend this place and will probably go back 
specifics on everything we went lookng for a mindless relaxing vacation excellence was just that the accommodations were superb we had a garden view room on the 2nd floor we do not tend to spend a great deal of time in the room , so a view is not important we did have a nice balcony with a view of attractive gardens the room was very well equipped with kingsize bed , jacuzzi , stocked bar and snacks tv worked most of the time and on occasion we received phone calls at 2am or so just to find out if everything was okay ( we thought that was an odd occurence room was clean and well kept the last 2 days the turn down service seemed non - existent the shower could 've been a bit larger , and there should be a wall between the sink area and bed area so that in the middle of the night if you have to get up , you do not wake the person with you the food was fantastic having 7 restaurants to choose from was great we were always excited to try something different we soon found out that although we enjoyed eating outdoors , breakfast inside at toscana was much better than the choices at the lobster house the same applies for lunch buffet choices at toscana were far better than the few choices ( only the caribbean shrimp was good ) at the grill dinners at each restaurant were superb our least favorite were agave and the grill agave was the mexican restaurant and it was closed every other day as barcelona ( the mediterrean restaurant ) was housed in the same building the choices were unbelievable and the service unsurpassed the alcohol was top shelf flowing at all times and so many different bars to choose from each had their own flair i was able to have kir royales all week my husband enjoyed top shelf scotch we had several different choices of wine with lunch and dinner everyday you could have anything you wanted - anything at all the pool was beautiful - clean , convenient , and the center of the resort you could be in the heart of activity or you could be down on the far end in quiet , solitude there were tons of shade palapas everywhere there was another quieter pool area on the other side of the lobby with it 's own flavor and friendliness the activity staff was wonderful they were so friendly , welcoming and happy there were some very noticeable staff members who really worked to make sure everyone was satisfied with every aspect of entertainment my first encounter was with inez who grabbed me to play a game and made me feel like she was a long lost friend i was back to visit she and rosmery were my buddies who made sure i was having fun then there was rey , the hard - bodied stretch and aqua gym leader the aqua aerobics was the finest workout i 've had in a pool it was not just splashing fun and games , it was a workout rey was fun and encouraging franklin , mi amigo , was my personal spanish tutor i knew no spanish when i arrived and after 5 days of lessons i feel i can converse in spanish i went to lessons each morning at 10:30 and sometimes there were others there and if not , franklin was sure to hold a full lesson anyway and answer any and all my questions anytime i saw him at the resort , day or night , he was available to help and give me a quick reminder really , we have been to 4 other all inclusives and this one by far had the happiest friendliest staff and best service now , one complaint we booked this resort based on it 's service , food , accommodations , and watersports unfortunately , there are no water sports most of the time the ocean is very rough each day there was a red flag - no swimming most average swimmers would not venture into the fierce ocean it seemed there were areas around where there may have been a reef to hold back the fierceness that was not the case at excellence the watersports desk would not even allow anyone to take flippers or any sail boats , windsurfs or anything because it 's downright dangerous so , if it 's snorkeling , sailing or ocean sports you enjoy , this is not the resort for you if it 's relaxation , great food , great drinks , great service , great fun around a pool , then this is the place for couples of any age casino is small and only takes money in the disco was for the younger at heart and the staff was great when in the disco - got everyone going the shows were good the best were the chris blizzard show and the michael jackson and circus shows the ice - breakers are cute get up and participate it 's fun 
nothing too much trouble date : 30 november 2007marg  nigel , guernsey ukwe have just returned from our first , but certainly not our last , visit to the excellence punta cana whilst my wife and i had been seeking an all - inclusive resort for adults only , with plenty of sun and a beach , the excellence provided these and so much more undoubtedly the staff make the resort work - always on hand and so helpful , nothing was too much trouble the food in all restaurants was very good at the least , and occasionally excellent with an executive head chef like bernhard this was not surprising he was willing to explain the local delicacies and quite obviously had much to offer after his experiences in top restaurants and hotels across the world the list of the good points are many and our one week stay went too quickly as a couple , we felt totally relaxed with no pressure to join in the numerous daily activities often content to enjoy the cocktail of the day whilst watching the staff lay on entertainment for those able and willing the evening shows were exceptional , as evidenced by the full houses each night overall , the resort delivered as it promised , excellence thank you to the many staff who ensured we enjoyed our brief stay 
nice stay at excellence booked the trip through cheap caribbean , which was very smooth only downside was that the pickup for the airport on the way back was super early (10am for a 2:30pm flight ) which made us lose a few hours on the last day punta cana is a beautiful resort the pool is one of the nicest i 've been to and the beach is very private and picturesque with tons of palm trees around food was overall very good - favorite restaurants were barcelona and chez isabelle loved the ambiance of barcelona more i also loved the huge jacuzzi tub in the room horseback riding on the beach was really nice , even though the horses were small and super slow loved playing tennis everyday and enjoyed all the games in the sports area - rifle shooting , table tennis , foosball , archery since we 're pretty sporty , some of the organized activities were too beginner level for us - volleyball , yoga , dancing , etc so we did not participate we also could not do any water sports because the currents were too dangerous i was disappointed that we could not do the non - motorized water sports as advertised , but it was nice just relaxing on the beach - contrary to what other people wrote on here , most of the people we encountered did not seem that friendly we felt like the more senior staff members were nice , but the lower level staff seemed like they did not really like their jobs they tried to fake a smile but they did not really seem like happy people - probably cuz it 's a third world country after all we did encounter certain people who were very nice , including our waiter at barcelona and the guy at the front desk who made sure to move us when we got a room that was very smokey in general we felt like dr is kind of a depressing place for people who live there and even though excellence is a great all inclusive resort , it 's not a place we would go back to 
loved the excellance my husband and i spent 2 weeks and had a great time having gone rightafter the storm we had more mosquitos than usual , make sure you bring bug spray we wanted a place where we could just relax and being alittle secluded it was perfect the beach and hotel are beautiful although most reviews were high on the food , that was the only area wefelt was lacking it was ok but feel consistancy was lacking and hot was never hot and cold not really cold i can not say enough good things about the staff , they are terrific rey , inez , rosemary , pierreand jenny i feel i have made new friends and will always remember them having brought them back home in my heart would go back again tomorrow 
excellent service i 've just return from a week stay at the excellence punta cana i would rate the resort itself as in above average , as the rooms and food were between 3 1/2 to 4 stars the thing that makes this resort a 5 star in my opinion is the service i cannot say enough about the service the genuine care and kindness that the hostess at the main  excellence club showed was impeccable ( kary , fiordaliza leticia , jackeline and franklin ) if you stay at this resort you will have a great stay , as i stated the service in great i could go on and on about the people above and other within the entertainment group ( ines , rey and mariel ) , and other throughout the resorts but the ones above made this vacation one of best i will continue to visit the resort is the property continues to employee such people as noted above i would also like to say a special thanks to santos from the excellence club lounge so , if you are looking for a great place to stay where not only the place itself is above average , but the people that they employee puts the resort in a class by itself??ick the excellence i??e already started looking into dates for my next visit also as a note the food ( is not to say that the food was bad ) , it just that the room service a few other menu items could stand some improvements and the rooms i would guess normal wear and tear and the bedding can be improved/upgraded 
my husband and spent our honeymoon last week at the excellence in punta cana we had a great time and would go back again here are some highlights and some things that i would have liked to have known before our stay ( in no particular order ) book your airport transfer before you go we booked with prieto tours and were whisked away as soon as we got to the airport we were given an overview the next morning by johnny he was great he was available at the desk everyday during our stay and we asked him lots of questions it gave us a great piece of mind have a lot of ones on you when you arrive the hotel can give you change during your stay but we tipped a lot before we even got there excellence was beautiful always clean and well cared for be careful of wet floors i slipped and hurt my knee and everyone we talked to knew someone that slipped it rained all week but we still had a great time we enjoyed eating , drinking and just playing games in the lobby ( santo domingo plaza ) if you see someone with a green shirt , you can ask them for a game curl up on a comfy couch and they will serve you drinks all day long get out early to reserve your favorite spot at the pool people complain about this , but hey , if everyone is doing it the food is kinda weird some things are very good and some things are just missing dont expect too much from the seafood , especially the caribbean lobster ( it 's not maine we thought they did beef very well especially in chez isabelle ( our favorite ) get the chateau briand - yum we didnt care for the room service , but the hot dogs when you come out of the disco are delicious everyone that works at excellence is so nice we tipped all the time but they never make you feel like you need to our favorite server was kelvin at chez isabelle what a wonderful man we wanted to bring him home with us our other favorite person was franklin from the activities team he sat with us and put up with my 100 questions about the dominican culture he is very smart and his english is advanced for only working there 10 months we also had a blast with him at the disco later that night he danced with me and talked my husband into participating in the beer chugging contest ( which he won ) also , our housekeeper juanita ( building 10) was so nice and friendly i never met the minibar attendant , but we loved him too we did the snorkeling ( caribbean festival ) being from florida , we thought it wasnt very good too crowded and not much to look at the boat was fun we did enjoy the 4- wheelers and swimming in the cave we thought it would be romantic to share a 4- wheeler but there is nothing romantic about what it does to your butt we cancelled our horse back riding - it was too much with the 4- wheeling it takes along time to get out to the difference excursions johnny nicely refunded our money we booked a massage instead it was wonderful the spa is beautiful we had no problems maybe because we didnt go to the beach much - just the pool not sure but i was blown away to read about the mosquitos on here maybe we arent sweet enough worth the upgrade amazing food all day we ate breakfast there everyday and grabbed delicious happy hour treats for our room they take care of anything and everything it was nice to have the computer access and the bartender was great i would definately reccomend it if you can afford to do it or it is something special , like a honeymoon i think that 's the hightlights overall , we thought the resort was beautiful we had lots of rest and lots of fun we ca not wait to go back and take all of our friends 
not close to what we expected wow , where do i start i went for a week with my boyfriend to celebrate my 30th birthday drive from the airport to the hotel took approximately 50 minutes and was not a smooth ride they drive very fast too if you get motion sickness this will not be for you staff at hotel were friendly , room was nice except it always felt damp even with the air condition on , and food was just ok french restaurant was by far the best did not like the italian and received the wrong order room service was alright , they forgot something from our order 2 out of 4 times we ordered the grounds were well kept and the pools were very nice the beach does not have white sand and the ocean is very rough you will not be able to kayake at this resort or snorkle they told us they would have to take us to another resort if we wanted to kayake you can use a boogie board for up to an hour and then it will cost you $10 each additional hour they do not have surfboards to rent it took a long time for staff to serve you drinks on the beach even when you tip the drinks are really weak but do taste good mosquitos are really bad and they will bite you even if you put repellant on not very pleaseant we went on the jeep excursion which was a entire day excursion we were very upset because we told the host whom you book your excursions with at the hotel , that we wanted the jeep to ourselves  no other passengers he told us that we would have to pay an additional person in order for us to have the jeep to ourselves he spoke english very well and understood us well , once we had taken a 60 min drive to where the excursion started they told us we would have to share the jeep with another couple the host lied to us to make more money after reviewing our receipt of payment more closely we relized that the host only charged us for 2 people instead of 3 so , at that point we had no choice and we had to share the jeep with another couple that did not speak english that well my boyfriend only was able to drive the jeep for about 45min the entire trip the only positive thing that we got out of this excursion was that we really were able to see the culture of this country and the beautiful trees , plants ,  mountains you will visit a sugar cane field , tobacco museum , school , ranch , home of a domincan family ,  beach at the ranch they will provide you with lunch , which i was unable to eat ( dry meat , rice/beans , fruit  bread ) flies were landing all over the food not much of a lunch so you should pack a lunch if you decide to do this excursion after lunch you can choose to take a 30 min horse back ride or just wait where you eat lunch we decided to wait since we did the horseback ride at our resort the day before the wait was a good 1 hour 45 min because they did not have enough horses to take everyone at the same time the beach was nothing special vendors selling items on the beach and water was not very clear needless to say we were glad we got to see the culture , although it did not need to be an entire day excursion we were going to book another excusion , but after finding out that all the excursions are an hour drive from the hotel on terrible roads we decided not to the host talked us out of the swimming with the dolphins excursion because he told us that one of the dolphins had bitten one of the guests who really knows if that was true after all he lied to us about getting a jeep to ourselves he was not very friendly after we told him we were upset about not having our own jeep and at that point he stated he must have misunderstood us to sum it all up , we will not be back to this resort nor punta cana it was not at all what we expected 
excellent stayed at excellence , nov joel and betty nhit was a great vacation for us a couple in our young 50s we enjoyed the beach , with long walks in both directions for miles we never felt unsafe off the property on the beach the beach in front of the resort was very rough , and think the resort should have a motorized craft to rescue swimmers that are caught by the undertow we found the nearby beaches to the right and left of the resort much calmer and better for swimming i did bring fishing gear and found the beach to the left of the resort best for fishing i used light spinning tackle and small spoons and caught jacks and a snapper , giving the fish to the workers at the next resort or to a local fisherman we took 3 excursions , the bavarro splash (2 seater speed boats with snorkeling ) , the atv tour from the hotel , and the atv tour off property the trip to speed boats and snorkeling was far , ( over 1 hour ) by bus to get to the area as this was on caribean side of island not atlantic where excellence is located but did enjoy the experience we liked both atv tours which were very different , the one at the hotel going to a village and the other going to a small trail through the countryside the food at excellence was great , we enjoyed the restaurants and loved not just going to a buffet for dinners the deserts were great ( and we are generally not desert eaters ) we didnt like the shows much , and usually left in the middle , a real negative for us was smoking of cigars and cigarettes at the shows other times this was not an issue we really liked the entertainment before the show domingo the sax player was just great , and we also liked the band ( cuban type ) that played a few nights we have found few resorts to have any entertainment after dinner and before the shows and this was exceptional here the staff here is exceptional , and all really seemed to enjoy pleasing the guests management staff were always around tweeking things to ensure everything was excellente we didnt have much problems with the mosiquitos , but others did , not sure why we were spared pool was gorgeous , although it would have been better if more people were considerate regarding reserving chairs , and pool floats for the day we never had a problem getting a lounger by the pool or beach just were annoyed at some of the prime spots being reserved for the whole day with little to no use we found the resort guests to be mostly english speaking coming from the us , canada , and england which was different than other resorts in punta cana where we were told there were a lot of european guests with english speaking being in the minority almost all of the staff spoke english we did have a lot of rain this week and probably 3 days of the week from 1pm on it rained we were glad we were early risers and got at least half a day of good weather in overall a great hotel and vacation 
excellent but would not stay again this is a difficult review because one negative ( mosquitoes ) totally overwhelms all or our positive feelings about this nearly perfect resort let me explain we stayed at the excellence for 10 days ( nov 6 - 16) and would agree with almost all the other reviews that speak of the resort in glowing terms yes , food , service , the staff , the physical facility , ambiance is all world - class wonderful but , i cannot overstate the problem they have with mosquitoes after more than 40 years of extensive international travel we have never seen anything to rival the insects at excellence as i sit in my family room ( we returned last evening ) nursing my more than 100 bites ( probably an understatement ) i will first speak about the positives from the moment we arrived to our last minute the staff at excellence were simply wonderful , amazing , professional , etc etc to anyone who visits the excellence , please take a stack of dollar bills and reward these folks for their hard work the longer we stayed at the resort , the more we tipped because it was just impossible to ignore the great service and attitude the leader of the pack was jose at the cafe/kafe bar and folks almost seemed to line - up to give this great guy tips the resort is stunningly beautiful and the grounds are immaculate our room ( a first floor pool walk - out ) was nearly perfect and the twice a day service from our maid was excellente we ate in 5 of the 7 restaurants ( ( we did not eat at spice ( oriental ) or agave ( mexican ) ) and we found the food outstanding for an all - inclusive seafood , beef or fowl was always properly prepared and well - presented chez isabelle was our favorite followed closely by barcelona the no reservation policy really suited our style and we never minded the wait for dinner ( they give you a buzzer/beeper ) since that just meant more time at one of the terrific bars ( also favorite haunts of those pesky mosquitoes ) we did think the daily lunch buffet was average ( served in toscana ) but found that if we wanted to spend a little more time and eat in the grill we could get some great food ( their caribbean shrimp is perfecto ) one minor complaint is the lack of a barefoot restaurant where you can have lunch without changing out of a wet swimsuit both lunch venues do have a dress code and at the very least you would need to have a dry suit and decent cover - up they do sometimes come around on the beach with pizza ( its good ) but that is infrequent and cannot be counted - on for lunch they do sometimes have a 12:30 bbq outdoors and this does provide a solution on some days we are beach people and spend much of our time on beaches and swimming in the ocean at excellence , a majority of the guests stay around the pool ( never could understand why you go to the sea to sit at a pool ) and it can be hard to find pool lounge later in the day the pool lounges that are under palapas and the lounges that are actually in the pool seemed to be the first to go every day ( guests will reserve lounges by 8am with towels and other personal effects ) however , it was never a problem to get a palapa and loungers on the 1/2 mile beach since most of the reviews talk about the amazing pool , i will focus on the beach its well manicured ( swept by a tractor - pulled rake every day ) and we always had good drink service on the beach from very friendly staff ( do not forget some dollars to tip these folks ) the ocean was always red flagged ( very dangerous ) during our 10 days and we found swimming to be a challenge for us ( and some other ocean lovers ) it was fun trying to deal with the waves ( they break 4 times in the last 50 yards to the beach ) and the ever - changing currents rip - tides can happen pretty close to shore and we did see one near - drowning where a disaster was averted by several strong swimmer guests ( there are no life guards ) who rescued a 20- something guy who had no clue how to deal with a rip - tide ok , now for the big negative we loved the resort but will never return the mosquitoes are always hungry and , although the resort does spray almost every evening , it does not solve the problem the insects can spawn in the bordering marsh or anywhere in the miles of rice paddies that are located within a mile of the resort there is simply no solution we did make liberal use of off insect repellent (15 % deet ) and i watched mosquitoes feed on that deet one of my feet had more than 25 bites in one evening ( despite being saturated in off ) and that foot is now swollen to the point where its uncomfortable to wear shoes these bugs will also bite through your clothes a senior staff person at excellence told us that when he rides his motorcycle he cannot outroom the little buggers so here 's the bottom line we finally found a near - perfect all - inclusive , but its just impossible to overlook the effect the mosquitoes had on our trip we were told that it is a year - round problem so , if you want to go to a wonderful resort and ignore these little buggers than take your bug repellents ( perhaps 40% deet would be more effective ) and enjoy this wonderful place as to us , we will certainly give excellence more chances , but it will never , ever be in this punta cana location 
i went to excellence for a week with a friend , and although we seemed to be the only two there that were not a couple , it was a beautiful property with wonderful service from all departments and fairly good food the resort is definately designed and aimed at couples with a very romantic atmosphere , but there is a wonderful entertainment staff that make it their priority to make sure you are having a nice time so even if you are not with a couple you will always have someone around to entertain , dance , chat etc with you the staff is all so helpful and will make you feel like family the only crappy thing was that is was really hard to find fresh pool towels at any time of day if i return to punta cana i would definately return to excellence from my experience everything you could want is available , and they make it next to impossible to not have a nice vacation unless you are trying 
very classy resort we stayed at excellence nov 7-15adults only - very classy without being snobby the thing that makes this resort is the staff very friendly , always happy and will do anything to make your stay as nice as possible we made friends with many people during our stay , especially joyce and dave from toronto and the honeymooners , phillip and brooke we arrived at 6:30pm and took a taxi from the airport to the excellence i emailed the hotel prior to our arrival and they sent a taxi for us the driver was waiting for us holding up a sign with our names on it the ride took about 1 hour , but well worth it once we arrived there is also free resort bus service to all the hotels as well , but the excellence is the last stop on the resort run we were promptly greeted at the excellence with a cold towel and asked what kind of cold beverage we wanted our room was a garden view junior suite which was located on the bottom floor we faced the wedding gazebo and the beach beyond we had a little grassed area with a stone walkway the room was kept spotless during our stay our housekeeper , caridad , was so sweet she took care of everything and we had plenty of towels , bottled water etc when we returned to our room in the evening , our bed was turned down and she even put flower petals everywhere we managed to communicate with her despite our language differences this resort is very beautiful , well kept with gardens , birds , turtles you just have to experience it for yourselves the beach has big waves and you can use the boogie boards at no cost be careful in the waves expecially if you wear a bikini we saw a few ladies lose their tops in the surf i locked my good jewellery in the room safe when i went to the beach to play in the waves sand as soft as baby powder , no rocks and no seaweed food - the food was excellent with so many choices breakfast choices were the buffet in the toscana which opens around 7:00am or the lobster house which opens at 10:30 lunch - lots of choices toscana buffet , the grill or if we wanted to stay at the beach , the staff had a barbecue daily with burgers , fries , hotdogs and sometimes ribs and chicken they even deliver pizza to your beach chair dinner - every restaurant we tried was fantastic and the service was always with a smile we loved that we did not have to make reservations for any of the restautants the entertainment staff were fantastic , there is no reason to ever be bored at the excellence we found an activity sheet on our bed every evening , which had the activities for the following day i took spanish lessons with francisco , a very funny guy who also attempted to teach me to salsa during evening dance lessons we experienced some rainy days , but not to worry , they have that covered as well in the huge lobby area where the stage is located , they pulled down a giant screen and showed movies , or they pull around a huge cart with board games they have a show every evening at 10:00 which is very entertaining our favourite memory of excellence punta cana will be the night we followed the candle lit path to the beach and found domingo playing his sax and he was accompanied by raphael on the keyboard we danced on the beach under the stars , very romantic we bought 2 of his cds there are lots of bars located on the property and the staff will make you anything you want to drink they always have a drink of the day and you will see altagarcia walking around delivering the drinks to either the beach or around the pool jesse , pablo , grayson , carlos are some of the other bartenders who will offer you a drink and entertain you at the same time there are many other staff we would like to mention , but i did not write all their names down so to all the staff at the excellence , thank you for a great vacation negatives - only 2mosquitos - yes , when it rains there will be mosquitos bring your bug spray people who took the blue pool floats and stashed them on their pool lounges and did not use them for hours we even noticed some people hide 2 or 3 of the floats under their towles although it was written in the news letter every evening , people still felt it necessary to get to the pool early and hide them for themselves all day we managed to grab on to a couple of floats it 's just nice to experience the ride to the swim up bar on a floaty please feel free to email us if you have any questions about the resort 
relaxing vacation we stayed at the excellence resort in punta cana 11/3 - 11/10 it was very relaxing , except for the frustrations at the pool check - in : smooth bags quickly taken to our room anniversary banner on our door ( thanks ) room : building 14 quiet/clean/leak started from the ceiling and was never fixed by saturday afternoon 2 calls to front desk maintenance came and went without a word no apology when we left food : pretty good lots of choices went to every restaurant breakfast was very good and there will not be a need to go to lunch ( unless it 's raining : ) favorite : breakfast least favorite : lobster house ( bugs and chewy lobster ) grounds : beautiful service : excellent we brought , and gave $150 in tips it did not make any difference in the service provided , but probably mattered to the receipent pool : beautiful please be a courtese guest do not take the floats in the morning it will work for everyone if you do too , please only take one chair per person ( we saw a couple with 4 chairs by the pool shade versus sun rather than just pulling the chairs into the sun , with 2 floats hidden under their towels that is a total of 10 towels on their 4 chairs it was so frustrating to the rest of us recommendation to the resort : print on the floats , please leave the me in the water i 'm for all the guests country : covered with litter bugs : too many to count i had 20 bites on one foot and that was with bug spray on they were absolutely terrible 
excellente for the excellence punta cana we have just returned from our wonderful 6 day stay at the absolutely magnificent excellence hotel in punta cana the luxurious all - adult , all - inclusive hotel is a so beautiful and the service was excellent the staff was incredible - they went overboard in making sure your every need was met we made friends with several of the staff , especially the entertainment instructor named franklin and a very sweet hostess named loren their friendship made our trip even more memorable we hope to keep in touch with them via email the food was fabulous especially the lobster at the lobster house ( we ate their twice ) and the chateubrian and creme brulee at the french resturant , we also liked the asian restaurant - spice the beach setting was so relaxing with music playing , activities to participate in and wonderful bbq 's ( the paella was to die for ) the pool was gigantic in size and had relaxing beds and cabanna 's to relax in the swim up bar was the best of all the 8 bars we could go to ( the coco loco 's and planters punch were so refreshing ) the entertainment was top notch and we especially enjoyed the saxophone player ( domingo ) every night on the plaza we have travelled alot over the years and i would say this was our best vacation with an overall rating of excellent we will certainly be going back in the future 
great resort , , except first let me say we would go back again without hesitation pro 'sbeautiful resort the staff does an excellent job keeping it immaculate pool and beach are outstanding staff , , 9 out of 10 of them are excellent , they are always smiling and greeting you and are always asking if they can help you bartenders are great our room was great except our key card reader was not working properly half the time the mattress was a little tough , but if you have good bartenders you wo not feel a thing the shows were great and the disco was a lot of fun see mario for some shots con 's : the misquitoes were terrible bring long pants for evening fun eat at the inside restaurants while i was at the resort i heard several people say the food was great my experience was not the good i guess my expectations were to high i would have sent back most of my meals if i was eating in the usa the resort is about 35 miles from the airport and takes about an 1 hour plus ride to get there the roads are rough , , , just hang on and relax you will get there eventually despite the negatives we had a great time and were really happy with our choice we hope to go back again 
beautiful beach , pool , rooms food  my husband and i just returned from excellence after a 6 night stay overall , it was a very nice resort and we enjoyed ourselves very much the decor and the rooms were amazing it was by far the fanciest place we 've ever stayed our jaws dropped when we saw our room - it was unbeleivable the pools were gorgeous , and the beach was very nice the sand was very soft and the beach was large and there are no other resorts around to obstruct the great view the surf is rough , which we loved because we boogie boarded every day and had a great time jumping in the waves however , if you want to snorkel it 's kind of impossible the swim - up bar at the main pool was great , and we never had to walk very far to find a tasty beverage we saw three of the evening shows and they were all great : especially the circus and the michael jackson show the entertainers at the resort are amazing dancers the disco was fun and we enjoyed feeding the various animals there ( flamingos , baby chicks , ducks , etc ) we would have liked to see a couple of areas improve if we were to go back or to recommend this to others the biggest area that needed improvement was the food the food was not even mediocre - sometimes it was just downright poor , and one night i got a meal ( at the fanciest french restaurant ) , that was actually indedible of all of the meals we had , i can only say that i had 2 that were satisfactory ( and we are not very picky eaters ) luckily , they serve bread with almost every meal , so we did not go hungry , but i was craving my mothers cooking or a fast food burger after the second day of bad food i do recommend everyone try the duck meals they seemed to get the duck right also , it would have been nice if there were more options for snacking during the day to get food durning the day , you have to get dressed and go sit down in one of the restaurants , which is kind of inconvenient the last area of improvement that we would recommend is the service at the restaurants there was definately a severe language barrier that made ordering things very difficult while , admittedly , we should have known more spanish , there were times when we would order directly off of the menu , even pointing at the name of the food that we wanted , and the server did not understand what we were trying to order we did not understand this since they serve food there and should be familiar with the menu also , at most of the bars we discovered that if you ordered a drink by its name , like a white russian or a cape cod , you would get all sorts of variations of drinks we had to resort to telling them exactly which alcohols we wanted in the drink - for instance , instead of a cape cod , we 'd say vodka and cranberry it worked a lot better that way and we quit getting weird drinks that we had no idea what they were my husband got sick one day and spent the whole day sleeping in a beach chair - we beleive it was food poisoning , not the water but he was over it within 24 hours and it did not put a damper on the vacation also , the mosquitos are pretty bad in the evenings make sure you bring bug spray we used it every night and while my husband only got a few bites , i came home with approximately 40 bug bites - i guess my blood is tasty even through the bug spray overall , we really enjoyed our vacation we went for the beach , the pool and the relaxation , so the food did not ruin anything for us however , if you enjoy eating and want an all - inclusive that is quality at every level ( including the food ) , we 'd recommend that you shop around first and read the reviews for the other resorts before making your decision finally , make sure you check out the national travel website ( travel i believe ) before you go , because it will give you tips on everything you need to be ready for when you go through customs this was very helpful ( we got through customs and had our bags within 15 minutes after arrival ) enjoy your trip 
bring bug spray we just returned from punta cana - we stayed at the excellence resort and this is our 2nd visit to excellence the trip was wonderful , the hotel again is beautiful and i cannot say enough about the staff we travelled in a party of 10 and the only issue was at dining time the restaurants could not handle a party of 10 with the exception of japanese - we had to split up into a table of 6 and a table of 4 this is not how we planned on dining each night the restaurants are very large in size and can handle a table of 10 one other issue - the mesquitos - they were in full force and there was not enough bug spray to have any effect if your going in the near future - pack long pants , socks and plenty of bug spray the bug issue put a damper on the evening 
my wife and i spent our honeymoon here the third week of october the place was very beautiful as many reviews have mentioned i read reviews on this site for the last 8 months before i left so i wanted to make sure to return the favor bus ride - we used gogo travel and they had a nice air - conditioned bus both ways it is a long trip , but as long as you are aware of it being over an hour it really is not that bad rooms - we had an oceanview room on the 2nd floor very nice room we brought candels on the advice of some of the reviews as the rooms are a little musty , and it helped we also left a couple $ 's each day for the housekeeper food - the breakfest and lunches are great the variety of restaurants for the dinner is also great the food on the dinner menu will taste different then you may be expecting also , the appetizers and salads are small servings at most restaurants , so do not feel bad for ordering multiple things i was not too impressed with the room service , but we only had it twice we did tip at every meal they do work hard and it 's good to see the money go to where it is needed beach/pool - the best part of the trip the cleanest i have ever seen , and you never have to fight over spots at either place shows - a really good time , we took part in the perfect couple contest and it was lots of fun atv trip - booked it through our gogo rep lots of fun , only a half day away , and you end the trip at a beautiful beach that is on the carribien side , which is a nice change to the beach at the resort overall we really loved the trip the only negetive i had came with the honeymoon package i suppose i had too high of hopes as i read many reviews but i was let down on this we did not have a honeymoon banner on our door , not that big of deal , but disappointing the champaign breakfest was cold and the most disappointing was our romantic dinner we planned this dinner for the last night and really looked forward to it this dinner was not any different then the rest of the nights maybe it was the place we went to barcelona but we sat at the same seats as we were at the previous night when it was agave and had the same server , nothing was different again , maybe my sights were set too high after reading all the great reviews i want to be honest in my feeback and try and give the people reading these reveiws as much info as possible again let me stress we loved this place and we definately will return 
fairly excellent punta cana this was our second visit to this resort we were at this hotel previously when it was part of the secrets chain (2 years ago ) ** getting there **it takes over an hour to get to the resort , and the road along the way is full of potholes however , it is somewhat improved since our last time there and we did notice a number of infrastructure improvements on the island in general staff **most of the staff were very helpful and went out of their way to give good service a special thank you to matias at the front desk he definitely understands what excellence is all about restaurants **good options - all a la carte this was is best way to go no standing in line to book restaurants one or two restaurants a day were closed most were very good i would skip barcelona however , the service and food were not that great chez isabelle , the lobster house , and agave were our favs the grill did good lunches they have a beach bbq at least once per week ( weather permitting ) some restaurants ( the a/c ones ) , have a dress code , so keep this in mind ** rooms **the rooms are sizable and in fact the hotel upgraded us to a larger suite as we were repeat customers nice toiletries , in room safe and good a/c the beds are a bit hard and my back did not enjoy this tv had a good variety of english channels - showtime , hbo , cnn and sometimes things like tlc , discovery channel depending on satellite availability mini bar had beer and soft drinks and was replenished daily we were in building 5 ** housekeeping **the only thing which we did not enjoy was that housekeeping seemed to be very spotty we found some days they were good , and some days were non - existent we are early birds and therefore asked for our room to be cleaned between 9-12 noon it appears that we deviate from the norm , because the room was never cleaned before noon on any day we repeatedly had to ask for this as we like to take a siesta in the afternoon , and the maid would show up and bang on the door to be let in , nearly always after 2 or 3 pm unfortunately we did not find the do not disturb sign in our basket that someone else mentioned so had no way of telling them not to bother us ** pool **we stayed by the cascade pool we generally found it quieter and more enjoyable however , later in the day it seemed to be taken over by young people who had had too much to drink and thought it was funny to jump from the waterfall into the pool below not smart when the pool below only has 5' of water thank goodness we normally retired for our siesta by then bugs **just one thing for those of you sensitive like me bring your bug spray make sure it is the good stuff with deet you 'll need it right now ( october ) we had a number of days of rain ( and i mean heavy downpours for 20-30 minutes at a time - multiple times a day ) and even though i used a bug spray ( non - deet ) , i now have more than one dozen bites on each leg although after seeing some references to bed bugs , i am wondering if that is what they are - especially since i seem to be coming out even post vacation ** overall **still one of the best resorts in punta cana good food , and location , and good value for your travel dollar great for couples and adults only we did find some of the entertainment a bit repetitive ( they had a saxophone player that played the same stuff night after night in the bar - and some of it was my mother 's era music ) ** tour operator **we went on sunwing they did a pretty good job on the way in , but on the way out , the rep did not seem well informed he did not give us the proper exit forms , which we could have filled out on the bus ride from the hotel to the airport and so we ended up having to fill them out right at the immigration counter also , folks , you are allowed a 1 quart ziploc bag with bottles less than 100 ml in it just like everywhere else , despite what this guy tells you ** in flight ** and people , please pay attention to the flight attendants when we landed at pearson , we were stuck on the runway for a minute as per tower instructions and some people jumped up and started getting their stuff out of bins hello the seat belt sign is still on and we are still on the tarmac not at the jetway please do everyone a favour and pay some attention cell phones in canada are not allowed to be turned on until after you are at the gate and the seat belt sign is turned off please think of airport communications and give the pilot and attendants a break the rules are there for a reason ** overall **a good experience probably enjoyed the first time more , but that 's usual with the novelty of any given situation still a wonderful place to chill out for a week in the sun 
we loved this resort my partner and i spent our honeymoon at the excellence punta the second week in october and absolutely had a wonderful time as a gay couple on our honeymoon naturally we were a bit unsure of peoples reactions we were treated like royalty my partner and i have 16 and 20 years experience in hospitality and between us we have ran spas , inns , restaurants and i am a certified chef the one detail that stands out in our minds is the personal and proffesional service we received from the warm and happy staff special thanks to rey , waldy , the executive chef bert and martinez who made us kick - ass omeletes every morning and all the wonderful staff at the excellence club here is our breakdown : transportation : we read many reviews before we left that recommended we not take the bus as the trip to the resort was very rough we booked a limo from the airport to the resort which was a huge waste of money for $175 00 our limo was dirty , hot ( horrible if no airconditioning ) , warm bottled water and i got hit in the head by the airconditioner vent which fell from the roof , although the driver was very friendly we decided to take a cab back to the airport it was airconditioned , spotless and the driver was very friendly food : it was awesome not to have to make reservations each evening the food was diverse , fresh and you could have barbeque for lunch or dress up the had take out and delivered pizzas to the beach and rooms and all the restaurants were excellente i particularily recommend the lobster house the only thing to note is that the mosquitos are quite aggressive , bring but repelent with deet and use it every evening the days seem to be just fine with out but repellent activities/entertainment : the days were filled with endless activities which are posted in the lobby with alternates for rain days we loved receiving our daily news letter the evening before so that we could make choices of what to do the day before the evening entertainment was fantastic , they put a lot of effort into costumes and set design and the open air theatre is wonderful , this talented troupe performed in almost every show which changed every evening go horseback riding it is included and wonderful , there is a market on the way back just next to the resort which is much more affordable than the gift shops in the hotel they also had tons more product the pool was amazing and large , it spanned across the whole resort we found an alternate two tier pool next to the night club that was quiet and wonderful the bar served light snacks during the day they have beach beds on both the beach and by the pools , they serve you drinks at both water spots as well bars : have the drink of the day it is always awesome but the coco loco 's are out of this world the champagne and house wine were quite good and they provide both high end alcohol and bar rail brands along with domestic beer we are extremely well travelled and this was one of the cleaniest beaches and most beautiful in all of our travels , they will provide you with boogie boards and a guide ( franklin - totally knowledgable and sooo friendly ) the waves can be a bit rough but the water was always like a warm and welcoming bath service : i cannot say enough about the service , the fact that people remembered our names right off the bat was amazing we stayed in the excellence club that had a few added features but i must say that everyone at our resort no matter where they were staying felt like royalty this hotel has outdone themselves in staff spirit , all the employees smile and sing as they work spa services : as avid spa goers i have to tell you this is an absolutely breathtaking and spotless facility the diverse services were performed perfectly by the welcoming staff we should all be so lucky 
disappointed we took this trip for our 20th anniversary in october , 2007, without our boys we had a gardenview junior room ( requested oceanview ) and ended up in a room that looked out at the back window of chez isabel not much water to be seen from here the garden was not what we expected management tried to accommodate our request but the only room that would have done this was a honeymoon suite - - for an additional $2,100 this included a hot tub on the balcony , which you would not have been able to use after 6:00 p because of the mosquitos the first two days here , we had no face cloths - - makes it kind of hard to wash off the suntan lotion we had to hide the wash cloth we finally got on the balcony so it did not disappear with maid service we did get clean towels again in the late afternoon/early evening on tuesday we booked our anniversary dinner through the concierge and had our reservation confirmation ticket we arrived at the restaurant ( spice ) and we were not on their list after two days of warmish soda and water in the fridge in our room , we asked management for a replacement because things were not cold and were told that they are not fridges , they are coolers warm beverages in 90 degree weather was not what we were looking for as far as the alcoholic drinks we had , there was little to no alcohol in our drinks we even saw the bartender at the martini bar adding water to some of the bottles , you could not go outside without getting eaten alive by the mosquitos we tried to eat at the grill for dinner and had ordered , but had to leave because we were being swarmed and bitten we tried again the next day for lunch , and asked that the tartar sauce not be put on the fish sandwich my husband actually saw the chef take the food off the counter , wipe the tartar sauce off with paper towels and place it back up for service when it came to us , we just left the entertainment staff , rey , francisco , inez , altagracia , etc they add some fun to the day without them , it would be pretty boring they went out of their way to try to include you in things that were going on they had pet names for some guests the shows we attended were decent as far as food service went , a meal took at least 1 to 1 1/2 hours to get through even when there were only 10-15 couples in the restaurant the food was pretty good - we tried some new foods at the restaurants we ate at during the middle of our first night , our phone rang in the room one time it continued to do this throughout the night at various times the entire week we were there we were told the problem would be fixed by wednesday , but it kept happening through saturday when we left not bad , being woken up at 5 a on your vacation we finally took the phone off the hook - hoping our kids did not need to reach us the bed was very uncomfortable - just like sleeping on the floor the shower was very small (3 x 3 maybe ) and dark we were very disappointed for a 5 1/2 star resort we will not return nor recommend this resort to anyone there are much nicer places out there 
wishing we could 've taken our honeymoon memories back with us i am going to write my review in two sections the good and the bad first the good/great - *when we arrived at the resort , we were met with a cool towel and a drink after the very long bus - ride and stepping out into the heat , the towel was a very nice touch our first impressions were that the grounds were spotless , and the lobby area was beautiful the staff was very friendly and attentive to our arrival and someone had immediately taken our bags for us and waited for us to check in *our room was beautiful and clean the jacuzzi was great and we used it a few times the balcony was nice , but did have an ant problem we were also a little bummed that our door did not have a screen *the food was not excellent , but it was good our favorite restaurants were agave and the lobster house the fajitas were excellent coupled with the presidente beer you can get bud light if you request it bars were all pretty standard we hung out at the pool bar just about everyday it was one of the only bars that had tonic that actually tasted like tonic david and pedro were our favorite bartenders although we came fully prepared to tip our favorite bartenders to receive specialized service , it did not really matter we 'd tip $5- $10 for our first round expecting our cup to never empty , but on many occasions we 'd tip and the bartender would leave for extended periods of time we quickly learned that tipping yielded no attention and to only tip when a drink was good , or when the bartender was specifically being attentive to us do not tip up front pool was very clean and had the perfect balance of chemicals some pools are over - chlorinated , or vice - versa we found the pool to have a great balance so that we did not smell like chlorine all day , or feel like our eyes were burning it was very pleasant be sure to get to the pool fairly early to secure a float and a towel they can be hard to come by later in the afternoons *porn 24/7 on channel 21 to set the mood - ) *the free horseback riding tour was fun , for 30 minutes we wished it were a little longer , but it was a nice trip to the end of the beach and back now the bad - ****all - in - all we had a great time , but our last day was a total nightmare we were leaving saturday october 6th , 2007 it was pouring rain and everyone was congregating in the lobby as people were waiting for their transport to the airport we placed our bags on one of the tables in the lobby as we were waiting for our transportation van to the airport at this time , we were approached by the entertainment staff to do a short activity before our van arrived we left our things on the table and walked 20 feet to the stage where the activity commenced upon time for our van to leave , we went to pick up our things and noticed our camera was missing we turned every chair upside down , had the staff looking , and even made an announcement via the dj booth one guest approached us and said she saw a cocktail waitress pick it up and put it on her tray we asked every service person if they had seen a camera , and all of the sudden nobody knew any english both my wife and i broke down and were heartbroken that we lost our weeks worth of our only honeymoon pictures resort was wonderful and anybody traveling to punta cana wo not have any issues staying here i ca not imagine there being a better resort on the island , however do not leave your things unattended even if the entertainment staff pulls you by your arms/legs *we will always have a nauseous feeling in our stomach about this place , but only because we do not have our honeymoon pictures that we spent so much time and effort to take the waitress could have at least left the memory card : - ( 
hola excellence my hubby and i stayed at the excellence resort in punta cana after reading many reviews about this resort , we were convinced to visit getting to the actual hotel was a trip in itself it took over an hour to get there booking transportation from airport to hotel and back is a must once there our experience was fantastic the resort is very beautiful and extremely manicured we were treated like a king and queen i was so spoiled and pampered , which for me was a pleasant and an unexpected surprise it was great to relax and meet so many fabulous people from all over the world most important , the people that worked there , were the best they took excellent care of us and always with a smile we fell short of nothing and everything at our fingertips the food was good not great as many noted in there reviews the shows were very entertaining and upbeat the bartenders kept us laughing all the time cafe cafe had jose and his crew keeping everyone happy with his coco locos : ) and sol bar with juan , luis , isaac and the girls were fantastic as well all the workers kept you busy , laughing and happy all in all it was a beautiful experience and would definitely go back for more 
relaxing vacation resort my husband and i returned from our trip to excellence on september 4th we were there four nights and were overall very pleased with everything our biggest complaint was the food , but you can read more about that below this is a great resort if you just want to relax and enjoy the amenities , which is exactly what we did it?? not five star for those of you who think of four seasons and the waldorf when you think of five star , but it?? pretty good for an all inclusive transportation : ride to and from the airport was as expected it takes an hour each way and they drive a little crazy , but overall not bad check in : smooth , quick no one even asked us about upgrading or joining the excellence club , which was fine with us from what i read , it 's a waste of $ room : we were in building 11 our room was in good condition we had no complaints other than a dog barking every morning at around 4:30am there?? a residential community that is adjacent to the resort property , and evidently someone has a dog over there the resort was willing to move us to another room in building 4 ( way on the other side ) but we declined because we didn?? want to deal with packing everything up again they offered no other incentive for the annoyance room service and maid service were always quick no complaints there the room layout was nice , but the shower was a bit small and squeezing two people in it was out of the question this was our favorite part there are so many options for lounging there are cabana beds both on the beach and at the pool , as well as tiki huts throughout you never had to ??eserve? spot because there was always something open and clean towels everywhere for you to grab the same goes for the pool floats bar service was excellent and the staff was constantly coming around bringing drinks/snacks to us the beach area had plenty of amenities including boogie boards , ocean kayaks , snorkel equipment , etc the only downside of the beach is that it?? very ??tlantic? in nature because it?? on the atlantic side of the island therefore , we had brown sand and big waves , not white sand and crystal clear calm waters the breeze from it was really nice because it was quite hot , but it would have been nice to feel more ??aribbean? food : we??e not huge eaters , but we were really disappointed with the food the only thing five star about the food was chez isabelle , the french restaurant the others were all par for the course every night something we ordered on the menu was out of stock which was both disappointing and annoying they also randomly close a restaurant or two every night they alert you ahead of time , but it 's still a let down if you were really looking forward to a type of cuisine that day breakfast and lunch are in the same two restaurants every day with the same menus every day? the ambiance is something the resort could improve on , as many of the restaurants were not very romantic at night due to the lights being turned up way too high for a ??omantic? overall the food was not bad , but it was not that great either drinks : the drinks were great you do have to ask for the top shelf alcohol if you want it , but it?? freely flowing and available at all the bars we never felt the need to tip anyone , nor did we experience inferior service from someone as a result this was a bonus the only complaint we have about the drinks are the ??re processed? frozen drinks like a strawberry daiquiri , for example it comes out of a big machine and was made with strawberry flavored syrup ? very low quality we did find a real margarita one night at agave ( mexican restaurant ) which was a pleasant surprise during the day , however , at the bars you have to settle for the pre - mixed , sub par frozen concoctions all the other drinks are fantabulous , however shopping : the vendors at the edges of the beach are very aggressive if you??e firm with them , they??l leave you alone one night the resort hosted many vendors on the property it was fun to look their products , but again they??e very aggressive trying to get you over to their booth instead of the guy?? booth next to them ( it?? like a swarm of bees fighting over the only honey pot you must bargain with them i wanted a turquoise necklace , bracelet , and earring set the guy wanted to know how much i would pay for all three i turned the question around and asked him what he wanted he said ? i laughed out loud and offered $25 i stood my ground and 60 seconds later walked away with my new jewelry for $25 amenities : you must take advantage of two things at this resort : 1) the photography session ? we signed up for a 30 minute photo shoot on the beach for a mere $60 the very nice french photographer took about 60 images total he printed them all out and we got to choose ten 5x7?? to keep we went ahead and paid another $40 to get a disc of all the photos so we could take them home and print them ourselves $100 for a photo session with the right to copy? good deal ( trust me , i?? a professional photographer sign up for this at the amenities desk 2) the horseback riding on the beach : you sign up for this at the concierge desk they ride five days a week at 10am or 4pm it was so much fun the staff was great and they even took pictures of us with my camera they also took pictures of us with their camera , then when we were done tried to sell us a bottle of rum with our picture already on the label ( pretty cool ) for $15, but we passed since we had our own pictures on our camera total ride was about 30 minutes long we really enjoyed it 
objective review we went to excellence to scout it as a possible contender for our wedding next february i think with any review it 's important to understand the traveler because people have different expectations and what might be right for me may not be right for you and vice - a - versa my fianc? and myself are 28 and 34 respectively we spend a ridiculous amount of money per year traveling , entertaining , and dining our tastes are relaxed yet upscale with a heavy emphasis on service we both come from families of modest means , which i think tends to add sensibility to our perceptions we are not the typical american travelers that you see standing at the lobby of every hotel in the world complaining that the tvin their room doesn?? get the nascar channel or there?? no bud lite in the fridge , or just wondering why no speaks english in addition , i worked for marriott in their corporate offices for six years and had the chance to learn the hotel industry from the inside our impression of excellence was that it is like a once beautiful woman whose beauty has faded but whom still makes the effort everyday to look her best for now , that behavior is commendable but in a few years it will be embarrassing the things this property has going for it are it?? service , which is quite good it?? size ( we prefer small  intimate to large , sprawling complexes ) and the wonderfully complete lack of children ( i?? sure your children are darling but the only thing worse than the guy trying to wear jean shorts to dinner are the parents that sit obliviously by as their children make the most devout christians reevaluate their opinion of roe v the main areas of improvement are the food and the very tired and weary nature of the guestrooms and the unfortunately pastel buildings that encompassed these guestrooms the dining experiences were , by far , the most disappointing part of our stay breakfast was good , lunch was adequate , and dinner was poor to top it off , as someone previously mentioned , it was quite painful to dress for dinner and eat sans a/c watching the sweat drip off of my fellow diners did little to relieve the mortification i felt as sweat dripped off me that?? not an exaggeration if you?? like to duplicate this experience at home , turn up your thermostat to 88 degrees , turn on your shower until your bathroom is full of steam , throw on a pair of worsted wool pants , and enjoy an overcooked piece of meat that claims to be chateaubriand as an alternate , grill several types of meat and then pour canned mushroom gravy over the entire thing never fear though , your server will always serve you from the right and accommodate you to the best of his ability it?? not quite white - glove service but it?? far superior to most you??l encounter in the caribbean i think the disparity between the wonderful staff and the aging nature of the facility actually made the flaws stand out even more to sum it up , we thought it was an ok place to spend a weekend but not to have our wedding and it?? much closer to a 3- star than a 4- star we noticed the property used to be a secrets property but doesn?? seem to be affiliated with them anymore perhaps they were deflagged it seems like that?? very possible to me and does not bode well for their future 
beware of casino , be assertive in health care crisis learn spanish avoid casino and save that for ac , vegas , or foxwoods the grounds for the excellence were quite nice very niceas borat would say unfortunately , his very attractive minister of health was not on the beach with us the beach and pools , esp the beach were spectacular and for us , the defining part of the trip service was hideous because of language barriers if you are a vegetarian , you may order 2-3 times until they understand you mean no meat or sea food the buffets uninspiringshows were campy food horrible except for chez isabelle so get used to that french restaurant and its marvelous fish get used to the phrase excellence used by the staff nearly as much as ola is used by their two parrots which great guests as the enter the compound or at least as often as the south park character says timmy avoid casino like the bubonic plague absolutely , i do not mind losing money and i did so legitimately but some of the losses were because of less than legitimate or honest behavior i do not mind if there is something on regulated , and less dependent than ac , vegas or foxwoods , but on 3 separate occasions dealer 's , with very limited english seemed to purposefully misunderstood my directions both in english and in hand signals the money lost was negligible compared to other losses but it rather ticked me off the worst experience is that i had an off duty dealer , who was chirping in me ear and hover over me , while cards were being dealt he kept on encouraging me to hit , hit hit the supervisor did not chide the off duty dealer i asserted myself and directly him clearly that i wanted him on the other end of the room one dealer dealt me cards , when i was the only person on the table , i had told him to wait , both in english and by hand signal , i was turned around fully to count my chips and make a decision whether to continue he dealt me anyway i could not even see whether he dealt me legitimately the supervisor did not intervene nor did she discipline one my first day , another dealer , i instructed no more cards , and motioned with my hands to stop , nonetheless , she dealt her english was worse than the parrots or her instructions were to bilk customers my wife thought that the workers were just stupid or was just stupefied by their behavior i think it is the english and the casino generally attitude save the gambling to a legitimate place in the states or a more legitimate resort i do not think behavior like that should be rewarded boycott that casino until people speak the kings english , act ethically , and do not booze people until till their eyes are blood shot i do not drink all that much but they did ply the gambler with a ferocity not seen elsewhere in the resort many more of the seasoned gamblers echoed the sentiment of the unregulated nature and suspicions of how things were run i can speak to my personal experience where i felt incompetent persons were manning the table or looking to pull a fast one the disorganized dealing out of the cards out of order , not fully flipping et all would seem to bear that out of health , emergencies and pull out armoires : my wife gashed her finger on the pull out portion of the armoire so watch out there was minimal help there was no follow up clearly there was something wrong with the pull out mechanism she need more than just a regular band aid , some strong gauze , an anti biotic and maybe some stitches she was bleeding quite heavily at the time she needed ice but the bartender did not understand she did have as doctor look at it but he gave her a regular band - aid we continued to apply pressure and ice there was clearly a gash this will be re looked at in nyc there was no follow up or concern by the hotel the hotel needs to take more responsibility for injuries when the may emanate from or the facilities are the proximate cause of the injury maybe a better hotel would have been more solicitious why you should consider going beach great but rough surf and no life - guards it was warning flags all the time had a problem only once wave riding it was a little scary i am/was a fairly strong swimmer food bad , except the french restaraunt , service bad but tries country not that beautiful no grand historic sites worth seeing if you like pool , swimming , beach sunset , why not i hope management reads this as i left a number and there was never any follow up that is a scenario i would have prefer they tended to obfuscate who was in charge in order to avoid responsibility i was going to take them to small claims over the finger and the small amount of gambling[mostly the finger] but it was not worth the time i an otherwise employer as a lawyer i figured out a way of establishing minimal contacts which was cooloddly enough , i still had to say i had a good bang for the buck enjoyed the beach enjoy the pool , enjoy the facilities , the sunsets[though sometimes hazy and enjoy your loved one bring band aids , stronger brand , and gauze , triple anti bacteria and solarcaine for burns , lots of lotion[expensive , misquito repellent , a dollop of assertiveness , and some dvds so you can escape that g - d awful casino and the campy shows and you should be fine oh , some scented bath oils , bath sea salts , scented candles might be nice for the jacuzzi if permittedwith a little more effort , this resort can be better ranging from better english , better food , a little ants nr the porch[ as we had and another couple next door complained and we observed about them near their jacuzzi] if you want better then it may be w orth spending more on a better all inclusive or on a better which is not an all inclusive after all this moaning , have a coco loco , lock into a good price , get travel insurance , swim carefully[the surf at cancun is usually calmer] , enjoy sunsets , avoid hurricane season , and splurge and get a direct flight and you will have a decent time beware of the pull out armoire the pull out mechanism is not that safe and you wo not find the soup nazi 's soup recipes from seinfeld there anyway lastly , be ready , for a clientele , that is not the most , how shall i say it , refined or college educated from good school , or people with refined tastes in the arts , or theater or movies we meet one nice couple from dc one nice couple from my alma mater but just be aware 
great time , fun and relaxing my wife and i traveled to excellence punta cana from 8/15 - 8/22 we had a wonderful time i will attempt to break this trip report down in several sections : transport to/from airport : excellence is about one hour from the airport the shuttle has a/c and the drivers try to get you there as soon as possible yes , the roads are bumpy my advice - enjoy the countryside and see how the other half lives the resort : it is very nicely done the lobby is top of the line and immaculate we had a junior suite with a garden view the room was plenty big and the a/c worked a minor compliant was the shower - on the small side and the mini - refrig did not keep the beverages to cold we had a king sized bed , jacuzzi , tv , and mini - refrigerator that was stocked with beer , pop and juice upon arrival there was a complimentary bottle of rum all in all the room was appropriate for our needs the beach : the beach is beautiful nice soft sand and plenty of shady areas this is the best beach we have been on we have stayed in cancun , ocho rios , mayan riveria , virginia beach and mytrle beach and other resorts in punta cana the water is warm and in some spots blue as stated in previous reviews the waves are stronger than one might think with that said the waves did not bother me i enjoyed them as i wave busted honestly though the waves are not that big of a deal no different than the waves at virgnina or mrytle beaches on most days the waiter staff took drink orders or brought the drink of the day right to you on the beach additionally , wait staff would bring food on to the beach in case you did not want to leave the beach and go to the restaurant do not be upset if the wait staff does not come to you you eat and drink plenty so use this as an opportunity to walk to the nearest bar and get a drink and burn up some calories there are seven restaurants to choose from - spice , spanish , french , mexican , italian , the grill and the lobster house our favorite was the lobster house we went there twice and had grilled lobster what a good meal plenty of good food at the mexican restaurant next came the grill , italian and spice restaurants we did not care for the spanish restaurant and the french restaurant did not have anything to our tastes i did hear plenty of good things though about the french restaurant for breakfast and lunch you can go to the buffet which is located at the italian restaurant - toscana the food was good they serve tradidition breakfast and lunch foods along with left overs from the previous night all in all the food was very good no complaints and we did not get sick entertainment staff : they all work very hard to get people involved if they so desire francisico and franklin stood out but they all did a wonderful job we had the pleasure of staying at excellence when rain storms from hurricane dean went through the entertainment staff got out board games in the lobby for people to play and participate in the nightly entertainment was good as stated in previous posts the michael jackson show was good they had a 70's and 80's show , a magic show , a dominican show , etc you are on vacation so sit back and enjoy jose , kenny and greison are wonderful bartenders they do a great job of making drinks and making you feel like you are important we did leave tips for the maids , bartenders , waiters thye greatly appreicated it they work 11 consecutive days and then have three days off there are stores off the property ( off to the left ) with decent prices you can walk on the beach about 1/4 of a mile to the left of the resort you will find a slice of heaven perfect water and caribbean perfection go and have a good time you will enjoy the vacation if you relax the pools are nice but we are beach people the people are friendly 
not all that excellente we stayed at the resort from 25th july for two weeks having stayed last year at the sister resort secrets excellence riviera cancun in mexico we had alot to compare it too the mexican resort was truly 5 star and we highly recommend that you stay there if you enjoyed excellence punta cana we did not think that excellence punta cana was 5 star by any stretch of the imagination prehaps 3/4 star and that 4 star is pushing it we have been fortunate to stay in 5 star hotels in the caribbean before including sandals but we are no means snobs we just want good value for money , because it is expensive if you are travelling from the uk now do not get me wrong the beach and setting of the hotel is beautiful but as i said as returning excellence members we would rather have spent the same money and stayed at excellence riviera cancun in mexico do not bother upgrading to the excellence club spend the money on flight upgrades instead we met a lovely couple glenn and kim whilst there and we compared rooms glenn and kim had upgraded to excellence club and they only recived a paper , free internet and liquors in there room we both had exactly the same room ( although we had cockroaches ) so the ?300 extra spent we all thought was a waste of money the food was lovely at the hotel and there was lots of choice as previous members have written it is a good idea if you brush up on your spanish beforehand as it is difficult to divulge in conversation in restaurants the room service is also very good however it usually took up to an hour during the day to come maid service was very good however rooms were not serviced until late in the afternoon and they start cleaning early and are very noisy we would say that 80% of the staff were fantastic and gave us brilliant service but the other 20% were very poor and this poor service/attitude tainted the good service we recieved the beach was beautiful , the sea was nice and warm and choppy - but this was good fun to play in if you are like us and want somewhere nice and peaceful to chill in the days then the bottom end of the pool is great good areas to shade and relax good access to floaties and nice bar with lovely service called 'sol ' try a banannamamma wow pure heaven unfortunatley there was lots of flies and insects in the pool which we think it was down to a lot of people smoking cigars and eating fast food in the pool and we never saw the same people leave the pool for toilet visits - need i say anymore the swim up bar area was the same we did not dare venture down that way as i did not pack enough anticeptic wipes we are not snobs by any means but we have been fortunate enough to stay at quite a few 5 star all inclusuive resorts in the carribbean and unfortunately this one is no where near the top of the list however all in all we as an okay stay but wont be returning to the hotel or to the island again 
some good , some bad we booked the trip from cheapcarribean com which seemed to be a let down from the start i was told how incredible this place was , then signed up for what i thought was the excellence club , in order to enjoy the other ammenities it turns out that i was not enrolled in the service and when i asked why i have not been upgraded to some of the upgraded services - - such as premium alcohol - - the cheapcarribean customer service rep told me well you are in a third world country ya know , you 're not going to get any good alcohol 'premium ' just means that you 're getting their premium alcohol well i 'm glad i found that out now the other thing that rubbed us the wrong way is that while we found the service at the bars and at other areas outside the restaurants really top - notch , the service inside the restaurants was completely sub - par they huffed and puffed at us when we did not upgrade our wine from the wine list , rarely said thank you and had zero personality while carrying our luggage to our room upon arriving , the bellhop with the glasses told me that the elevator was broken as he left the luggage cart at the bottom of the stairway i said i was sorry that it was broken and continued up the stairs he looked at me , huffed and grabbed the bags and brought them to my room again , no personality or well wishes from him because he must have been upset that i was making him do his job when leaving , the bellhop named carlos was extremely polite and generous he offered to take our picture and asked me why i was wheeling my bags from my room on vacation the last thing that bothered us , before i get to the good , dealt with the jacuzzi our jacuzzi was broken , spewing out brown water for two days they fixed it one night and then tried again before i requested a new room i got a new room and the front desk all made it seem like they were doing me a favor in giving me a room with everything working i asked if they could make it up to my girlfriend and i , since we waited for 4 hours for the situation to be taken care of , and they told me they 'd make it up to me i have to say that i had no problem with the language barrier not for nothing , but if you 're going to their country , try to speak a little spanish they appreciate it and it 's just more fun keep in mind , when folks from other countries come to our country , many people get upset when they do not try to learn our language , so at least make an attempt past all of the previously written negative experiences , some of the resorts all - star staff members were : julio - the activity planner - this guy was top notch fun , likeable , enjoyable to be around the guy glares with charisma he made everyone there feel like they were special and made sure we had a great time cheers to you julio isabella - the activity planner - this is the female version of an all - star activity planner she remembered our names and always came around to talk and make us feel like she really cared about making sure we had fun benjamin - the bartender - one conversation with this guy and you liked him he always remembered what we were drinking , where we were from , and always asked if we 'd be over to see him at the bar a great guy he is geison - pool service - always had a smile , always knew what we were drinking and always joked around with us and because of him , we had a great time at the pool , every time he worked nelson - the bartender - another really fun guy to talk to i 'm horrible at spanish but he helped out as i practiced speaking to him in spanish always had a smile on his face and always quick to help out a great conversation always followed 
ron , judith/hull , england my wife and i stayed from 24th july until 7th august , when we arrived we were greeted with a glass of champagne , which was great , we booked in and where taken to our room , the mini bar in the room was fully stocked and the room was clean and tidy , good start the first morning we had breakfast and headed for the beach , the sea was blue and the sun hot , plenty of sun beds and shade if required what a start the restaurants we visited the first week were very good and we got to talk to the head chef and he gave us some recommendations on what to try , he was spot on the 2nd week the head chef was on vacation and what a differance we booked a romantic meal in the lobster house as it was our 28th wedding anniversary , turned up dressed for the occation only to be told they knew nothing about it and told to go to the bar , we had booked this meal well in advance and had a ticket to prove it , the girl who greets you on arrival and the same girl who told us to go to the bar tried to get the booking slip from us and when i refused to hand it over was very indignant with us , the next morning we were offered in compensation spa treatments at a reduced rate but when we tried to get them , they said they knew nothing about the offer so we gave up , but we did get a bottle of champagne and a bottle of wine in the room , both of which you could get from the bar at any time of the day as i have already said the room was clean and tidy but some days the maid did , nt turn up until 5 o clock in the afternoon , now this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel , well my wife and i have stayed in some of the best 5 star hotels around the world , this is not one of them , dont get me wrong , the staff are great and the entertainment was good , but this hotel is trading on the reputation of the previous owners , secrets exellence , and i , m sorry to say this but 5 star it is not , other guests we met had similar experences big shout to kenny , josey and amerilys at the cafe bar near to the beach , they were excellente and kept us well serviced with a drink and kept everyone entertained at all times of the day we made some good friends whilst we were their , kev and claudia , mike and kathy , we had a ball especially on our fishing trip , sorry you did , nt hook the marlin kev , but hey next time mate all in all a good holiday , but as far as a 5 star hotel , i 'm afraid not go on the mega truck to see the island with munchie absulutely fantastic dress code - we had a meal next to a couple in the french restaurant , him in a open shirt and the female in very short hot pants and a revealing top , and as for manners they were none existent , we felt sorry for the poor waiter who had the misfortunate of serving them , they say ignorance is bliss , be very very wary of the casino , you have been warned , i will leave it at that 
honeymoon upset it is worth noting that this review is being written approximately a year and a half post visit , so things may have changes , but if not , at least we may be able to give you some guidance on what to consider when booking my husband and i chose this resort for our honeymoon destination we flew from ireland to france and then direct from france to punta cana ? needless to say ?? long haul? we arrived at the hotel at approximately 10 30pm local time and , although completely wrecked , were immediately refreshed by the surge of exhilaration when we saw the resort and were greeted with a cocktail and cookies????nfortunately , for us and the other couple who arrived with us , it went downhill ( somewhat ) from this point when we went to check in , we were advised that the hotel was fully booked and as such they were going to have to move us to their sister hotel ( sunscape ) we tried to argue our case advising that it had been pre - booked since august etc etc ? but to no avail the receptionist advised that we were getting a ??eal? their sister hotel was far superior to the excellence? story which we gullibly swallowed as we were so tired , we capitulated and proceeded on our bus journey to our ??pgraded? ( together with the other unimpressed couple in the same boat ) look , i could write a book on our experience here , but needless to say it was not as advised the suite we were given was far from what we considered acceptable given the amount that we had paid and considering the occasion we contended with broken furniture , scum on the tiles in the bathroom , cracked fittings? after 5 days of bitter fighting , upset and many calls back to our travel agent in ireland , we were eventually transferred with an upgrade i can say that we thoroughly enjoyed our experience with the excellence ( especially on the gold package as we had access to the gold lounge , complimentary premier drinks including champagne , your own buffet , internet access etc ) the food was good ( not great , but good ) and the variety was also appreciated the pool area was amazing as it extends quite a distance around the resort and you can stop off at the pool bar for refreshments however , i have to say that our overall experience was marred by our previous five days which we as much as lost due to the upset 5 days off one of the most significant holidays of your life is considerable given this ? would we return ? maybe , but no one , and i mean no one would move us from that check in desk again after our trip i have heard that this can be a regular event with this hotel apparently , as the sister premises is not as popular , they over book with the excellence and off load the surplus to sunscape , so be aware , refuse to move other things to consider is the isolation of the resort it is miles from anywhere , so going on any excursions etc is a big deal 
wined and dined to the max my husband and i stayed at excellence , punta cana from july 23rd to july 28th for our honeymoon a few months beforehand we stumbled across tripadvisor and frequently read reviews which we found to be very helpful in preparation for the trip i 'll touch on a few basics that i think maybe helpful to you arrival to the dominican republic : before going through customs , you must pay an entry fee of $10 00 per person we knew this because of reading the reviews beforehand , but you could tell there were many people at the airport who were unaware of this and thought they were being scammed once you give them the entry fee , in american dollars , you 'll be handed a ticket that you give to the customs agent drive to resort : yes , it 's a bumpy ride and do not plan on those bumps lulling you to sleep it 's not awful though , and will depend on the type of vehicle that you have transporting you we had a mini - bus on the way there , and it made for a bumpy ride however , on the trip back we had a larger bus which was much more smooth drinks : the printed drink menu that is available is not that extensive and you could get bored quickly with it that does not mean , however , that there are not other options below you 'll find a list of some drinks that i tried while i was there that i recommend you try also if you are one that likes fruity , blended drinks write um ' down and take the list with you guarenteed you 'll find it helpful mama , coco loco , dirty banana , sammy sosa , naked monkeyand i 'm saving the best for last while you are there , you must seek out a bar - tender named kenny he works the day shift at the cafe kafe bar and is phenonemal he makes a drink called the kenny special which has ice cream , orange juice , half a banana , mango , malibu coconut rum , and a few other things i 'm still dreaming of the drink you ca not get it anywhere else because they do not have the ice cream machines elsewhere tastes a little different each time , but always excellent food : it would not be fair to listen to my opinion on the food because i 'm not a meat lover and know i 'm in the minority if you love seafood , you 'll be in heaven there because it 's all over the place i lived off of pizza and nachos while i was there , but i guess with all the kenny special 's that i was having i did not need much more appetizers are very small in america , i could make an appetizer be my sole meal but at the resort they were bite size portions i made the mistake one time of ordering an appetizer for my meal and now understand why the waiter looked at me so funny and could not understand that i did not want an entree we never had to wait to be seated at a restaurant we were always escorted right in , of course , myself first and then my husband room service : this was one of my favorite things of the resort and we definetly took advantage of it on average , it took about 30 minutes for our food to be delivered it was strange , though , that the nachos were different each time they ordered them and if you are able to order the tortilla soup , it may be a small miracle because each time i tried they were only serving vegetable soup activities : try to do as many as you can , without burning yourself out everything is free boogie boarding was one of our favorite activities the atlantic ocean is rough , and if you want to complain about that , go to the pool the huge waves made for a fabulous time boogie boarding and we chose to do it more than once because it was such a rush staff : truly good - natured and friendly people they were always quick to greet you with an hola and huge smile do not think you 'll find friendlier people elsewhere tipping : i never once felt obligated to tip and do not think that tipping got us better service than the times that we did not tip while i 'm sure the staff certainly appreciated it , i never felt that they were tip hungry 
best all inclusive excellence punta cana 7-4-07 ? 7-8-07reviewer background : 36, married , no kids , from north jersey/manhattan used to nyc nightlife , dining , and seeks that level of service when traveling , loves luxury service , great food , have been to the palms turks  caicos , fiesta americana grand los cabos and coral beach cancun , fiesta americana grand aqua cancun ( now closed ) , hotel floris ??uracao , w hotels ??nterested in good value for the dollar and finding great deals visited excellence punta cana with two other couples and one we met at the resort who we adopted into our group overall review : best all inclusive i have ever been to i tend to fear all inclusives thinking the food and service is sub par the staff is friendly , the food is good ( not great , blow me off my chair ) but you??l have a few enjoyable meals keep reading for what i hope will be helpful details mosquitos : not terrible but ladies go easy on the perfume , opt for some bug off and you??l be fine??ini montezumas : ? water is purified on the resort but it is common to have your system thrown out of whack while there by day two i had stomach cramps i wasn?? bedridden but the husband had to go to the medic to get some pills a tip : play it safe and get some meds from your doctor that fight stomach bugs and take them before bed during the trip the room : the d?cor is impressive , granite everywhere , d?cor that makes you feel like you are away but not at all tacky far better than the fiesta americana grand coral beach in cancun for much less money and this is an all inclusive the bed is comfy ( not the heavenly bed that you??l get at a starwood property but comfy none the less ) i only saw one bug in the room the whole time we were there jacuzzi is clean and nice for a post pool soak , lovely bathroom , plush fluffy robe and slippers ( heaven ) , and good amount of counter space we never had a shortage of towels and the room was always cleaned on time mini fridge is stocked and everything is included so enjoy note channel 21 is a porn channel ? clearly this is a place for couples / adults if you are looking for an adult only vacation spot this is the place what?? bad : there are power outages but each room had their own fuse box don?? think you can run the blow drier with all the lights on and the tv ? you??l blow a fuse make sure you use the bottled water when brushing your teeth do not leave your swimsuit in a towel you??l never see it again make sure you lay it flat to dry my bikini was accidentally taken because i left it wrapped in a towel and rushed out to meet the friends for dinner mysteriously no one could find it for me in laundry services so be mindful of the swimsuits the resort : takes about 30 minutes to get there from the airport and it makes for a pretty cool trip you get to see how the people live ( third world very poor ) but it?? really interesting you know for sure you are on vacation ? no mcdonald?? , home depots and any of the other crap we have lining our highways it?? a half paved road and at times you feel you may crash into oncoming traffic or a guy on a donkey the resort grounds are lovely there are animals ?? fed a duck and named him afflack there are parrots ( lovers ) and flamingoes and random chickens , rabbits very cute this is mostly by the entrance way the pool area doesn?? have animals but the water is deeeelish not too cold not too warm the best pool is over by rooms in the 2?? and 3?? it has a waterfall and it?? quiet and the bar service there ( although not swim up ) is good the food : breakfast is good you have a lot of selection and they make fresh omlettes right there the bacon is strange so opt instead for the hash brows ( so good ) and the scrambled eggs , fresh fruit , pancakes , crepes , french toast and 100 other things to choose from the downside ? the juices weren?? that cold and they all have pulp so i stuck to champagne with pineapple juice lunch : service at the pool is limited they cook on the beach but it?? not good at all ? dry chicken , overcooked burgers , don?? bother with any of the food on the beach it?? not easy to eat poolside you can tell they encourage people to dine in the two main places for lunch the grill and la toscana la toscana has deeelish pizzas which you can take to go ??lthough they don?? encourage this la toscana is buffet and the grille is sit down lunch both good but if you want to get back to the pool or beach in under an hour leat at la toscana the grille is more of a sit down hang out enjoy lunch type of lunch dinner : the grille was the favorite but general tip if you are ordering steak and expect it to be prepared correctly you must ask for it ??edium rare con sangre ( with blood ) i?? puerto rican so i know that hispanics tend to overcook their beef so when ordering a steak con sangre ??hat will get you the cooked but pink and juicy on the inside the grille is open air and deeeelish at night i advise to get to dinner by 8:00 ? 8:30 at the latest to avoid crowds and crappy service toscana : it?? italian if you are used to nyc italian you??l be fine but not at all impressed if italian to you means olive garden , you??l love it the little disc bread they give is amamzing better if they topped it with garlic and olive oil chez isabelle : lovely d?cor , food was decent again not blowing me away but an enjoyable meal i had the chicken husband had the chateau briand and they overcooked it we told the couple seated next to us to make sure they order it ??on sangre , ? later saw them at the club and he said it was great the beach : ahhhhh what a fantastic relaxing breeeeze the sun in july isn?? as strong as the sun in mexico but it will get you toasty 
paradise island but not much to do overall a lovely break - the hotel was spotless and the staff amazing - isael  francisco were so much fun and the maids work so hard we tipped them every day although they dont expect it the pool was amazing and as for the beach , i have seen nothing like it the down side is ( well for us ) that there really is not much else to do - this suits some i appreciate the trips are all average and not worth the money ( except the helicopter transfer which i highly recommend for ?140 for 2 back to the airport ) the staff are really friendly but you sometimes feel hassled to join into silly games the watersports equipment amounts to just boogie boards really i know this is now seeming a bit negative but it is an amazing hotel with attention to detail and great service but the type of holiday itself is perhaps the mistake i made as you need to be a sun worshiper who likes to do nothing more than read or swim , which , like i say is great for some people i know a lot of couples that said 2 weeks was too long and so i am glad we just enjoyed the week we had i would definately not upgrade to the excellence club as it is more money for nothing although they try to upsell it to you the food was lovely and my only regret is that i didnt try the lobster house the room was air cond fine and was a nice room with jacuzzi bath etc but none of the other communal areas of the hotel are air conditioned just so you know - it bothered some as it obviously gets very close and muggy in summer i think if you like beach holidays this is absolubtely for you an amazing hotel , staff and range of places to eat and drink 
beautiful resort , watch out for the food the resort was phenomenal the staff when we stayed for our honeymoon was plenty nice and always helpful we had a great time for the most part but it was interrupted by a overnight stay in the hospital the third night of our honeymoon intestinal parasite is what they said i became so dehydrated that i passed out , which i have never done in my life , scared my husband to death and actually by the grace of god , the first person to our rescue while i was unconscious was a paramedic and his wife from new york ( hugo and ginger ) thank you the best professional i saw anyways most of the day and the night in the hospital and a day or two to actually feel better , put a damper on our honeymoon we were able to salvage it and still had a good time , but we left a little disappointed about the outcome of our honeymoon the resort should of had medicine to combat intestinal parasites we did not get to do all that we wanted because we felt ill to many days but the last couple of days we were fine and enjoyed our time and made the best of it form what i see they have gone down since then research carefully and take a look at other options before deciding 
honeymoon from hell let me start out by saying when i was told about secrets excellence in punta cana on paper it sounded like the dreamvacation we always wanted for our honeymoon reality set in when we were there to the point we both started a mantra ,  excelente every time something went wrong , all the time wishing our honeymoon would be over the room - we arrived way past check in time but the room was not ready thedesk sent us to get lunch and assured us the room would be ready afterlunch the maids were still not done - they were buffing the floors which lead my husband to the first trip to the front desk eventually we got in the room andit looked beautiful and since we had a balcony we stepped out on it to see the view we had requested so many months ago we got a view of the service building with the help trekking in  out at all hours the best thing i saw was the same individual spitting each day in front of our building i went down to ask the desk if we could get a room with a view as we had initiallyasked to get they explained that the really good rooms were only given to the excellence club to which we could not be a part of it was not a question of extra money we would have paid it was just a matter that there were no more people being accepted so we dealt with that but being in the pool welearned a different truth people were being upgraded without asking and without paying for it i still do not know why we could not be a part of that club but i could deal with it if the room was not plagued with some other troubling factors - ants/ power outages and the toilet not flushing and my husband having to physically stick his hand in the top half of the toilet to fix it the ring - my husband got his wedding ring stolen off his finger while we were getting a massage he was not used to wearing a ring so hedid not realize it was gone for a few hours we went back to the spot on the beach where we got the massage there we were confronted by two guards wielding shotguns scary - especially since we were trying to convey in broken spanish that we had lost the ring they allowed us to look and told us all stuff found would be turned into the concierge desk the next morning my husband went to the conciergewho made a call to the lost and found they told me they would call around - husband went back to the beach massage place where he watched the guy cleaning up search through the towels he then went back to the concierge who acted likeit was the first time he told them this he went down to the spa and continued down to the club concierge never followed up it was notexpensive in price but it was in sentimentality room service - we needed to set up breakfast in bed we were told the onlytime available was 10:30am - it was late but we agreed to it next morning we wait and wait breakfast never comes eventually we get a call telling us that our breakfast will be coming husband called a half hour after that tofindout what was going on they told me that it went out 5 min ago we waste more time husband called back up to cancel this lead him to yet another trip to the concierge meanwhile we are starved and need to wait another 1/2 hr for any restaurants to open for lunch we are told to book again this time at 8am in the morning it came on time but was disgusting it looked as if they saved the meal from yesterday to serve itto us we are physically ill after eating it we continue to beill for the res of the trip dinner on the beach husband could not eat it - not a bit of it - due to afore - mentioned room service incident i was able to eat and got ill the next morning i also got about 50 bug bites on each leg that kept her up at night even with bug spray on hospital trip - we were supposed to go on a catamaran excursion but could not because i had to run to the bathroom i looked pale and was dehydrated so husband called the resort doctor who i think is adoctor like dr pepper is a doctor , sooo pepper called medical transport who brought me via wheelchair to medical services where dr pepper shoved an iv in my wrist to replenish fluids , we traveled via ambulance to the punta canahospital half an hour away we were told it was a 15 minute ride and wewould need to stay for about 2 hours we stayed for 8 hours i gave a blood and urine sample joyce was told that she probably had an intestinal parasite told us that is what most people that come in have if this is the case why does not the resort have medication on the premise totreat this condition clarification of this was never given because we never got the results of the test that and no one could translate for us we were brought upstairs where i was given antibiotics via the iv and something else that knockedme out nurses came in and out but no one ever asked if she was feeling better and we never saw the doctor again when my husband asked if i could leave soon they called me animpatient caucasian yet needed to get another patient to translate initially we were told that the transportation back to the resort is provided by the excellence this is not thecase around 7pm a nurse came in and handed us a bag of three differentdrugs and finally took the iv out when we got outside the hospital i felt faint and nauseous and had to sit down on the curb ( our cab left ) we went back inside the hospital but we left once i got her color back when we got back homemy arm was infected from the iv prieto tours - my husband went to them to explain to them why we did not show up for the catamaran trip he was told to show them proof could not he just call the concierge or the on resort doctor i went up to my room and brought down the only paper we received from the hospital eventually they agreed togive me my money back but we lost more time conclusion - we will never ever go back to punta cana we returned home more exhausted and more stressed than when i left the things that were good about this place were so few and outnumbered by the bad 
shame on excellence be aware that you may come home with a food born pathogen we recently stayed at excellence , punta cana my husband and i were on our honeymoon i ca not explain just how bad it is there that is all excellence has going for them from the minute we arrived they began the games for more of our money and allot of services that were never received do not upgrade it 's a scam just to get more money we learned the hard way and our honeymoon felt more like a job we constantly were lied to and treated poorly from the staff at the front desk i hope they change owners and clean house of thier horrible employees that give the good people of the dominican a bad name shame on them if you have terrible taste buds and like glamorized buffett food thats rotten , this is the palace for you just be sure you bring antibiotics from whatever infection you could possibly receive we have traveled all over , this by far was a huge disappointment i would never return to such a dreadful place please reseach other resorts , the dominican is a beautiful country save time , happiness and frustration and stay away from this hell hole , they call a resort tampa , florida 
went on honeymoon rough waters this is on the atlantic not the caribean so the water is not that calm blue that you would expect i was not told and was quite disapointed as i love that typical caribben water the staff was good altho hard to communicate b/c most only speak spanish and very broken english i would say if you speak spanish def go to the dom if not i would not really bother 
terrible staff and food my wife and i decided to try excellence based on some of the reviews that we found on trip advisor , everything seemed great unfortunately , we had a different experience from what others have had to say we 've been to sandals about 4 times in the bahamas , jamacia and st lucia and did compare excellence to sandals first off i will say that the resort is very beautiful and the grounds , beach , pools are well kept our problems began with something that was not the resort 's fault , but usairways they lost our bags for 2 of the four nights we were there but we had our swimsuits at least but just the clothes on our backs so , since we did not have the appropriate attire to eat at most of the restaurants and nightlife , we ate at the lobster house the first night since it was casual a few hours after eating there , i began feeling a bit nauseous tried to get something from the market/pharmacy around 8pm , but it was closed i ended up being up all night vomiting and other things i had not drank any water ( other than bottled of course it is bottle in the dominican republic ) so it had to be food poisoning , especially how quicklly it came on i spent most of the next day in bed trying to recover did i mention that our toilet broke ( would not flush ) a few times that evening and overnight due to that , and that the ac did not work properly and the elevator was broken ( we were on the 3rd floor ) , we changed rooms the staff did not seem to really care that i ended up with food poisoning apparently after speaking with other guests and reading a few other new reviews , this is not all to uncommon as i said , we 've stayed in other all - inclusive resorts and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were happy the staff at excellence seems to view guests as a nuisannce ( we were not the only ones that thought so either ) the drinks were weak , and the other food we ate was not all that great other than the french place it was not all bad , the pools and beach are great the micheal jackson show was amazing , and the two parrots are very cool as for the rest , bring in a new staff that cares about its guests ( there were some that were friendly , but not many ) , drastically improve the food and drink situation and it would be a great place that i would recommend , but right now i say stay away 
great vacation we stayed at this resort from 6-29 to 7-8 it was our first time to punta cana the staff was very friendly the beach is great you have the choice of waves or calm if you walk down the beach a bit although the food was tasty we felt the food at secrets capri , mexico is much better the best restaurant is the barcelona at night it was nice to have a lively night club and casino do not forget bug spray if you do horse back riding shopping was fun at the huts bring them a cold drink for a better price hut #6 was easiest to deal with , nancy and cheapy charlie i 'm sure you 'll have a wonderful trip please e - mail with any questions 
a beautiful resort as we arrived to the resort after a long day of travelling we were thrilled to see that excellence was the nicest of all the resorts we saw along the route from the airport we were greeted with champagne and smiles before we were told that our honeymoon suite was not available which was the biggest disappointment of our trip they had apologized and gave us a walk out poolside room along with an excellence club membership for compensation it did not take too long for us to forget about the honeymoon suite we had booked months in advance and did not get the room was beautiful and the walkout poolside was a definite plus the staff was excellent always smiling and helpful which was the best customer service i have ever seen at an all - inclusive resort there were several restaurants to choose from and always plenty of food to eat at anytime i 'd rate the food an 8 out of 10 depending on which restaurant there was plenty of entertainment at the resort like bands , dancers , shows , etc our particular favorite entertainer was domingo , a saxophonist that was second to none overall i 'd have to say that the punta cana excellence resort exceeded my expectations i would definitely recommend this resort for honeymooners or any other couples looking for a romantic getaway honeymooners from michigan june 2007 
an incredibly beautiful resort the morning after our wedding , my new husband  i got on a non - stop flight and landed at the punta cana airport we had pre - booked transport to the resort with prieto tours when we set up the whole trip via the american express website on arrival , the bus going to the excellence resort was already full by the time we got our luggage , and the prieto staff quickly called up another bus for us and another couple heading to a different resort in the same area the air conditioned ride to the excellence resort took a little over an hour , was comfortable , and gave us the opportunity to see a bit of the countryside in that part of the dr lots of construction work and construction refuse scarring the landscape , which was otherwise coverd with lush , short scrubby greenery the towns and pockets of housing showed that some dominicans are faring better than others , but many of the houses were not much more than shacks this confirmed what we had heard about crushing poverty in the country the excellence resort is an astonishingly beautifully designed place every time i walked through the grounds i would notice some architectural element or artistic touch that i had not noticed before it is a perpetual feast for the eyes the grounds are lushly landscaped , and there are fountains , pools , and aquariums everywhere do not miss the flamingos and parrots near the gift shops the photos i 've seen posted here on trip advisor are true to life , so i wo not post any more now , about the staff : shout out  to the best entertainment team on the planet , including julio , ines  louis they are fun and professional , energetic and friendly god only knows how they deliver with a smile from morning till night every day , but they do volleyball on the beach during the day , dancing on the resort plaza in the evening , performing onstage at night , and more and all of it with good humor  magnificent style and my favorite person on the wait staff , natanael , a wonderfully personable young man who served us our on our very first evening in the lobster house and a couple of times thereafter , and with whom we shared a few laughs about the breakfast cereal selection several days later ( fiber , yeah i wish we 'd had a chance to tell natanael goodbye and thank you , but i think he was on his days off during our last days there benjamin , the wonderful bartender at st domingo plaza who always served cheerfully , and was generous beyond the call of duty when he offered us his plate of paella when my husband and i missed a special luncheon on the beach and there was also francisco , who gave us a basic spanish lesson overall , the resort is staffed with friendly , competent people i dissolved into tears of amazement when i saw the view from our room it was so beautiful ocean view , overlooking the pool the room itself was lovely , a very soothing environment our only major complaint about our stay at excellence - - and this is major - - is the mattress profoundly uncomfortable , like sleeping on a concrete slab by the fifth day of our ten - day stay , my back was out of wack , and i had trouble moving part of every day until my spine could settle itself into reallignment we 've been back home for a few days , and i am still having occasional twinges in my lower back i am accustomed to sleeping on a tempurpedic , or on an extra firm mattress with a pillowtop - - so if you are likewise not accustomed to a hard , bare - bones type of mattress , you may find the mattresses at the resort less than comfortable why such an oppulently designed and appointed resort would skimp on mattress quality is a mystery to me finally , the food : it was our first all inclusive experience , so it was nice to be able to walk into one of the several restaurants and just order what we wanted our favorite was the lobster house for dinner and for breakfast ( no , no lobsters for breakfast ) , and spice ( the pan - asian restaurant ) montezuma came to visit me the morning after dinner at chez isabelle , and i do not know if it was the liver mousse appetizer or that after six days my body had had all it could stand of the water ( i have a nasty habit of chewing ice - - which would make me vulnerable in spite of the resort serving bottled the only improvement we would suggest in the restaurants is for the lunch and dinner menus at each restaurant to vary every three days or so sometimes there were only one or two items on a restaurant menu that suited our tastes , so we would not return to that restaurant often if at all because the menus did not change overall food was most often well - prepared and interesting , although we were surprized at how often the chefs were way too heavy - handed with the salt ( never at the lobster house we loved the adults - only atmosphere , and it was really a pleasure in this divorce - ridden world to see so many couples - - of a variety of ages - - truly enjoying one another our excursion to the city of st domingo ( prieto tours ) was an interesting and very informative ( but grueling ) 12- hour trip the benefit was in really seeing much more of the real dominican republic ( the resort , after all , is just a fabricated environment , not a cultural product ) , and hearing from the tour guide about a lot of history and contemporary sociopolitical and economic issues our trip would not have been complete without it , unless we had not cared to have some kind of genuine encounter with the nation the resort is situated in - - which might be ok for some people it was a dream honeymoon and no , we did not pay extra for the honeymoon package the amenities offered to all guests were quite enough for us , and we had the time of our lives 
excellente we had an amazing trip room : beautiful and relaxing we were on the 3rd floor and we loved the high ceilings we had an excellence club junior suite in building 7 and the location was good it was cleaned promptly and thoroughly each day we were disappointed with our mini - bar as the fridge was not cold and we really only drank the bottled water also , we did not get our fresh flowers upon check - in until the night before we left and we never got a newspaper beach : gorgeous never crowded but not empty good activities ( volleyball , dance and cooking lessons ) , plenty of pulapos , hammocks and chairs wide beaches with tall palm trees - so beautiful wish there were more cabanas on excellence club beach but we were told that they were being replaced next week pool : inviting , clean and relaxing who can be stressed when floating on a raft with a cocoloco in hand we loved blue ( swim up bar ) and had many a tasty drink there lots of socializing and meeting other guests in the pool and that was fun wish that there were more large pulapos - guests would reserve them by throwing their towels there at like 7am and you have no chance at getting one tennis : we took a helpful and fun tennis lesson with rolando who was a great instructor with a great personality courts were nice and this was well worth the $20 per hour for both of us give a nice tip - rolando deserves it activities : i took advantage of the horseback riding and while it was a unique experience , the horses were a bit sad - looking shopping was limited overall , but we got some great deals with nancy and cheapie charlie at stall #6 the vendors that were selling jewelry on the santo domingo plaza sold the same items for 3 times the price food : my biggest complaint about the resort was that the food was disappointing we were not expecting greatness and we did not get it there is plenty of variety , but the quality is not very good breakfast in toscana had huge selection but it was rather bland lunch options were limited and we ate at the grill everyday and it was slow everyday which was frustrating dinner was better at the grill ( nice filet mignon ) , chez isabelle was fine ( salad was strange ) , and agave was ok ( fajitas not served with anything but tortillas and a few sad grilled onions and peppers ) we were only there for 3 nights , so maybe we did not make good choices , but i was disappointed bars : we certainly enjoyed blue ( swim - up pool bar ) and kafe cafe nice cold presidente at the sports bar loved the cocoloco and excellence sunrise bartenders were pleasant and efficient good variety of drinks that were not that strong ( good for me to try many tasty drinks without getting too tipsy club : we did the excellence club and i do not know that it was necessary in an all - inclusive resort with abundant food and drink everywhere you turn the service was excellente at the club ( franklin was very attentive ) and good everywhere else the hors doeurves in the afternoon were not very good , but the waiters were good and it was nice to have a cold beer in the air conditioning while checking email nightlife : the shows were entertaining and we were suprised to see that practically everyone at the resort came to see them every night i wish that alegria and the other clubs were open prior to 11:00pm in case you wanted to dance rather than sit through the shows one major complaint : there were 2 mimes entertaining the guests one night and this was just bizarre to me i hate mimes and i was so freaked out i had to leave the show area and run to the martini bar i so do not need a mime at a caribbean resort and some other guests agreed overall , we loved our short but sweet trip and would highly recommend the resort 
relaxing , relaxing , relaxing just spent a week at excellence punta cana the weather was awesome i 'll get my complaints out of the way first the lobster house was a huge disappointment we ate there our first night and the lobster was over cooked , though i truly believe it just depends on the cook because other guests said their meals were very good the ice machine in our building was out of order the entire week to receive ice from room service was a minimum 45 minute wait the minibar is not very cold maybe it 's just me , but i like my drinks cold you do not get slippers or a pillow menu unless you upgrade to the excellence club so if you actually look at the hotel website and read what is offered with your room do not count on those items the maid service was so - so 3 x 's our room was cleaned very late in the day i 'm talking after 5:00 p i found this a little annoying since that 's about the time we wanted to shower from a day at the pool and get ready for dinner we would have to sit and wait on the balcony while the maid cleaned now , this is a very nice resort the grounds and pool are very well maintained the rooms are nice and adequate for as much time as your going to spend in them the majority of the employees and wait staff are very friendly and accomodating martin , who works in agave ( the mexican restaurant ) and barcelona ( the mediterranean restaurant ) was definitely our favorite waiter the pool was wonderful and very relaxing right outside of our building was the pool with the small waterfall we found this to be our favorite spot to be since the waterfall added an additional soothing quality there was a wonderful breeze coming off the ocean most days if you 're looking for a great place to relax and basically do not much of anything , this is a wonderful choice they do have plenty of activities going on every day from stretching on the beach to volleyball to dance lessons to horseback riding and everything in between we did do the free horseback riding and the only thing i can say about that is i 'm glad i did not pay for it and i felt extremely sorry for the horses they looked to be under nourished in my eyes and i almost felt bad getting on one it 's an okay ride , but if you 're really wanting to ride as a couple basically you 'll be riding on your own with 10-12 other people around you and you 'll be lucky if you can get you and your other halves horse to stay together the beach is nice but not white sand like we would have expected and you will not be snorkeling in front of this resort since there are good size waves and the water is pretty rough most of the restaurants are fine but there are only 2 places to go for breakfast and one is open from 7 am to 10:30 and the other is open from 10:30 to noon only 2 places open for lunch as well , though there are snack bars and they do come around the pool and offer small pizzas the mexican restaurant was our favorite the beef and shrimp fajitas were quite good we also really enjoyed chez isabelle ( the french restaurant ) service was a little slow but the meal was very good you 'll find you have excellent waiters and then some that just take their time , but overall the presentation in all the restaurants is very nice and they do try to satisfy there is sometimes a language barrier we tend to like our steaks pink and juicy and they like to cook them done , so you really have to work to make them understand what you want the michael jackson show was excellent also saw a dominican dance show but the circus the last night of our stay we watched about 10 minutes and left i did truly enjoy my time there , but would i go back i think i 'd like to try another part of the carribean oh , but if you have the chance definitely do the helicopter ride back to the airport they claim it 's a 30 minute ride , but we did not get 30 minutes , but irregardless , it was worth every penny i 'd never been in a helicopter before and it was one of the most awesome experiences of my life 
potential for excellence but falls short my wife and i celebrated our anniversary with another couple the week of june 2nd -9th and found the resort to be a welcome break from the stresses of our daily lives while overall this trip was very enjoyable and at times ecstatic , as a veteran carribean traveller i 've got to give an honest review highlighting the good , the bad and the ugly : the good : excellence punta cana is a beautiful resort and is impeccably clean the hotel staff work very hard to keep the grounds , pool and beach spotless and well - manicured if you are considering upgrading to the excellence club i can assure you that it is definitely worth it upon check - in we were welcomed with champagne , taken to the excellence club for hors d 'ouvres and orientation , then led to our rooms which were supplied with fresh fruit , a bottle of chilled champagne , a completely stocked wetbar with premium liquors and extra tolietries we loved the seemingly endless pool which runs the length of the property and spent most of our afternoons relaxing in the water while sipping frozen drinks without exception , every bartender and server we encountered was friendly and professional and made us feel at home the beach was very nice but almost unbearably hot at this time of year as many have said the surf is strong so weak swimmers may want to steer clear of the ocean the spa was wonderful and we enjoyed our swedish massages tremendously breakfast and lunch usually found us at toscana for the diverse buffet i recommend the fresh fruit smoothies for a good natural energy drink finally , the nightlife was sometimes cheesy but overall enjoyable we particularly enjoyed the circus show , the disco ( the dance floor was always jumping ) and the casino ( loose slots but only about 20 machines to choose from and only in quarter denomination ) the bad : - much to our dismay , the food offerings here are not of the caliber you will find at a typical four star resort in some cases it was too spicy , in others it was too bland agave , the mexican restaurant , was closed for the entireity of our trip yet no one on staff could explain why barcelona ( mediterranean ) and spice ( oriental ) were not good and i do not recommend dinner at either - oddly , every ice machine at the resort went out of order from sunday until thursday for a while we were able to get ice from the excellence club but by wednesday afternoon even room service could not supply any ice the vendors who come onsite in the evenings to sell jewelry and souveniers will quote you ridiculously exhorbitant prices for their goods and are not willing to negotiate the general attitude is you are american , so you can afford it in fact this was actually said to my wife by one of the vendors when she tried to bargain with him like most carribean resorts , it remains very hot and humid in the evening since the dress codes require men to wear long pants for dinner at most restaurants , you can expect to be drenched in perspiration before the evening is over make sure to bring thin , breathable garments the ugly : - room service was a complete joke we encountered language barriers , untrained staff answering the phones who did not know the menu , wait times of up to 90 minutes and botched orders not once did we receive exactly what we ordered we booked an excursion through the hotel for deep sea fishing it was a complete rip - off and i urge you to avoid this particular excursion at all costs we were told our boat would hold five passengers , would be covered to provide shade and would be stocked with beer , energy drinks , water , soda and snacks when we arrived there were seven passengers , no shading unless you went below deck (8-10 foot swells made this option impossible ) no snacks , a dozen bottles of water and two 1- liter bottles of coke we were shown a box and told that for $40 dollars we could have the beer and energy drinks inside we told the operator to take a hike our guides were teenagers with very little fishing experience and we only caught a small sailfish neither myself nor my wife even touched a fishing pole half the boat got sick from heat exhaustion needless to say we demanded a refund from the tour agent but neither he nor the hotel management seemed concerned and that is why i can only give three stars to a beautiful hotel with wonderful staff overall i still loved excellence punta cana but hated the dominican republic and will not be back 
excellent but take bug spray we visited excellence 21st may - 28th , had a wonderful holiday , this place is lovely , the staff are there for you all the time and want you to enjoy their hotel they work very hard and try to please you we met some lovely people from all over the world hello to the honeymooners in chicago the surroundings of the hotel is stunning , very relaxing , the pool is huge food is good , no buffetts all picked from a menu and freshly cooked rooms are very clean we had a sea view , junior suite , the swim out rooms was just below us the honey moon suites are fantastic entertainment ( shows ) is ok , the entertainment team are very good and try to get everyone involved , but no pressure if you just want to watch and relax the only negative thing is we went in may rainy season , it was for a special occasion , which we thoroughly enjoyed , but we also got biten badly by sand fleas/flies on the beach you must spray before you enter the beach , this did not only happen to us , a lot of people there got biten badly too since arriving home we have been on antibiotics incase of any infection the hotel is aware of the problem , they spray everywhere to keep things under control , and plough the beach every morning our tour operator told us just spray after 4pm , which we did , but the damage was already done yes i would go back its lovely go and enjoy it but , i am not sure if i could go on the beach again there , we have been to other hotels along the coast in dominican and never had this problem , not even had one bite before all i can say to any one going is spray your legsand body and enjoy 
not excellent this is our third trip to the dr , and we have been to a few other places as well this was one of the best all - inclusives we have been to the food and drink service on the beach was great for the first 2 days , but for the next 5 days this service almost disappeared the excellence club is worth the extra money if you like a small quiet place to have food or drink in the ac in a lounge type atmosphere this club has food service from 7am to 11pm , and often it was better than the food available in the many tasty restaurants we did not think the swim up room was worth the extra money - since the doors cannot lock from the outside , you cannot really go to the pool this way however , it was nice if you like to sit outside and sip coffee while overlooking the pool in general , the service was excellente , and we especially enjoyed talking with emilio in the excellence club , juan on the beach , and reyna at the pool bar 
flying solo at excellence in may i headed off to excellence in may for a long weekend , and did so without my husband who had conflicts i figured no big deal - however it certainly seemed to be for the hotel itself i was continually contested on my soloness - at breakfast , lunch , dinner , by the maids , etc it seemed an impossible concept to understand this was not hugely offensive , it is a couples resort after all that 's my point , i guess - it is a couples resort i upgraded to the excellence club , which essentially meant there was food out all day long - which was true for the rest of the resort as well the rooms were fine i had a swim out room which was convenient the pool and beach were really wonderful , which is how this review caps its average rating annoying : maids entered my room 4-5 times a day for different reasons i was never approached by the pool and offered a drink at any time in my 5 day stay ( though i watched it happen all day long for other folks ) the internet connection was spotty and inconsistent i waited 2 hours for my luggage once i checked it i eventually went and retrieved it myself , which did not go over so well - but the pool closes at 5p and i wanted to get a dip in on my first day realities : this hotel is a solid hour+ ( more like 90 minutes once it is all said and done ) from the airport the restaurants are so - so the staff is very nice and very sweet take bug dope - lots of mosquitos cabs cost about $60 and are a tiny bit more convenient than a transfer with a company and a van spa : i do not recommend at all i had two treatments - both very amateurish and weak actually , one was downright laughable a woman who confessed she was a manucurist just played with my hair for 30 minutes , vs giving me a head massage this is not a legit spa if you are going for handwork , do not waste your time weather in may : it was perfectly perfect as far as temperature there were rain showers late morning and thunderstorms at night i found that to be kind of nice and varied 
excellence is excellente my husband and i stayed at excellence last week for our 10 year anniversary and had a fabulous time we chose this resort because it was adults only and it was well worth it everyone was so friendly that we came in contact with they would all say hola everytime they passed you the entertainment staff from starting your day with louis and inez ( waki ) stretching or dancing the night away at the club with franklin doing the taki taki dance these are the hardest working people i have ever seen they keep you motivated even when it is raining it rained half the time we were there but like i said , there was plenty to do the food was okay our favorite restaurant was the chez isabelle which was french cuisine the drinks are always flowing wether you are at the bar or on the beach ( yes , they will bring them right out to you ) you have to try the mama juana we took a half day excursion and went out on atv 's it was a blast and we got to see how the natives lived definitely worth the money if you are planning on visiting punta cana , bring bug spray because the bugs are bad also , bring plenty of sunscreen because the sun is hot even at 8 am i hope this review helps you out you will have a good time if you stay at excellence 
beware - food poisoning is a huge problem this review will brief because my husband and i did not get to experience much of the resort during our stay ( may 28 - june 2) my husband got severe food poisoning on our first day ( he did not drink the water ) after several hours of severe vomiting , i called the resort doctor although the doctor was responsive , the language barrier was a huge problem we ended up in an ambulance that took us to a dominican hospital where no one spoke english you can only imagine how scary this was for both of us we spent the night at the hospital with no english communication about what was wrong with my husband the hospital sent us back to the resort with some medicine but my husband never got better he was so sick for the next few days that we had to leave our honeymoon early we were in the excellence club and they upgraded us to a new room for our troubles the new room was great and we were very glad we had it because we never left it - he was too sick we had such high hopes for excellence but cannot recommend it because of our nightmare experience with the food we will not be returning 
frist time to the domincian republic we just returned from the excellence punta cana in the dominican republic after a week long stay the resort property was one of the most beautiful places i have seen the resort is very clean , and the groundskeepers are constantly at work making sure every plant , flower , and tree is just right a unique touch that this resort has is the wildlife in the main lobby they have a few turtles in the lake in the main lobby , they have flamingos down near the shops on the resort , a wild turkey and baby roam the resort throughout the day , and 2 talking parrots near the stores , that will great you with an hola once you land , it is just about an hour bus ride from the airport to the resort once you arrive , you will be greeted with a glass of champagne , and a cold towel to help you relax and refresh after your travels rooms : the rooms are very nice and clean if you get a room on the 3rd floor , you get the added benefit of nice vaulted ceilings which make the room feel massive we stayed in building 8, and our air conditioning in the room did not really work all that well we brought it to the attention of the excellence club at least 3 times , but nothing was ever resolved which upset me you room was cleaned every day , and your mini bar was always restocked , and they also provide a turn down service every night pools and beach : the pool is unbelievable it is just massive and very very clean there is always something going on at the pool water volleyball , water polo , just tossing around a football the pools has a nice selection of chairs that are in the sun , or chairs that rest on the ledge of the pool with water right below you , or in the shade covered by a leafy umbrella if you are looking for a nice place in the shade you will unfortunately have to get up early (7:30am ) to throw your stuff on to reserve it that is one of my biggest criticisms of the resort , and some people would reserve seats in the shade , and you would not see them all day until they grabbed their stuff at 5:00pm the beach is one of the nicest i have ever seen the beach is not as popular as the pool ( further away from the bars ) , but is a nice place to relax and their always seemed to be a nice constant breeze to cool you off the water was the perfect temperature , and you could go way out into the water and it would not be above your chest i highly recommend walking along the beach , but prepare yourself if you walk to left left ( facing the water ) , you will be pounced upon by vendors that want you to see what they are selling if that is not your thing , i would walk to the right i only know of 1 vendor to the right food : the food was good my personal favorite restaurant was spice ( japanese ) , and the other couple we went with really enjoyed the french restaurant as well the service was fantastic at the french restaurant , and the food was very good as well the italian restaurant the food was average at best , and the service was very slow all of the restaurants are not open every night , so you will need to check the schedule you get when the turn down service comes around to see if the restaurant you want to go to is open service : for the most part the service was ok , nothing fantastic i personally felt that almost everyone there was looking for a tip there were a few people , that were very friendly and social , but over all most of the staff just responded with a forced excellente or it is our pleasure i have also been to sandals where they will not accept tips , and received better service i took about $100 to tip people with ( bartenders , baggage men , servers ) and even when we tipped them , i did not feel as though they appreciated it they just took the money , and wondered off and we did not get any better treatment overall , it was a very nice trip the resort was easily one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen , very clean , and overall it was a very nice trip i would recommend going to excellence punta cana 
the best experience i just returned from a wonderful stay at excellence punta cana resort i , along with two girlfriends , enjoyed a 5 day/4 night stay prior to booking we did go through the reviews on thsi site and can honestly say that most are fairly accurate the resort definitely caters to couples but we knew this before booking and did not mind overall , we loved our stay and highly recommend it it is certainly the best all - inclusive resort that i have experienced the staff was great especially francisco and louis on the activity staff and one of the banquet managers the entire staff was extremely attentive to whatever you needed and seemed to genuinely want you to have a great time a few of the best highlights include : *the grounds and overall look of the resort are beautiful they are well mainted *the quality of the rooms was superior *the food , in most cases , was pretty good ( superior to other all inclusive reosrts i have experienced ) here are a few things that i thought needed improvement : *i enjoy a firm mattress however , i found the bed to be extremely hard and uncomfortable i woke up after the first two nights with an aching back *there were little things in the room that did not work properly ( we stayed in room 12102) : the iron did not work we had to hold the handle down on the toilet for it to flush and the refrigerator in our room did not seem to keep drinks very cold *during breakfast or any of the buffet meals there were often times when something was out it did not seem like items were refreshed quickly enough *the majority of the restaurants for dinner were full service while the waiters were very nice it often took a long time to receive our meals at the italian restaurant we waited for 1 hour after we ordered 
good value i was hooked on tripadvisor before i went away on this vacation i could not wait for the trip because everybody wrote such amazing reviews basically a lot of what you read is correct , but it 's very important to remember that a 4 star hotel in the dr is not the same as a 4 star hotel that we 're used to in the northeast if you think you 're going to some luxury resort , then you are mistaken , but if you think you 're going to a true island getaway , then you have the right idea i traveled with a group of 3 married couples we 're all very good friends and in our late 20's , early 30's this is an adults only resort , so there are obviously no children a lot of people staying here are much older much , much , older a lot of newlyweds as well if i came here with a group of girlfriends i would be very upset unless you call that dark room with 90's black lightallegria disco something to do if you are a single guy/girl looking for a good time , head to mexico , not here but we were there for relaxation and some quality time together away from our hectic work lives , so it was fine the drive from the airport is about an hour the scenery is interesting and seeing the locals just live is amazing makes you think twice about your nice house , computer , fancy car , expensive dinners , designer bags , and flat screens back at home room : getting our rooms was such an ordeal one of us had two beds instead of a king and they could not do anything about it in that room the air condition broke and there was a huge leak in the ceiling amazingly enough , they got a new room this time with a king bed , anda lizard but that 's another story for another time on our third night , my husband and i were sound asleep he woke me up in a panic there was a flood in our room one of the pipes had burst and there was already about 4 inches of water in the room my shoes were floating around he called the front desk , once they finally understood him ( key note : brush up on your spanish before going to the dr ) they asked if it could wait for morning i ran outside and managed to get one of the security guards he came in and said oh my god , you ca not stay here well , no kidding then as i stood in my pajamas soaked , i watched while a crew of cleaners , security , office personnel , and curious passerbys examined our room wait a minute , did i say there was not any excitement here so we packed up our stuff ( yes , now it is 3 a m ) and walked in the pitch black ( serious issues with lighting in the rooms area ) to a far away area they gave us a suite another note : do not even think about upgrading to a suite it was dark , grungy , small , and had the most awkward layout i had ever seen the day before we left i realized that i had forgotten a pair of gold/diamond earrings in the safe of the old room they had already put new people inside the room and the earrings were gone : ( they said they would call me at home if they turned up , but i had a feeling i would never see them again beach : the beach is beautiful they keep it very clean they do have people serving drinks and taking orders , but it 's not always consistent sometimes they go around with food , sometimes they do not a word to the wise : stock up on towels early in the day they go fast and once they 're gone you 're sol we had to bribe a worker to get some for us one day cost us $10 it rained a lot while we were there ( at night , the first two days ) so the cushions are always wet they do not help you with your chairs on the beach or anything like that be ready to fendfor yourself the water is rough one of the guys almost got pulled under and he is very athletic i only went in up until my knees the water is clean though pool : pool is nice water is warm no deep ends get your spot early though i swear i think people stake their chairs at 4 a no matterwhat time we got there , there was always tons of chairs lined with towels casino : the casino is small i played and won the first night , lost the second story of my life do not go there if you 're like me and love the lights of vegas you 'll be very disappointed 1 roulette table , 2black jack bad odds on the craps table food and drink : they tell you that there is a no reservation policy that you can getin anywhere at any time that 's a lie if i 've ever heard one most nights we waited up to 2 hours for a table 
romantic beach resort who we are - married couple in our 50's looking to veg out at a nice beach resort have been to many carribbean islands - antigua , bahamas , jamaica , puerto rico , martinique , st lucia - but this was our first visit to the dominican republic also , the only all - inclusive resort we have ever been to previously was a club med many years ago beach - the hotel is the only one on a beautiful cove about a mile long we were looking for waves , not calm , and were not disappointed other comments on this site had said there were big waves and some even said too rough to swim by caribbean standards that may be so , but we 're from the east coast while we were there , we found the waves to be equivalent to a very mild day at ocean city , md or rehoboth beach de given that , we found it amusing that they made us wear life preservers to use their boogie boards as others have mentioned , if you walked around to the next cove to the right of the hotel , there was calmer water and some pretty decent off beach snorkeling if you walked to the next cove to the left , there was construction on a new , very fancy hotel/villas when we were there , our hotel was about 2/3 full and there was plenty of room on the beach with no need to reserve loungers grounds - we though the grounds were just gorgeous everywhere you looked there was a pond or fountain and lots of flowers we especially enjoyed all the wildlife they even have containers out so you can feed the parrots , flamingos , turtles , fish etc service - excellent everyone was very friendly rooms and grounds were kept spotless service in restaurants was slow , but solicitous food - this was a little disappointing there are several different restaurants , but we thought the food was mediocre in all the ones we tried ( note - we are from the washington , dc area , so are spoiled by having so many good restaurants available the best things were the made to order omelets at breakfast and the made to order pasta at lunch the worst was the dessert - tried many baked goods and pastry - they all looked beautiful but tasted really bad your best bet - get a coco loco or frozen fruit dacri ( sp ) - very yummy and they 'll make it with or without alcohol also , during the day , there is a help yourself soft ice cream machine on the side of the main center beachfront bar one good thing is that there was always food available breakfast , lunch or dinner was being served somewhere continuously from 7 am until 11 pm , so you did not have to worry about being on a particular schedule they also had room service , but we never tried it room - our room was very nice - had a large canopy bed , couch and chairs , fridge with drinks , cable tv , safety deposit box , small balcony and , of course , the jacuzzi they asked when we checked in if we wanted to upgrade to an oceanview room , but we declined since the hotel buildings are all set back quite a bit from the beach ( i assume due to hurricanes ) , it did not seem worth it everything worked fine - air conditioning , hot water , lights etc they do have american type outlets one night we came back to the room and the jacuzzi had been filled with hot water and bubbles - very nice touch clientele - this is an adults only resort , but it 's really for couples the age range was pretty wide - from 20's to 80's , but most people were probably in their 40's to 60's seemed like people were mostly american and canadian , though i did hear some french and german all told , it 's a great place for a relaxing vacation for couples who love the beach 
excellence is excelente ( this is a long one just returned from a one week stay at excellence punta cana with my husband and two friends overall we had an awesome time this was probably the best vacation we??e taken we met some really great people along the way too ( shout out to brenda  norm , harvey  jimena , lyn  matt , chaz  i ca not remember her name so sorry , tad  kim , jordan  kate ) the weather was great every day , though apparently there was rain the week prior it rained a few nights pretty heavily but we were never really impacted by it i??e broken down my reviews by category/topic and then did overall pros and cons hope others find this helpful transportation/airport : ( b ) most guests have some type of airport transportation included in their package we could have too , but the thought of an hour long ride on a bus with stops along the way was not appealing to us we instead chose to do a taxi we were charged $60us for 4 people each way which isn?? bad ( $30pp round trip plus tip ) upon arrival at the airport you will laugh when you??e forced to have your picture taken before you can get your tourist card it?? a little random you get on one line to get the $10pp card , then you leave that line to another line right next to it and someone there collects the card immediately ( you literally hold onto the card for 30 seconds ) , then you go through immigration and on to baggage claim it was a bit hectic but not too bad we took vip taxi from the airport and on our date of departure we had the front desk call us a car no problems with either car the ride is long and bumpy the roads are barely paved if you have a woozy stomach it might be tough i get car sick , though , and i was fine the scariest part was probably going to the resort we passed by two guys wearing dark clothing and carrying machine guns? interesting to say the least but , didn?? scare us resort overall : ( a - ) wonderful it?? an older resort so you can some of the areas for improvement when you concentrate , but it?? a beautiful place they have so many people working so hard to maintain things the grounds are impeccable the wildlife is great we saw a peacock , parrots , flamingos , geese , and turtles during our stay when you arrive , you??e greeted with a cool , citrus - infused towel and a glass of champagne while your luggage is whisked away what a way to be greeted the lobby is magnificent and very much the center of life aside from the pool and beach during the day we only stayed in the large , main pool at the lobby end but we had a great time there we didn?? try the casino at all all the bars were pretty much the same went to the swim up bar once or twice there was no need to go to the bar there were waitresses all over the place always asking what you needed ordering while hanging in the pool? does it get any better than that our absolute favorite two people at the pool were juliana and francisco the biggest issue i have with the pool and resort management overall concerns the blue floats i know this is an issue at many all inclusives , but it really should be addressed there is absolutely no reason why guests should be allowed to hold onto floats for hours on end when they are not using the pool ( perhaps reading , eating , sleeping ) and may not even be at the pool for hours on end there were more times than i can count on one hand where there were floats literally sitting next to or on top of chairs for 3 or 4 hours resort managers should request all floats stay in the pool so that anyone who would like one can use one it was ridiculous or , why not have two floats per room with the room number on them so that everyone has one we used the internet caf? once and it was pretty cheap so don?? worry about bringing your laptop , unless you??e downloading photos we did not stay in the excellence club , but didn?? really see a need to we had everything we could want and saved an extra $100 per day room : ( a - ) loved our room we were on the ground level but it never presented any problems we stayed in building 1 which was great because we were so central to everything some people who stay in building 7 and up are on the other side of the resort , but nothing is too far away you just end up hanging out at a different side of the pool i took two bubble baths while i was there and they were great never had a problem with anything in the room would have been nice to have some snacks in the mini - bar and our rum was never replaced despite leaving a few tips nor did we ever get towel art but honestly , i don?? care because all i need a cleaning lady to do is clean and that was done very well the bed was a bit hard for my husband , but fine for me the best part of the room , if you asked the men at the resort , is channel 21 restaurants/food : ( b+ ) we never had a really long wait anywhere which was nice this is not a ??ake your reservations the day you arrive? or ??ou have to wear a wristband? kind of resort eat wherever you want one thing , though , come prepared with dressier resortwear than you might intend gentlemen will be required to wear long pants at most restaurants for dinner we absolutely loved having pizza , hamburgers , and nachos on the beach and by the pool we also loved the daily bbq on the beach our favorite was the dominican food day the other must eat is ~6pm they will grill by the pool near the lobby entrance you have to try the chicken 
not quite a 5 star yet an amazing setting  best beach ever ( so far ) my husband  i enjoyed our 7 night stay the grounds truly are lovely and very well maintained here 's the highlights : airport : funny when you get there because as everyone is piling off the plane , these gals grab you by the arm and a picture is taken and then they literally shove you away there 's no way around it and you have no choice we laughed about it since it seemed so abrasive , but got over it quickly you do not have to buy any of the pix and ca not see them until you 're back at the airport leaving quickest getting through customs ever beach : we could not get over how awesome this private beach area is soft sand , no rocks in the water and you can literally walk out for a long time with water still at your waist yes , there are waves ( red flags every day ) but i 'm a big sissy when it comes to water and i was in that water every day the waves are so fun been to every place in mexico and been to two hawaiian islands and this beach at excellence put all the others to shame you can walk forever we especially loved all the palm trees which are not like the 'transplanted ' ones in mexico , but cover the island there are plenty of places to rest in the shade and efficient bar service right to where you 're lounging pools : very nice and plenty of lounging room the beach is so amazing , however , we spent very little time at the pools rooms : rooms are definitely a little run down the housekeeping staff does a tremendous job cleaning them and keeping them the best they can be the rooms is an area where the management should spend some time and money they really just need some 'sprucing up ' like new paint , fix sliding doors and screens , etc the buildings need new paint and some major mold removal like i said , the rooms are lovely , just old and worn out they could also benefit from some new bed covers i 'm glad we only got the garden view room we had a swim out at the excellence mayan riviera and it was so worth it the swim outs here were too close to the noise and the patios were full of mold and mildew we got a 3rd floor ( highly recommended because of the great vaulted ceilings ) and our balcony overlooked the quiet pool it was great they would also benefit from getting rid of all the old , worn out and stained ( yes , stained a few times we got nice , new towels that were thick , but most of the time we got the old , thin ones do not count on too many washcloths either they just do not bring them often ( we had three for the whole week ) food : do not get your hopes up the food is not that great there 's a buffet for breakfast which has anything you can imagine there 's always 'hot food ' cooking stations and tons of options breakfast is good and you 'll certainly find what you want lunch is hit or miss there 's a buffet lunch which has average variety and is good for about the first two days nothing to write home about , but average food and you get over it the a la carte places for lunch are great if you like hamburgers , french fries , sandwiches etc again , not the best food dinner : pretty disappointing as far as taste is concerned the french restaurant was the best the best service , atmosphere and food toscona , the italian place , was a close second and the service was also amazing here the agave , spice , barcelona  grill were all equally below average and below average service again , food is hit or miss do not expect 5 star cuisine wo not happen staff : we were so expecting the staff to be as wonderful and accomodating as we 'd read about this was the biggest disappointment , i think we found the staff at places in mexico to be far superior in both attitude and service than this excellence some were absolutely great and did go out of their way while others were indifferent and even forgot they were waiting on you and forgot to bring things you 'd ordered you just get over it and remember that these people work horribly long hours and it 's probably difficult to maintain a high level of service when you 've been there since 6:00am and expected to stay until after 11:00pm room service : a joke , really twice they totally forgot to bring our food and after calling twice , they finally admitted that they forgot the other time we ordered a pizza they said it would take 20, no 30, no 40 minutes ( that 's how they said it over the phone we got it an hour and 15 minutes later and were alseep by then so we just told them to take it away bar drinks : also hit or miss there are only two bartenders that know how to make drinks they do not know how to make simple things like lemon drop martinis or a cosmo terrible margaritas too they have a drink of the day which will taste like the drink of the next day and the next day house wine is not that bad they use all the same 'mixes ' so your drinks really will taste pretty much the same ask for a caiparinia ( sort of like a mojito which they 've never heard of ) cocoloco also very good shows : they do the very best they can they bring in a different show each night which is probably not an easy thing to do , so applause for the person in charge of booking the shows the shows are high school quality , at best , but some people really enjoyed them we 're in the enterainment business , so we found them to be cheesy  boring , but they do a good job of trying to offer something fun every night they had the exact same shows in excellence mexico last year , so we 'd already seen them 
excellence - peaceful bliss our trip was from april 30- may 5 first let me start off saying the dominican airport is a horror and make sure you have your $10 00 cash ready to give them , the return is worse than your arrival so be prepared the ride to the hotel is about 55 minutes and although bumpy not bad , our transfer was waiting there for us to take us to the hotel we were greeted with fresh towels and champagne , our room was not ready for us , we ate at toscanna - the lunch buffet and the food was was very good , when we did check into our room it was very spacious and i most definitly reccomend the 3rd floor and ocean view - its breathtaking we had read the reviews prior and thought that the food at the hotel was going to be bad , surprisingly enough it was pretty good our favorite place to eat was chez isabella the entire staff is so welcoming - ramona , orlando , reyna , benjamin , manuel , jennifer - we love them all the resort is very clean and the staff is very attentive to your needs we had so much fun at the pool - total relaxation the beach and the ocean were incredible , it was pure beauty and bliss there is not much shopping on this resort other than the few gift shops and the vendors that come in at night - my husband did not like their pushiness but i did not mind - you just walk by and say no masand they leave you alone i personnaly liked shopping at the little shacks on the beach - nancy in shack #6 is the place to go , she 's got the best deals on jewelry , wood carviings , paintings - what ever your looking for , nancy will take care of you all in all - we loved this place , the weather was 86 and sunny everyday it did rain a few nights but only for a few minutes and we were never affected by it 
the excellence is beautiful the people are very nice and the grounds keepers are exceptional with a few changes it could be excellent no shorts or sleeveless shirts in the restaurants this was very annoying and my husband hated wearing jeans and pants , with weather that should permit vacationers to relax and wear appropriate summer clothing i am not saying to walk in with a bikini and bathing suit bottoms , but lets relax friends and i found this very disturbing we would walk into a restaurant like toscana which is a glorified buffet , excellent food , and my husband and his friends would walk in with lacoste polos and nice dressy shorts around the knee area and they would not let them in it really made them angry they need to change that rule we went on vacation with 4 other couples and the restaurants would not permit us to put nor would they put the tables together , though they were the tables adjacent to eachother in many cases we did male and female tables , so we would not have to split couples up that bothered me more than anything this policy is very silly and again angered all of us i mean , we planned a vacation to share times and dinner together but could not because of some silly rule i found them to be less than accomodating the food was ok the best was toscana and chez isabelle , the french rest barcelona was terrible , they were out of almost all the fish on the menu and said they could not make us coffee because they turned the machines off the lobster house was mediocre and the asian place had much to be desired getting a drink on the beach was like waiting for a turtle to finish a marathon i am sure if it was a cash bar more staff would have been assigned to drinks on the beach , not just the bar area and what annoyed me the most was we always left tips , only until friends of ours befriended the waitstaff did we get drinks and service it really stinks for others i lay on the beach for three hours to the right of the bar closest to the gazebo and the beds and not one drink great all inclusive the best was the pool area near building 1 it was never packed and the bartender always made great drinks however , never a towel to be found after 10:30 am overall , the place is cozy and the grounds are beautiful and clean , but this place does not know how to make vacationers relax and be happy , too many ridiculous policies that need to be changed and with a little tweeking it could really be excellent 
heaven on earth my husband and i have been to punta cana 5 times this resort was one of the best the only draw back we found was that there was no buffet for dinner we found you had eat a big meal every time except for breakfast do to the fact that there was a buffet our stay was for 10 days the staff at this resort was exceptional and i can only name a few isabel and franklin from entertainment were two fine examples of hard working and pleasant to be around young adults that we have met we looked forward to seeing them everyday the other staff that i would like to mention are the boys that serve in the spice restaurant ( we ate diner there 5 times ) what an amazing group of young men they cannot do enough for us , always curteous and always smiing we have two boys of our own and i told my husband that could have taken these boys home with us it was a privilege to be waited on by these boys the hostesses in all of the restaurants are very pleasant and a delight to see daily i could go on but i wont 
excellent vacation well , my husband and i and another couple returned from excellence on apr 9, what a beautiful resort the grounds are beautiful as well as the rooms as stated in other reviews the beach is nice and the waves are a lot fun to play in we wanted some rr and that?? exactly what we got the main pool is where all the action is and great for socializing we found the food at the restaurants very good and really have no complaints the buffet had a huge variety as did all the menu items at the a la carte restaurants everyone in our party found something they liked on the menu without any difficulties during the days we mostly lounged around on the beach or pool everyday lunch was served at the beach at 12:30 pm or you were welcome to go to the buffet or they served sandwiches , pizza ( great ) , fruit etc , right to you at your beach chair without even asking there were definitely lots of umbrellas at the pool and beach to get shade if you needed it the weather was beautiful and only rained for about ? hour on our first day towards the end of the week it really got hot and we found that the pool was not refreshing anymore , but who?? complaining , the drinks were still refreshing last , but certainly not least was the service all the staff members were very eager to please we found the staff all spoke very good english and they all work very hard everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure you had everything you needed or wanted overall it was a fabulous vacation 
beautiful and we loved it lovely and spacious resort with stunning pool and gardens my only criticism concerns the occaisional blaring of overly loud and/or dumb music that really adds nothing to the resort - - especially before 9am 
except for the food this trip was for our honeymoon , and was eveything we could have asked for the landscaping was beautiful , and the staff was great anything we asked for was quickly taken care of the beach is very wavy , but i enjoy body boarding , so it was fine for me huge pool , but it closes at 6 p our room was very clean and the ac worked great be sure to check out the beach party avoid the casino , but they tell you that themselves so the food sucked for the most part we talked to people from other resorts , and they said the thing the french resteraunt was very good , but we did not try that untill our last night make this the place you eat most avoid the mexican/ dominican , and the burgers at the snack bar ( that was not beef ) besides eating , we could not stand the thought of leaving we even went on the marinarum tour , and although it was a blast , we could not wait to get back to our resort , one last thing the bus ride from the airport is every bit as terrifying as they say , my wife almost freaked , but i found it exciting would love to come back 
we could not of asked for a better stay my wife and i just got back this past weekend from 7 fantastic days at this beautiful resort i have never written on any such site before , but i read so many reviews to help me chose our destination that i felt it important to share this resort is as first class as you can get without paying crazy amounts of money it is true that it takes a little over an hour in an air - conditioned bus to get to the hotel , ( which bis only about 30mins more than the majority of places ) but when you get there and they hand you a cool cloth and a glass of cold champagne you will be so glad you picked this spot i could go on for pages about what was great , but the reality is the food is great , the staff are great , the rooms are great , the beach is great the pool is great on and on we were in heaven if i had to give a few negatives the currents are strong , so if you go for a swim in the ocean be careful not to get too far out , and if you are not a swimmer , stay close to shore i would also have to say that the adult only nature of this resort draws a nice crowd we met a few couples that honestly helped make this such a special time if you are thinking about this place if it is a couple extra bucks cheers from halifax 
perfect for romance my husband planned this surprise 10th anniversary trip to the excellence @ punta cana this was his first time planning a trip and i was a little nervous my fears subsided completely as we pulled up to the excellence it is a very well maintained and arranged resort it is extremely romantic and relaxing the crowd that was there was very laid back and relaxed as well - no rowdy college kids the staff was very professional and friendly despite the fact that we saw them working primarily all day the junior oceanview suite was perfect the food was good and there was a lot of selection the beachfront lunches were delicious the nightly entertainment was also very professional and good the beach was pretty rough all 5 days that we were there but the pool was very relaxing all in all , the excellence punta cana is a haven i have never been so relaxed i have never written a review but my stay was so enjoyable i just wanted to share 
a very nice resort we travelled from march 24-31 i got great value out of reading other reviews posted on this site so i thought i 'd better do the same just the facts : resort - immaculate the staff are constantly working to upgrade the place and keep it clean they we also very repectful of the guests when they were doing any work arounfdthe pool they actually surround themselves with a wood work area to keep the debris and noise down for the guests service - with few exceptions very good the staff work extremely long hours ( same server at breakfast was at the show at 11pm the same night ) and in the heat all day so given time i would not move at top speed either food - good favourite restuarants were the lobster house and chez isabelle although we did not have a bad meal anywhere we went i got sick for one day but was pretty adventurous with trying some of the local fare so that might have had something to do with it my wife was fine great buffet breakfast eveyday including fruit smoothies and omlettes food is also served by the pool by the staff at the lunch hour hot dogs , hamburgers , pizza ( delicious ) and nachos if you did not want to leave the pool to go one of the resturants maid service - excellent twice daily which was nice since we often need towels in the evening to clean up for dinner mini bar service - we were excellence club members and this wasa nice surprise mini bar included v8, red bull , gatorade , water , pop , bud , bud light and two kinds of the local beer presidente also you would get the odd chocolate bar thrown in this was refreshed everyday if there was some things you would like more of we just left a note and a couple greenbacks and it was accomodated everytime no expected at all but very much appreciated made no difference in the level of service we experienced rooms - everything was fine we requested an upper floor room but was given a swim up room we were right next store to the excellence club lounge which was nice ( room 10001) to duck in to use the computers or an afternoon snack we paid for ocean view which it was but you really ca not see much from the first floor because of the trees and pool cabanas etc still a nice room and very close to the pool to access the room throughout the day not my thing and from what i saw they were ok recommendations : pay the extra for the excellence club , particularily if you have a late check out the extra perks and better situated rooms are and we did not leave the resort until 5:30pm we were able to stay in our room until we left for no extra charge ( $10 per hour otherwise ) the private concierge was also nice good game of beach volleyball everyday at 11am the self serve soft serve ice cream by the kafe bar a nice afternoon snack we did not discover this until 3 days before we left notablesyou are a long way from everywhere at this resort so we opted out of any excursions too much travel time takes away time from the magnificent resort there was some concern over the surf before we left not an issue use common sense and you 'll be fine calmer areas of the ocean can be found just off the resort property the staff also keep a close eye to anyone in the water we would go back for some r  r anytime 
beautiful resort - but we based our choice on which resort to stay at based on other reviews we had read from previous tripadvisors and i must say that most people were right on the money we stayed at excellence from march 24th - 31st 2007the resort is absolutely beautiful and is kept immaculate by a very hard working staff i 've never stayed anywhere where a staff worked as hard as the employees at excellence , punta cana i know other reviewers singled out certain staff members , but i prefer to simply applaud them all one drawback for my husband and myself was the very strict dress code at evening restaurants we do not go on vacation in order to dress up every night to eat we prefer a more laid back atmosphere where shorts are allowed ( with a shirt with a collar my husband looks better than some men who were allowed in restaurants with torn/dirty jeans ) you also need to know that the dress code also applys to the martini bar located inside the lobby we found it very difficult to get served the resort could also add some much needed barstools to the bar since it runs almost the entire length of the room and only seats approx we stayed in room 7207 and had wonderful views of both the ocean and the pool the maid service was outstanding we never had to wait long to get our room cleaned for the day great bed , we had no problem sleeping at all and the jackuzi in the room was awesome you would be well served to reserve your favorite palapa or pool lounger  floatie early in the am at first it seemed like there were plenty for everyone , but we quickly found out that people put their towels on pool lounges and a palapa and also a beach hut the food was definitely not what we are used to getting in the us , but hey open your eyes and look around at what the dominicans eat every day and count your blessings that you live in the usa we opted for room service ( which is available all the time ) for 99% of our meals simply because of the dress code i could rave on and on about the room service meals , they were excellente try the fettucini alfredo it 's awesome as is the turkey sandwich and the burger our meals were delivered very hot and always sooner than the time alloted when ordered we enjoyed dining on our balcony at night the beach is beautiful and well maintained there is a tremendous undertow due to the high winds that blow constantly the red flags were up our entire stay we did go in the water , but if you are not used to the conditions you could be in trouble while they do not have a lifeguard there is someone on the beach who will blow the whistle if he thinks you are out too far from the shore there are no wave runners , parasailing or fly by advertising airplanes to ruin an otherwise peaceful day it 's not the place to go if you are looking for lots of action things to do while i did take some repellant , i only saw one mosquito the whole time i was there , but once i got home i 'm covered in mosquito bites so be wary of them overall , a very good experience if you are willing to dress up for dinner you will have an exceptional vacation at excellence punta cana 
decent gorgeous sunrise and sunsets be sure to take advantage of those times as you will have the entire outside to yourself and staff were great was below average stick with chicken 
good first all inclusive experience this was our first all inclusive hotel experience i have to say as the first experience it was well worth the money initially when you get off the airplane you see a beatiful out door airport and palm trees , my favorite part of the caribbean through our booking agent we had a hotel transfer which at the airport it is slightly overwhelming because there are individuals who basically grab your bags out of your hands to carry them for you although this is a nice welcome into punta cana , i found it slightly abrasive the ride to the hotel was about 1 5 hours due to us dropping off other guests at other hotels it was very bumpy and there was a lot of unorganized traffic upon arrival to the hotel , we saw this beautiful hotel and landscape we were very excited to begin our stay we got out the of taxi and were greeted by the valets who were extremely friendly and we were also greeted with a glass of champagne for each of us we then were escorted the the exclusive excellence club where we had the pleasure of meeting jacqueline and miguel they were very helpful throughout the week and made our stay very relaxing our room was gorgeous we were in building seven on the top floor we had two balconies and a private jacuzzi tub as well our view was the ocean and the swim up pool bar maid service - was ok we were supposed to receive a paper every morning and we did not we were supposed to have fresh fruit in our room everyday and we never did the maid did come in and clean our room each day , only thoroughly if we put the sign in the door the maid also came in and did a turn down service each night , some nights we had a copy of the excellence news while others we did not so it was inconsistent food - ok best restaurants barcelona , agave , and the grill dress code is a little ridiculous men have to wear long pants , but that means some were in sweat pants or in jeans with ratty sneakers and t - shirts while those who had on nice shorts , shirts , and shoes were sent back to their room to change entertainment team - - what can i say , these people make the experience every night there was a show which was always fun to watch each afternoon when we would get rain showers , they were there with games and bingo needless to say we were never bored francisco , juan miguel and the rest of the entertainment team created a fun environment for all service - in some of the restaurants the servers were slow in agave , they were quick to greet , bring our food , and fill our drinks the cocktail waitresses were always walking around asking if we needed anything sanller in the pool bar is always smiling victor and santos in the excellence club were also always a pleasure to have conversations with and provided great service shopping - at the resort , one word , over priced i paid $12 for a bottle of tums 100ct word to the wise , it would be beneficial to polish up your spanish to visit the island , not just the resorts 
a beautiful and elegant resort for couples , but problems w/ excellent club we had a great time at this beautiful and elegant couples resort which had lots of shade and huts by the pool as well as by the beach there are also beds with huts at the pool - never saw anything like this before this is an amazing place , but we did have problems with the excellence club and with prieto tours : excellence clubbeware that what is advertised in the literature about the excellence club does not really exist you will have a lounge with daily hot and cold snacks which is open until 11 p there are only two computers in there and you will most likely have to wait on line the pillow menu , upgraded toilet articles in your room , daily fruit platter , uprgraded room service menu , private beach and towels in your room is not true ocassionally , they may bring you a fruit platter and do give you a flower arrangement when you arrive everything else is a gimic including the late checkout your room will not necessarily be in a better location the club usually use 7,8 and 10 - but we were put in building 14 if you go with a non excellence club swim out junior suite , ask not to be put in buildings 1, 2 or 4 since they are in a separate section of the resort with a pool disconnected to the main winding one in summary , if you want to get your money 's worth , you have to constantly pester them you do really get upgraded liquor in the room if this is important to you prieto toursthis is the tour company you will get if you booked your trip through liberty travel or american airlines vacations we found them to be very inconsiderate we did not know about their orientation and they would not invite us to another one on the way back to the airport , our van driver went all the way back to one of the hotels taking us an hour out of our way saying he had to pick up another couple - who never even showed up this should not be allowed by the company since the hour and 15 min ride is long enough to and from the airport in punta cana also be careful at the airport when you arrive several men will pretend that they are the tour company and start walking your luggage to the desk expecting a tip when they have nothing to do with the company if you look at their shirts , you will see that they are from a different company resort and room locationseverything is very spread out if you want to be right near the swim up bar , you 'd want to be in building 6 or 7 if you want peace and quiet and do not mind walking a lot , building 14 was a long walk , but had a beautiful view and the pool view was great here all of the activities around the pool take place in the plaza area which is closest to building 6 the staff are very nice and friendly we took spanish lessons offered each morning at 10:30 a with franklin who is very personable and works very hard trying to make guests feel comfortable general infothe food was okay - but although there are 7 restaurants , they are not all opened every night and there is none with a dinner buffet horseback riding is free , so beware of anyone at the pool trying to sell you this for $35 hour this is a different tour and they are people from outside the resort also beware of the vendors in the courtyard in the evening who are like vultures trying to get you to buy their beaded jewelry the internet cafe ( non excellence club ) is very far away from the rooms , so good to know it also costs $5 for every 20 minutes the couples here are all diffferent ages we are 42 and 46, but there were many older than us here this really is a magnificent and beautiful place , but wish we had known all of the above in advance overall , this was one of the nicest all inclusives that we have ever been to and punta cana is beautiful 
" great beach " visited excellence dr from march 9th - 16th the resort is kept impeccably clean and the beach is gorgeous the only real downfall of the resort is the food having traveled to many upper end all - inclusives , this fell below the average even though the food was palatable , it did not make you want more a couple of very important suggestions while at the resort do not wonder off the grounds in the early evening or at night one couple got mugged 15 feet off the grounds going left facing the ocean one of them was a london police officer they do have guards posted at night on both ends of the resorts with rifles if you need something , go directly to the consierge calling from your room or talking with the front desk did not work we called for two days to get an iron and one day to fix a plumbing issue it would have never been fixed if we did not make a personal visit to the consierge who had it taken care of it immediately excellence management is working very hard to improve from a 4 to a 5 again , but it needs to start with the quality in the kitchens 
excellente all the way my husband  i stayed at the excellence punta cana from march 1-7, 2007 warning : this is going to be a long review i am very long - winded too much to talk about this was a much anticipated vacation and leading up to the trip - i checked trip advisor every day for tips on what to pack and what to expect for our trip i simply knew that this place would be awesome seeing that there were two bad reviews out of hundreds oh well - you ca not please everyone one thing that i should 've listened to is to bring at least a 45 sunblock my skin actually could 've used about an 80 spf ( if there is such a thing we 've been back for nearly two weeks and my tan is just now setting in nothing but pain for the last two days of my trip and the past two weeks for those that want to come back with sun - kissed skin take my advise and use lots of sunscreen you might feel silly being the goofball with white lotion all over but believe me - the sun will get you bronzed no matter what you use it shined throughout our entire stay - only rained in the early evening for 10-15 minutes as we were showering for dinner my vacation was fantastic but would 've been much better had i brought a good sunscreen anyway - back to the trip when we arrived in punta cana via u we stepped off the place ( with our jackets and coats fresh from oh where it was 22 degrees ) into sunshine and at least 84 degree heat after passing through customs we had our transportation to the hotel already taken care of through our travel agency but beware of the 50 or so airport employees in the lobby waiting to carry your luggage nothing to fret about one gentleman ended up leading us in the right direction and ended up making a buck or two to carry our luggage to the van we were on our van in 15 minutes tops and waited about 5-7 minutes for another couple to load up the driver turned on the air for us and made small talk as we waited i guess i had an advantage because my husband is fluent in spanish - but the airport employees knew enough english to get by we rode in the air conditioned van for about an hour and 10 minutes until we arrived at the excellence punta cana i actually enjoyed the ride yes - it was a little bumpy at times but i 've been to guatemala and mexico  traveled pretty extensively throughout both of those places so just take it all in and enjoy the view throughout the ride you would find about 10-12 guys manually working on the roads in different spots ( improving them ) and soooo much construction everywhere this place will be like new york city in a few years if all of the new construction keeps up when we finally arrived at the excellence the gate opened up and the gardens were beautiful i was so excited to get into my suit and hit the beach as we checked in - ourselves and the other couple ( from charlotte , nc ) were greeted with glasses of champagne mine was gone in about 2 minutes matias checked us in and tried to talk us into the upgrading to the excellence club good try , though i was not paying $600 plus to upgrade to premium beverages and free internet we booked a junior gardenview suite and that 's exactly what we got ( although we did try to talk him into upgrading us to pool or ocean view ) it did not work he gave us our keys and we were on our way ( to building 9) he was very friendly and outgoing , considering what happened next to make an extremely long story short we treaded past the pool view rooms to the very back of the property and up to the 3rd floor ( the elevator was not in service ) to room 9206 , the view was not good at all ( a scummy pond in fact ) with no fish , flowers , nada i was a little disappointed but figured we 'd make the most out of it we needed the exercise , anyway we tipped the gentleman that brought our luggage ( all the way up the stairs i might add ) by the time we arrived into our room we changed into our suits and started unpacking and getting settled in when we realized our air conditioner ( or safe ) was not working after a call down to the desk matias sent two gentleman arrived to look at the air ( did not jot down their names but they were very friendly ) - and determined that it was in fact out of service we called back down to the front desk and let them know that we needed to move to another room right away and matias let us know that he would call us right back we waited and waited and after about 30-40 minutes of just sitting and waiting my husband finally got frustrated and called the front desk back i supposed that lit a fire under their butts and they told us to go to our new room (4208) and they would have our luggage arriving over there shortly shortly in dominican republic usually means within 2-3 hours we made the walk all the way to building 4 in our suits ( although we still had not hit the pool or beach ) - and things were definitely starting to look up we passed the waterfall pool and all of the beautiful gardens , the wedding gazebo , and many friendly employees along the way ( always smiling i might add 
the dreaded drive ? after reading all the reviews about the drive to and from the hotel i was a little nervous because i often get carsick however , i didn?? think it was that bad the only thing is driving there can be a little long especially because you drop other groups off within the first half hour and then it takes them another 40min to get to excellence there are a ton of potholes on the road but the drivers know all of them and just maneuver around them just prepare yourself and know it 's worth the wait you also get to see how great excellence is in comparison absolutely beautiful with the rabbits , parrots , flamingos , and chickens you can see all the time they put into keeping excellence beautiful the entrance and all the foliage were well kept everything was super clean spa - never tried it but we walked in and it was very relaxing the gym is nothing great but if you must workout they go the basics pool - the swimming pool was very nice with a huge swim - up bar the only thing i would recommend is picking out some good sitting around 9am or so people can be pretty rude about saving multiple seats if you wake up late enough you will notice towels unrolled all over the place but nobody actually laying down if you aren?? picky then it doesn?? matter but if you want some shade it?? a must i went to puerto plata last year and i was majorly disappointed with the beach this beach was the complete opposite it was clean with nice soft sand the water can be a little rough but nothing to worry about they have beds you can lay down on the far left side you will notice a ton of beach activities if you want drinks delivered to you sit near the bars also tip the ladies who bring you the drinks all the employees from excellence were so well trained and willing to help with anything i loved every single one of them when you get there you will notice how much they care danny , victor , and jenny were the best mudslide , banana mama , strawberry daiquiri , coco loco ? all so deliciousfood ? the mexican place ( agave ) do not recommend the only thing i liked about agave was the band the french place ( chez isabelle ) also pretty disappointed especially since everyone raved about it the asian cuisine place ( spice ) probably my favorite the food was really good and danny was awesome ask him what to get and he tells you the good stuff the grill was actually pretty good too and there is no curve ball you pretty much get what you ask for its just good burgers , salads , etc the lobster house was good just know that it only serves lobster the italian place we were told by other couples to avoid as much as possible several people actually got up in the middle of their meal and left it was so bad the room service was seriously great it was funny because we often felt as though the room service food was a lot better than the restaurant food we went to the italian place for bfast the first morning because it?? all buffet style but it was pretty gross so the following day we ordered room service and it was 100 times better all around , everything is served in small portions so make sure you get an appetizer when it comes to tipping we did it often we tipped the driver , the bartenders , room service , cleaning lady , and waitors just leave a few bucks and they really appreciate it it 's not a must but if you do they will definitely take care of you 
good vacation my husband surprised me with tickets to excellence punta cana for my birthday and we stayed from feb 23-27th overall , it was definitely relaxing and fun you just have to really remember that 5 star quality in other parts of the world is very different than amrerican 5 stars check in : when we arrived to the property it was definitely appealing before we arrived to excellence , we dropped off a couple in majestic and surprisingly , that hotel was not very appealing when you first drive up to it so i was happy to see that excellence was pretty as soon as we got out of the car , we already had the bellman at our feet taking our bags which was great when we walked up the desk , we got a nice wet cold towel and champagne check in was very fast and simple rooms : ok so the rooms are def not 5 star quality but we expected that it would not be it was sort of dark no smell or mildew but sticky but ofcourse you are in the carribbean so you expect it besides , , , we are only in the room to sleep the bed was obviously cheap and hard but we had no problem sleeping towels were not always stocked but whenever we found the maid , she was always pleasant and gave us towels tv has a good selection of channels as well but no inroom movies food : the food was ok i liked the italian restaurant trattoria and i def like the breakfast buffet in the morning and the plated breakfast at the lobster house we ate at spice ( asian ) and my food was ok , , , but my husband hated his food which was strange considering he is not picky at all the grill was pretty good ( get shrimp cockail , , it is to die for barcelona was horrible the food was cold and not tasty at all there were 3 other couples in the restaurant and they were complaining as well how the food was cold and not good the french restaurant was most disappointing i read reviews of how wonderful it is but it reallly is not , , , every night there was an hour/half wait but i think that it is just to hype up the place because when it was finally our turn to go , , , we saw many tables empty the waiters are nice and they brought out a cake and sang happy birthday , , , very sweet but the food , , , dont waste your time for the wait the best food overall in the resort was the fresh pizza during lunch manny the pizza guy would make the pizzas himself and deliver outside the pool area realllllly nice guy and awesome pizza pool : pretty good i wouldnt say it was spectacular , , , but the swim up bar is always great the beds around the pool are also a nice touch , , , the only negative , , , the water was way too cold beach : ok this is the reason i come to the caribbean i want that beautiful blue water and white sand well the sand is def brown but its verrrry soft the beach is huge and even if the sand was brown , , , it was still surprisingly pretty the water is def verrry rough im not a strong swimmer but it was a lot of fun i def went under a few times and the undertow def took my top off a couple of times the water is a nice blue but because it is rough , , , its hard to tell if you want that nice leisure crystal clear water , , , just walk a couple hundred feet to the right , , , and you will find it location : it is def secluded which is nice but when it was rainy it was a bit boring because you cant exactly leave the resort becauese everything is an hour/half away i would have liked to be able to go into a city overall : i have been to many places in the carribean punta cana is very nice and the hotel was overall nice i wouldnt say it was the best place i 've been to and i dont know if i would come back but it is def worth checking out 
jury is out our second visit stayed in the vip area in a suite food , service staff , views ( night and day ) , beach , entertainment , all adults , bars , workout area , pool , and room oscar night on the beach was over the top had three sightings of rats , once during the day and twice at night reported this to management and they acknowledged the issue and were dealing with it keep in mind that this resort is under new management the 50 minute trip from the airport was not fun 
you wo not be sorry we spent 4 nights at excellence from 2/23 to 2/27 this was our first visit to this hotel and our first visit to the dominican republic ride : the ride was about an hour it was no big deal but then again we have travelled in jamaica so nothing much fazes us any more i did not think it was terrible but there were quite a few potholes resort : very clean and well kept the grounds are beautiful and we could see how hard everyone worked keeping it clean and keeping the landscape so beautiful everything is laid out very nicely no problem with mosquitos beach : beautiful it is not the calm carribean , you are on the atlantic ocean and there were some rough waves and some undertow and riptides we had fun splashing around everyday and wave surfing lots of chairs available and the beach service was excellent our drinks never went dry and the servicer was always very pleasant room : we had a swim out room over the cascade pool we loved this feature the room was comfortable and clean but it did have a strong musty smell the first time we walked in but i never noticed it again so i ca not say whether it went away because of the air - conditioning or if we just got used to it the slider did not work properly and the screen was ripped but other than that everything else was fine housekeeping : this was the one very disappointing part of our stay while the room was always cleaned we were missing wash clothes most days , one day we had to call at 5:30 and request a room cleaning , another time they did not leave soap and we were out , never left new shampoo or conditioner after the old was used we also never once got the evening turn down service on the plus side , mini bar was always stocked and we always had fresh water food : breakfast was the standard buffet you will find in most ai for lunch we usually went to the grill or one day they had a beach bar - b - que , which was really cool with burgers , chicken and ribs dinner we ate at the lobster house one night it was very good but it does only serve lobster hubby told our waiter he was not eating and they told him they would bring him a beef dish so if you ask they will accomadate we also ate at chez isabelle and that was very good excellent service , except i never got my after dinner coffee toscana was also very good and we tried spice one night - they were out of 2 or the 3 appetizers but everything was very good and our waiter enrique was excellent but again , did not get my after dinner coffee pool : we really only used the cascade pool it was very quiet the big pool looked very well kept but we are beach people so we only used the pool at the end of the day for about 1/2 or so not huge drinkers my husband loved the local beer ( presidente ) and all our mixed drinks were very good i always had cabernet with dinner and the wine was pretty good other guests : this was our big suprise the crowd was older than we expected this means nothing but we have been to other adult ai and usually the average age ran from honeymooners to 70+ with an average age of 30 or 40 there were more people in the 40-50 and quite a bit of 60 than there were younger adults all the guests were pleasant and there seemed to be a good mix of european and united states entertainment : we saw 3 shows and all were very good we especially liked the sax and piano player before dinner great way to entertain the guests after dinner and before the evening show tipping : we did tip everyone from housekeeping to bar to wait staff ca not say it improved our service , everyone whether they tipped or not got the same service and it sure did not help with housekeeping gift shop : there are several small one on the resort we ran out of toothpaste and bought a $6 00 4 oz tube and our spray sunscreen ran out and that was $18 for a small bottle i thought all the prices were high compared to other resorts we have been to but they were well stocked anyone going to excellence will have a great time the resort is well run and for the most part service was great i rated it above average not excellent since the housekeepng really needs to be worked on , we never got the promised evening service and the slider should have been repaired it is one of the higher priced resorts and for that we should not have continuing housekeeping problems or a slider door in need of repair overall , it was a very nice resort , with good food , good service and a beautiful setting 
fantastic i stayed at excellence punta cana for part of february vacation , and now i realize that five days is not enough the resort was fantastic it was very clean , the staff was friendly , and the drinks were plentiful i highly recommend the coco loco , which is served in a coconut overall , the food was good , and i consider myself to be a picky eater the lobster place was my favorite i spent most of my time sitting by the pool ( the ocean was a bit rough for my taste ) or lounging around inside if it was raining i did not take advantage of the horseback riding or the bike tour , but i heard that both were fun i do recommend leaving the property and going out into the plaza if you have time the shops had some fun souvenirs , and you can haggle with the vendors , which was a lot of fun the only downside to leaving the property is that you have to take a taxi , which cost $35 each way you do get a better idea of what the country is like from the taxi ride , though my only complaint would be that there was not much of a night life the michael jackson show was the best show that they had the disco was fun , especially because there was staff on hand to get everyone dancing ( you could take dance lessons in the afternoons ) also , i went on vacation with a friend , and when we arrived , it was obvious that this resort catered mainly to couples , which is not how it was advertized on the website we had a hard time getting a room with two beds , but nicolas was extremely helpful in the situation emilio , the concierge , was also friendly and informative , and of the entertainment crew , isael was the best 
extremely disapointing this resort excellence had once been part of the secrets brand hotel chainwe were never told they left secrets and was under new management it was no longer a secrets and it became very obvious early on there were some issues expecting a similar experience and amentities we have enjoyed at secrets in mexico , we were shocked and very disapointed in this resortthe food was absolutely uneadible , there were plenty of choices and oppotunity to find food , but if you want or need better than bland pizza on baked off frozen crust or large burgers grilled and staked high on a steam table you would be out of luck the so called ala carte restaurants were bizarre , seldom did we get what we actually ordered , and when our entree arrived , they were either overcooked or swimming in grease all in clusive wine and beer choices consisted of 1 of each , presedente draft beer only and low end concho y toro chilian jug wine i ordered a vodka on the rocks , but it had a funky taste , like the glass had not been cleaned properly i do not want to go on an entire rant here , so the next are fast facts housekeeping was horrible no robes no dvd player , no coffe maker no turndown or any of the cute little extras outlined in the brochure we moved twice because of noise they charged us $300 for an upgrade , when all we wanted was a quiter room the beach was beautiful the pools were cleaneverything else was disappointing at the excellence punta cana in nov 2006 
and should be 'excellent ' very soon stayed from 10th - 26 january 2005grounds and gardens - supurb with interesting plants which were overgrown , but the new management are working hard to make them immaculate small lakes  ponds with friendly animals , rabbits , flamingos , peacocks and the 'cheeky ' two parrots they love peanuts , but also like glasses , buttons  hair bobbles so beware the wreckers buildings  rooms - clean , but need painting lifts do not work so if you are on the third floor , be prepared to climb stairs , often several times a day , because the room cards to open your door do not work sometimes our original room disappointing , it was dowdy and not equipt as brochure given new room with upgraded mini bar  dvd iron  ironing board are behind the left hand curtain comfy bed , but turn down service  fresh towels in the evening only available if you tip the maid every day the standard of the seating area was very poor and uncomfortably also , did not like the open plan bathroom / bedroom my husband  i are very close , but we also like a bit of space i usually spend some time before going out , relaxing in the tub , doing my hair , make up etc and come out looking radient my husband likes to watch tv and 'chill ' but with the hairdryer on it was not easy no privacy , but he has some interesting photographs management note , a small drape or pull down screen would sort this also as there is no where to dry wet swimwear , a pull - out line would be handy across the bath or drier on balcony restaurants and service - the choice and quality of food in all the eating places was very good supurb 'nouvelle cuisine ' in the al a cartes excellent barbeques  buffets on the beach and round the pool fantastic settings with unusual wood fires huge logistical task for staff you created a great atmosphere downside to eating - at breakfast , lunch and dinner , the food was often served 'luke ' warm - cool not good , and some people did complain about tummy problems making toast was a disaster always a long queue but the english tea was always very hot the service and comunications with staff in the restaurants was excellent everybody was genuinly happy to help you tips were appreciated , but not expected entertainment - the team were adequate and did the usual caribean daytime programmes their equipment was worn out , but you made the best of it , joined in and had fun the same applied to the evening entertainment also , as many people are there for two weeks , there should be more on to entertain them there was one band every night with the same tunes not enough variety people were playing bingo for something to do sport - my husband likes to windsurf , sail and snorkle i like to go on canoe or pedalo we did all this at sunscape ( 1 mile up the beach ) but there are no watersports here the sea is so rough it is dangerous to swim in , because of the undercurrent saw several people rescued only a few yards out pool area - large choice of shaddy or sunny areas , but the beds and tables were dirty the mats are left out all night , so if it rains , they get wet the towels are rolled up on them , so they get wet as well this needs sorting out another very annoying thing , is the selfish people who think that the rafts / floats belong to them they put them next to or under their beds and hoard them all day , using them very rarely management should put note up saying that the rafts are for everybodies pleasure and should be left in the water tennis - we took racquets but could not get on a court from 5 - 7pm because the coach books it out for himself too hot the rest of the day other court both net and surface full of holes sports bar - all the equipment and games were completly worn out huge gouges in the the pool tables and the table tennis table was hardly usable etcurgent action required here management also , this is where you tend to get bitten by the mossies , so spray up before you go here to watch the sport on tv excellence club had a private lounge with an all day mini buffet , and free internet access also , a larger variety of ( serve yourself ) spirits on the whole , very good hotel which should improve greatly over the coming months under the new management 
our trip to the " fake " secrets we have taken many all - inclusive trips in the past and have never been so disappointed with our trip to secrets this time , we opted to take the 6 golden apple square deal for three nights we were placed at secrets and were very excited when we found out at the airport because last year we stayed at secrets capri in the mayan and absolutely loved it and rated it one of the best resorts where we ever stayed we have stayed at other 6 golden apple resorts previously and this resort does not meet 6 golden apple standards in our eyes the facilities and grounds were adequate , but the service standards and food presentation and quality at this resort were not acceptable every employee at the restaurants and bars seemed to have too much work we chose to eat at the japanese restaurant the first night of our stay the hostess put our name on the wait list and told us to come back in 30 minutes when we came back one half hour later , no table was yet available and we were told that the restaurant was too busy and we would be better off going to another restaurant the hostess also said the seafood restaurant did not have a wait , so we decided to try the seafood restaurant we were greatly disappointed in our meal at this restaurant as it did not make a very good first impression of special dinners we had so looked forward to enjoying the food at the seafood restaurant was precooked and stored in heating trays the selection was very disappointing because seafood was not even on the menu our only choices were various fish fillets seafood such as lobster and shrimp was on the menu at secrets capri in the mayan riviera the quality of the food was also not to our expectations some of the food was cold and the fish had a bad taste we were also disappointed that the salads and desserts were on a bar that was self - serve every dinner at secrets capri was completely a sit - down meal the service at this restaurant was slow and very impersonal there were only 3-4 couples eating while we were there so service should have been more attentive , it seemed like the staff was more concerned with cleaning up than providing exceptional service our second night we ate at the bourdeau gourmet restaurant in the resort we were very happy that they gave pagers out so we did not have to keep walking back to the restaurant from the lobby bar to see if a room was available as we had done the night before we thought the use of pagers would have been standard like they were at all restaurants at secrets capri the food at bordeaux was acceptable and the atmosphere more enjoyable so , based on that and the opinions of other guests we had spoken too , we decided to eat at this restaurant the last two nights of our stay rather than try another and be disappointed again although the food and service were much better and this restaurant we were still frustrated by the long wait to be seated each night the first night we waited 1 hour and the next night we waited 1 hour and 20 minutes lunches could also be disappointing i ordered a tuna sandwich for lunch at the seafood restaurant and could not find the tuna most days , we just ate whatever was being grilled on the beach the lunch in the buffet upon our arrival was probably the best meal of our stay bar service also did not seem to be up to the standards we expected of secrets resorts drinks seemed at times very difficult to order than when you ordered a drink the bartender never once served me a second drink without a wait and me having to ask for it when we stayed at secrets capri i never had to ask for a second drink and drink orders were served quickly there were numerous bartenders at each bar there rather than the 1-2 at each bar at secrets in punta cana we had to wait at times for 10 or 15 minutes before being served , particularly when first arriving at the bar the drinks at the main pool swim - up bar were served in cheap disposable plastic cups and an employee would push around a large trash can to collect the cups at secrets capri drinks were served in fancy plastic reusable cups that were shaped like regular hurricane or margarita glasses needless to say , we felt service around the pool at secrets excellence in punta cana was poor food service was even available around the pool at secrets capri no food options were to be found at the pool areas at secrets excellence , except hard , dried out fried foods that sat out all day and which you had to go get yourself and the very far end of the lagoon style pool we were also disappointed with the atmosphere of the restaurants one large room served as the buffet , italian and japanese restaurant these areas were only separated by partial walls or partitions needless to say , this did not appear very intimate or romantic noise from one area tended to drift to the others the restaurants at secrets capri had separate buildings with d?cor and facilities to match the specific theme of each restaurant they were much more enjoyable experiences there were also several little things that we found different from secrets capri , but when lumped together they just added to our disappointment with this resort the pool towels were small and several of the pool chairs and cushions were very worn and should have been thrown away we were not given towel cards at check in , and had to walk several minutes back to the front desk before going to the pool after we tried to obtain towels from the towel hut the young lady at the towel hut was not very customer friendly when we explained that we were not issued cards and hadn?? expected to because they were not given out at secrets capri this young lady often was not at her station when we would come to get or turn in towels she tended to hang out at the snack bar instead only when she noticed us trying to take care of our needs ourselves would she run over and do her job the safe locked us out two times during out stay and we were told that the security guard would change the battery , but he never did unfortunately , this trip did not live up to our expectations we have even come to have called this trip our ??ake secrets vacation? because the difference between the quality and service at these two resorts were so remarkable we hope that when the new secrets resort in the dominican is built that secrets capri is the model i do not think we would have been as dissatisfied if we had not been to another secrets resort it is no wonder it is changing management only time will tell if they can do better the secrets chain and amstar resorts have lost some credibility in our eyes following this vacation and have us wondering if we will chose these resorts again 
horrific - do not go we stayed at the excellence punta cana from dec 30, 2006 - jan 6, 2007 and our experience was terrible we were very disappointed since we did our homework and read good things about the resort first off the food was so bad it you barley eat it , on new year 's eve they had a special menu with two main choices we ordered the seafood tower appetizer and i was crunching on shells the veal i was served was a complete piece of fat , no meat or anything resembling veal the breakfast buffet had cheeses and meat that stood out all morning without refrigeration and the cheese actually had mold growing on it i was also served decaf coffee by the waitress but she handed me a nescafe bottle  water and said to make it myself a 5 star resort does not have you make your own coffee also very annoying was the fact they changed the daily schedule several times each day you could not count on the execellence times paper to provide accurate info on events and restaurant closures other horrible things : ice maker in our building never worked , we lost our power in the room at night and it took 45 mins for someone to respond , our room was not cleaned until 5:30 pm , the elevators do not work , wake up call was 1/2 hr late , some staff  almost all management were rude and could care less about troubles , our scheduled horseback riding never took place due to the resort changing the times several times we were unable to relax since each day a new annoyance would occur , that was the first time that i could not wait for my vacation to end do not go to excellence punta cana 
hotel in transition as a repeat visitor ( last year same time 12/26- 1 /2) my wife and i were not made aware of the change in ownership of this property taking place during our stay december 31 , 2006 marked , out with secrets and in with excellence but i would return for sure , let me explain the tone of the staff for the first 6 days at secrets was one of uncertainty and for those of us that have lived and or worked though a takeover in a company , you know what i mean i certainly empathized with the staff although when you are paying top $ and you are on holiday the last thing i need is a disgruntled employee not engaged did i mention the food / bad imagine if you are bailing and the owner , would you invest in the clients , staff , facialties , customer expierence but here is the catch and why i would go back the property is fabulous , the beach although rough ( waves ) is great , the new owners from spain , swooped at midnight on the 31st and by morning the transition team had converted all seven resturants to new names ( signs ) , eliminated all branding of secrets and changed the large signs on the front of the property by day watching this team ( appeared like 30 members on the team ) was amazing and they did not stop in the morning , in fact the group was excited to get in and start the changeover prioritizing the must dos first this propert y is spectacular and our immediate goal is to make a difference everyday , in 3 months the hotel will be on its way to becomig a mazzarotti ( sp ) vs a volkswagon these guys are serious , have a plan and the resourses to execute the smiles of the staff re - appeared magically and immediatley life seemed , calming once again anyway i wanted to clairify that the quality of this secrets vacation was not worth the money we paid this year and only regret we could not enjoy the changes the new owners are planning if the first day as an example , they not only changing the names of resturants but also the menus the first meal severd in the barcelona was 9/10 we have friends that want to expierece this place and they are going feb , 2007 and i await their comments i think i know the answer the excellance club was worth the extra $ , internet / room service/ i believe the rooms through out the hotel are all very similar except for the views beach vs quiet pool the new mini bar is not mini johnny walker black , grey goose , ( full boottles ) red bull , various beers , snacks , very impressive entertainment , we loved it jazz , live shows , disco , non stop evening fun till 2/3 am settle back upon arrival one hour 15 minutes drive from the airport , the arranged mini bus was fine and had great ac summary : great secluded property , 7 a la carte dining expierences , no kids only wish the change over was , not a secret jctoronto , canada 
honest , detailed review we stayed at secrets punta cana from dec 25- jan 1st (06/07) and booked this on a whim via our travel agent there was a last minute deal being offered about a month prior and after we looked up the resort and saw it was a six golden apple - we could not wait this was not our first all - inclusive trip and definitely not our last however , it 'll be our last at secrets punta cana - and the domincan all together we 've been on numerous all - inclusives in addition to four cruises and found this resort to be the most beautiful , yet the most disappointing perhaps we went into this with high expectations considering the rating ( we 've been to four and five apples and were very satisfied , so we assumed this could only get better ) , but were not impressed we are a very laid back go - with - the - flow type of couple give us sun , drinks , and good food - we 're happy let us explain the room ( b+ ) beautiful no bugs and decent bed we upgraded when we got there and had no regrets whatsoever they supposedly known for trying to get you to upgrade and we 're usually not ones to do so we originally had a garden view and upgraded to a room w/ a swim out patio at the time of check - in they wanted $700 for the week , but we offered them $350 and they took it never take their first offer the resort ( a - ) big , beautiful and well - kept for the most part they only offer you a spanish map of the resort , so we had to basically find our way around on our own careful of your belongings as with anywhere you go out of the country , never leave then out of your site we were very careful but within the last three days , we had our cell phone stolen out of our bag ( which was at my side on the bar ) , a girl had her ipod stolen off her beach chair and a friend had his cell phone stolen out of the front pocket of his suitcase leaving the dominican everywhere i went i carried my camera , etc , but one time i looked away and it was gone the food ( c+ ) extremely disappointing i 'd have to say one out of every three people we talked to got sick granted it could 've been the water , but we never drank tap water thanks to trip advisor we were prewarned to bring pepto , b/c we used it bring it with you b/c they wanted $15 a bottle in the gift shop i do not know what it was about the food , but i had issues 5/7 days and my husband had it 2/7 no matter what i ate - i got sick - and i have never had that problem at any other resort restaurants : * mexican : great fajitas and quesadilla 's ( a ) * oceana : horrible - no matter what you ordered , they put the same orange sauce on everything ( d ) * borrdeaux : fantastic , although i got sick after every meal best restaurant at the resort ( a ) * italian ( c ) - good pizza* buffet ( breakfast and lunch ) - ( f ) - very unorganized order , food is hit or miss , do not eat the sausage good french fries w/ cheese at the outside burger joint this ended up being our lunch 4/7 days staffgotta agree w/ the past reviews we understand we 're out of the country , but the english was horrible they seemed to know the basics and what was on the menu should you have an emergency or lost something valuable - forget it they asked us to write our lost phone report on a piece of scrap paper : ) not many smiles spa was decent , but different i was left for about 20 minutes laying on my back during a facial w/no instructions as to when she 'd be back ( if ever you just felt very lost unless you spoke fluent spanish i personally felt like they hated americans we tipped almost everyone ( $10, etc at dinner ) and it made no difference i honestly felt they did not know the difference between a $1 and a $10 oh , and one more thing if you ask for a pina colada , etc - you had to specify with alcohol at times you 're at an adult resort - why do you need to ask for alcohol in your drink worst of all , they 'd have absolute etc on the shelf , but it was by no means absolute they pour their cheap stuff into the bottles making you think that 's what you 're getting i felt very deceived this was at almost all the bars for a six golden apple - i 'm expecting much better in regards to the quality of liquor they have bud light , but would only serve them to us 2 per person b/c they were 'saving them for later again , we 're go w/ the flow type of people , so take our opinion as you wish overall it was a relaxing vacation , but by no means met our expectations 
secrets punta cana not as it appears let me start off by stating that our stay at secrets was basedon promotional materials , travel agent and a freindsreccommendations our freinds stayed at the resort over a year ago , and obviously they had a better stay , in what musthave been a better resort ( at that time ) the resort has had some major changes in the last six months it is not a 5 or 6 apple resort as apple claims it is more of a 4at best although much of the core service staff remains , theyare overworked and stressed because of some changes theresort will be making ( pertaining to the staff ) in the near future the food is average at best be warned - - the beef , as best wecan tell , comes from argentina , and is not at all like us beef when you order a filet you will get something that is like a smallskirt steak the seafood resturant does not offer lobster orscallops the surf and turf is the odd beef and shrimp theother selections are very generic seafood beware of the sushiin the oriental resturant , it gets to the sushi bar in bus tubs all the food is flavorless , not at all what you would expect the top shelf liquor is inconsistant at each bar in some bars the stoli tastes like gilberts vodka , i ordered jim beam at a pool bar ( bourban ) and received whisky from a jim beam bottle ( i am not a whisky drinker so brand is unknown , but it tasted cheap ) the rooms are nice but ac is inconsistant make sure your room is cold when you arrive in case you need to switch the free wet bar frig never even got cold in our room we found that other guests has the same problem so we did not bother to report it something we did mention to hotel staff is the fact that two to three times a week the lobby becomes an open market the resort allows vendors to set up open air market tables , and sell there wares when on vacation i do not want to deal with aggressive local vendors if i want local wares i can find the market , i do not want to be accousted between dinner and my room the pool is great and a focal point of the resort , like in the apple brochure , the whole place looks great to sum this up you can spend the same or less and find a better place to spend vacation - - - - the brochure and apple materials are very attractive - - - - but it is not what it seems good luck , great vacationing 
secrets good my husband and i just got back from secrets the bus trip to the hotel was not bad we decided to upgrade to the excellence club was it worth the extra $500, i do not think so but my husband did the room was clean and the bed was ok we did see a few ants but nothing to complain about the pool and grounds were terrific entertainment was awesome and we truly enjoyed the disco every night the food was less desireable , after breakfast each day i had had stomach problems oceana  mexican was awful the italian was our favorite with japanese running a close second the food was always luke warm for some reason and the service at all the restaurants were mediocore they never smiled and seemed like they were forced to work there the service at the bar and pool was excellent i would recommend this hotel to others but they need to improve their service and food at the restaurants they teach spanish every morning to their guests but they should consider teaching english to their employees because this was a huge issue for me 
beautiful grounds and pool , the rest not the best we travel at least 2 times per year and this was our second all inclusive trip my husband and i went to secrets nov 19th -25th , we chose this resort because in march of 06 we were married at the secrets in riviera maya mexico and loved it i can say that secrets punta cana by far had the most beautiful grounds , our room was 10004 with a walkout and to the left you could see the ocean and hear it all day long , it was amazing the pool was great , there was always rafts around and no real issue with getting a chair anywhere around the resort the nature scene at the entrance of the resort had flamingos , ducks , parrots , peacocks and much more , it was beautiful the room was pretty comprable to mexico however believe it or not the smell was better than in mexico , we carried the smell around back home for ever , but not from punta cana you have to realize that you are in a thrid world country right on the ocean and that you should expect some sent we had no bug issues other than some tiny ants in our bathroom sink , but i brought off and sprayed one morning and never saw them again the food , well that is a totally different story the food was not good , it was bland at best and the menu 's at the resturaunts are just not like back home we lived on pizza and noodles in butter sauce , these were the few things we knew we could eat without getting sick my husband and i were sick a day each but we were fine the rest of the time the alcohol was minimal at best , they did not carry the brand i like and i tried other things but it just never really tasted the same , sometimes we thought they were just filling your drink with whatever they felt like at the time and there was no diet pepsi which for me was a real bummer overall the grounds and the view made the trip , but for the price i would say you could find other locations that would be much more worth your dollar much needed rest 
my new wife and i just got back from our honeymoon at secrets excellence in punta cana , stayed there dec going there we were so excited to spend the week away at a tropical paradise and in leaving we were quite upset with the whole experience and ready to leave this was my first all inclusive so i was not sure what to expect it sounded good , no worries about carrying money around , free drinks , good food before i booked i read the reviews and thought the people that were complaining were just too picky and stuck up sadly not the case we vacation usually once a year and i have been to quite a few different places , this is not a apple 6 star , or whatever they classify it as i will not bore you with everything that went wrong ( impossible , too many things that were not major but just kept adding up the entire time ) but i will summarize the trip room : musty smelling just like everyone said i complained once but nothing was done so we sucked it up maids would clean it between 8:00 am and 4:00 pm , different every day no honeymooners ribbon on door till my wife said something 3 times others we meet had it on their door when they arrived i even left $5 the first day thinking we would get better service , do not bother service : very inconsistent a few spoke very good english and allways had smiles on their faces most of the staff knew no english seemed like they were allways looking for tips and almost mad if you did not give one i brought $50 in singles and tipped a lot but did not feel it made any difference overall very average ( this fault surprised me the most by the end of the trip ) grounds , pool , beach : by far the best atribute of the resort great pool although a little cold plenty of chairs to lay out on great views , ocean is rough but great food : very bad i would not go back if it was just for the food long waits , poor , poor service in all of them , poor drink selection beer selection was very bad do the safari tour , we had a blast on that enjoyed the country , very diverse and pretty all in all , very poor management of this resort should have gone to mexico 
bad service , very disappointing i have to say that i was very disappointed with secrets punta cana they claim to be a 5 star resort but i would maybe give it a 3 or 3 1/2 service is what makes a good hotel and i can honestly say there was very little of that the management does not try to accommodate the guests and act as if they do not care about your concerns or problems the staff does not understand english they try , but it 's impossible for them to service you properly when they ca not understand what you need the hotel had 2 resturants closed every night and guests had to wait 2 hours for dinner some nites they were always telling us they were out of things but when pushed , they magically found it this happened with wine , goat cheese , tortilla chips in the mexican resturant to name a few they were out of something every night of our stay the maids did not turn down the beds at nite we found out when we were there that secrets was not going to be running it as of january 1 2007 it would have been nice to know this before we made arrangements to come the owner of secrets should be ashamed of himself for having his guests treated so poorly i would be hard pressed to reccommend any of the secrets resorts as a result of this experience 
cancel your trip asap my husband and i , aged 54 and 59, travel frequently during the winter , one week each month to a warmer climate for six months out of the year our agent found this all - inclusive , air included for $3000 per week so , even though we usually frequent the ritz or the four seasons , secrets rated iself highly , so we took a gamble on a bargain price room : garishly painted bright colors , improperly cleaned nasty jacuzzi , claustrophobicly small shower/toilet room the ceiling leaked each time the fellow above us showered disgustingly annoying , and apparantly un - fixable as the repair person came every day with his caulking gun to no avail no excuses here the german head chef was apologetic but unbending the head waiters were helpful , and for $20 each night allowed us to order whatever we wanted , ( complete with our explicit cooking instructions ) and so after a few days they were preparing large fresh shrimp sauted in garlic and butter and really excellently grilled fish and chicken we soon discovered that with a little tipping , anythng was possible , including properly prepared alcoholic drinks general hotel environment : typical mish mash , no real theme , but the groundskeeper 's worked very hard , as did all the workers the staff seemed to sense most guest 's disapointment , which seemed palpable to us , and tried very hard to remedy unpleasantries however , this country is very poor and really lacks the physical resources to maintain a resort of this size , and apparantly does not attract good management personnel either beach : amazing palm growth , and extremely deep and wide sand area , well maintained choppy , on the north island side , not your bathtub caribbean water experience as in other areas for us , there will always be another resort or warm beach to visit for a first timer to the caribbean , or someone who only vacations infrequently i would suggest you save your money , do a bit more research , skip the dr 
another all - inclusive we just came back from a 2- night stay at the secrets in punta ca?a the hotel was pretty much what it promised , an all - inclusive for couples the room was ok , nothing super nice - it smelled a little like mildew and on our second night , i found a roach crawling around ( not sure if it came from the garden outside or if it had been there the whole time that was a bit disgusting the pools were nice the beach was ok , very rough ocean and cream sand ( not super white as others ) - not the most beautiful beach we 've been too ( we are pretty tough on this arena as we leave in puerto rico and have had the chance to go to some amazing beaches in the caribbean ) overall , service was good except that we had a feeling everyone was expecting a tip for everything ( which should not happen in an all - inclusive ) the front desk was pretty bad the day we left we had asked to stay another 1 hour in the room and he said he would have to charge us $50 ( for a hotel room in a hotel that was not full food was good just for dinner and breakfast lunch as worse than average oh another thing , be ready for the location - it takes forever to get there 
honest review - it 's not that bad you should go i went to secrets excellence the week of november 5th i 've been to many all inclusive resorts and although there were some minor problems overall it was not that bad ride to hotelnot that bumpy i was expecting to hold on for my life there were a little potholes hear and there but i live in new york and have experience worse the ride could be over an hour depending if they have to drop other people off deal with it , relax and stop complaining you are on vacation and this is just part of it hotelupon arrival they make you feel welcome by providing a moist towel and champagne after a quick check in they show you to your room i suggest building 1-3 ( top floor for the high ceilings and closer to the main area ) the room was nice ( very typical island feel ) a wonderful hot tub in your room i was content there 's a slight musty odor ( as most caribbean islands do have ) but bring a bottle of febreeze and a scented candle you will be just fine why complain , you 're on vacation enjoy and relax my second day the front desk called me and asked me if everything was to my liking and if i need anything not to hesitate and call wow , i was impressed maids came and cleaned every day , never have a problem with the restocking of the fridge sure it 's not super super cold but cool enough to drink yes the bed is a little hard but you get used to it and get over it if you harp on little things you 'll never have fun in life foodokay not 5 star just keep in mind that dr is not known for it 's food you 'll never starve and you 'll always find something to eat if you do not like the food go to another restaruant you 're in an all inclusive breakfast was excellent there 's an omelet station , cereal , domican specialities etc i really liked lunch in the main dining room it 's buffett style but you 'll find somethin you like plus it 's indoors oceana is always very good for lunch they also cook on the beach everyday at 12:30 they have you join in many laughs and it 's pretty good dinner - bordeux is the best if you can go there every night do it mexican - not that great but edible italian - it 's buffet style decent food though i really like the fact that there 's a pizza delivery guy that goes around during the day and give you pizza on the beach and by the pool it 's great i also like the fact that there was 24 hours room service just in case you get the late night munchies drinksokay it 's watered down most all inclusives are want a buzz - in the morning have mimosas for breakfast and at night have champagne or wine you ca not water that down during the afternoon just enjoy your slushy drink hey , you do not want to be drunk by 3pm and sick do you you 'll waste your whole day like that entertainmentokay so it 's a little cheesy at night just take it with a grain of salt and enjoy it 's not broadway for goodness sake you have to go to the michael jackson show it 's the best and hysterical as all heck you must go to the beach party it 's really fun then they have a domincan foklore show very entertaining and you eat on the beach the enterainment team is awesome they always make you laugh throughout the day from having fashion shows by the pool to their antics at the disco they are so friendly maxwell does a wonderful job oh , and if you see ricardo - tell him carla from new york thinks you 're awesome and misses you gymthey have an awesome spa/gym did not have a massage but i went to the gym a couple of times they have wonderful equipment they even have a trainer who makes sure you are doing the excersises correctly just a warning - it 's hot as heck in there pool and beachokay , the beach is really rough but always clean i like calm water so i avoided swiming on the beach instead i went to the pool everyday they have queen size beds by the pool where you can lay out everday there 's a waitress that comes and takes your order so you never have to leave your bed i never had a problem with the chairs okay so there where a little problem with the floaties people do hog them 
good vacation i had to write when i saw the last review that is most rediculous thing i have ever seen the beach is kept spotless yes , you can leave the resort and see trash on the beach , but that person was misrepresnting the resort the worker work hard to keep it nice and clean for you i stayed there over then summer for 6 nights i would rate my overall stay as a 4 the moldy smell in the rooms was a big downer for me because it follows you home and does not go away until your clothes are washed 2-3 times the food was average but there was always something to enjoy the pool and beach are wonderful 
good value , great hotel and grounds , ok food punta cana is a tropical paradise we stayed at the all - inclusive , all - adult secrets excellence resort , in november 2006 it 's about an hour from the airport we heard that the resort would cease to be part of the secrets chain in january of '07 ( i believe secrets is building a new resort in punta cana in '08) , with the existing resort possibly becoming part of the hedonism chain semi - strong ocean currents prevent the resort from converting to any of the more family - oriented chains the airport itself is unique , with the only open - air thatched roof terminal i 've ever seen the hour 's drive over to the resort from the airport is a little bumpy but tolerable , in air conditioned buses for our apple vacations tour on this drive you get a good feel for how underdeveloped the country really is , and that 's putting it politically correctly the resort is gorgeous and impressive you walk into a massive open - air marble lobby , trimmed with stained wood supports while adorned with stylish wicker furniture the grounds are well - maintained , well - landscaped , and expansive sitting in my best 'resort casual ' outfit waiting for dinner in a wicker chair on the polished marble floors next to the wooden bar with a lazy fan twirling overhead and a cocktail in my hand , i told my girlfriend i felt a little like james bond just waiting for octopussy to walk up after checking in , the stroll to your room is across a covered wooden plankway which traverses a long serene pool filled with koi fish and fountains we got upgraded to the excellence club with a ground floor room ( the swim - out suite designation is slightly misleading it 's about a 20 foot walk to the edge of the pool , but we dealt with it lol ) the rooms were pretty big , all marble floors , stucco walls and columns painted in faded tropical colors , darkwood white - washed bar and bathroom , a big two - person jacuzzi tub , large sliding glass doors overlooking the pool , a marble shower , double sinks , oft - restocked mini bar , and a 4- post canopy bed that was fairly comfortable ( my girl thought it was too hard though ) the 24/7 all - adult channel that comes free with the room will undoubtedly become the running joke of your stay the only caveat to all these marble and polished ceramic tile floors is watch your step when they get wet , it 'd be easy to break an elbow slipping on a wet spot the pool is outstanding and the backbone of the resort more well - designed than any other resort pool i 've seen ( other than maybe the atlantis ' of the world ) , it 's almost more of a lazy river concept ( minus the slow current to transport you ) it 's basically a narrowish winding water trail that traces the outline of the guest room buildings and a couple of the open air restaurants , giving easy pool access regardless of your room location rafts are readily available for your relaxation , or hit the expansive swim up bar , where a big early tip will get you attention all day and well into your stay a secondary pool with a cascade waterfall seemed to be a little more serene spot for couples , and there are two semi - secluded large hottubs to take care of those swollen muscles the beach is also gorgeous by the way , with smallish but slightly rough waves and a little bit of an undertoe , but still swimable on all but the worst of days the water is clean and mostly clear with some minor sand churning , but if you 're dead set on that crystal clear azure blue water you see on carribean commercials , you may want to go elsewhere there is a series of nice shops along the winding driveway ( but heed the warnings of gouging on basic sundries like suntan lotion and bug spray - - they 're $15- $20 a bottle , so bring full bottles from home ) plus there 's a very serene modern spa decorated in light colors , marble and hardwood floors , and gurgling fountains built into the walkways i 'd highly recommend the midnight massage , which is a couples massage given in a raised open - air hut right on the beach , and can be scheduled for any time of day worth the $250, very relaxing and accompanied by the sound of the waves crashing on the sand less than 50 feet away there is an ok - sized disco with good lighting and sound systems it 's decorated a little like an upscale strip club , which is to say it 's a little dark , has marble floors ( careful again with drinks on the dance floor ) , and a bit of zebra - print fabric here and there the music is an inconsistent mix of dominican and somewhat - dated american dance music they played a 'good ' dance tune about 1 in every 3, so we still whooped it up on the dance floor a couple of nights there is a serviceable open - air sports bar for those must - see football games , but they only have about 4 tvs and i 'm not sure how extensive their satellite coverage is ( plus how do you convey do you have the penn state vs to someone with limited english who has no idea what network they 're on or what their uniforms look like they show monday night football on a projection screen right on the beach during football season which was pretty cool the nightly shows put on by the staff pretty much sucked , but the karaoke night with guests from the crowd was pretty entertaining and funny at times despite some other reviews i read , i did not think the vendors who put up tables in the lobby at night were that aggressive but then again i 'm from philly , so i 'm sure it 's all relative overall the service at the resort ranged from ok to excellent the excellence club staff was very helpful a few of the bartenders and restaurant staff were very outgoing and fun despite what your travel agent might say , tipping makes this place tick and your service will be dictated by it in some cases the maid service was very good most of the staff spoke serviceable - to - good english there 's a whole schedule of activities on any given day , so it 's easy to amuse yourself , but tough to leave the watch in the room and fully embrace the who cares what time it is mindset the crowd was pretty varied and friendly , and nobody seemed overly uptight our large group of 16 got a little rowdy around the pool bars a couple of afternoons , and not only did nobody complain , we usually had a bemused audience for our antics the beach and pool area are technically topless , but most of the repressed americans did not partake topless sunbathing seemed to be a little more popular on the less - crowded beach and at the cascade pool , and moreso earlier in the morning we met people from manchester england , chicago , st louis , norfolk , misissippi , and quite a few from the philly/new jersey area this place is a pretty good value we did a 5- night stay through apple with airfare from philly for 2 for under $3000 including tips , souvineir shopping , and drinks on the plane just in case you have not figured it out yet , you do not go all - inclusive for the quality of the food , and this was no exception people 's reaction to this obvious aspect of midscale - priced all - inclusives never ceases to amuse me everyone raves about the value of the prices both before , during , and after the trip yet during and after nearly every meal while you 're there , nobody can ever seem to stop complaining about the food the food at secrets excellence punta cana ranged from not great to ok , with one or two dishes rating as pretty good pack a few casual elegance outfits for the restaurants ( meaning pants for the men ) the best meal on the lot by far is the chateaubriand ( filet ) , at the frech restaurant called bourdeaux the mexican/dominican place was good one or two dishes at the italian place were ok i heard mixed reviews on the asian place other than that , the food offerings were not all that great lunch will likely be a starchy buffet , a burger from one of the pool bars , or wood oven pizza from room service ( delivered to the pool of course ) neither of these are very good either , but after all morning at the swim - up bar , who 's going to complain i mean the stuff is edible , just tastes a little different than back home , and you 're generally not running back for a second helping my only complaint was the mosquitos despite spraying down with off every night , my girlfriend arrived back home with 87 ( yes , she counted ) mosquito bites they seem to get bad just after sunset and go mainly for the legs , ankles , and feet bring a couple bottles of a strong mosquito repellent ( standard off did not do the trick ) other than that , i never saw a single roach or bug that i 've read in other reviews , just a few cute little salamaders from what my travel agent said , casa de campo ( pete dye 's teeth of the dog ) is a world class golf course about a 90 minute ( one way ) cab ride which costs about $90 ( one way ) from secrets the greens fees are over $300 i think despite being an avid golfer and a course collector , it did not seem worth killing most of a day in paradise and spending upwards of $500 to play one round , even if it was casa de campo i think it might be semi - close to the airport if you want to hit there before heading to the resort 
secrets excellence is not excellent i want to start off this review by stating that although i do expect a certain level of quality and service when traveling i am by no means a vacation snob i am picky but not a snob this was my second time in the dr the first time we ( hubby and i ) stayed at iberostar bavaro in nov 2004 and you can read our review at [ - - ] we are the 14th review down so we had a basis of comparison and thought we knew what to expect we stayed for 4 nights/5 days overall i?? going to state right up front we thought this resort was no where near a 5 star/6 golden apple resort after being to other 5 star resorts ( iberostar in the dr , atlantis in the bahamas , aruba , etc ) this is somewhere around a 3 my suggestion for anyone booked at this hotel now or looking to book is to contact your travel agent or tour rep and if you bought insurance switch it?? free to switch and the only cost is any cost difference from your package to the one you??e switching too? since you??e paid for a 5 star resort in most cases it will either cost the same or be just a few dollars to switch no amount of adult only exclusiveness can cover the things that just aren?? 5 star quality and made this vacation less than enjoyable trust me switch now let me also state that i booked my travel after reading another review with judy and maries travel ( just do a search and you 'll find them ) this was by far the best decision about this trip that we made if you are thinking of traveling to the dr and are planning to use a travel agent i would highly recommend them? heck even if you weren?? planning on using an agent i would still recommend using them you??l get the same price and probably much better service at your hotel drive : we got a private transfer instead of riding the bus we figured with it already being an hour away a private van would be faster than taking the bus? the drive there was awful as our driver felt compelled to race any car/bus/truck in front of us regardless of how far away it was also it is very bumpy and terribly scary as there are plenty of pot holes and hills they are building a new highway which i hope will make the drive through to the resorts more pleasant in/out : my bil booked a swim - out excellence room however when we booked we just paid for the regular garden view room when we arrived i was pleasantly surprised that the manager had arranged for us to receive a free upgrade to the excellence club because of maria and judy i had asked maria to request a 3rd floor room as i had read those are nice and again they delivered the only issue is that because we didn?? arrive with the other buses we had to wait about 10 minutes until an excellence rep came to get us to walk us to the club to check in excellence club : although a very nice touch and a great perk i would never ever pay the $70ish a day it costs to actually participate in this unless you really need internet access while on vacation rooms : these were fairly nice we were on the third floor , as requested , and i was pleased to find out that they had elevators as i sprained my ankle just before coming each room has a sink/dressing area , a separate water closet/shower room , and a jacuzzi tub the beds are definitely hard as rocks the room was always clean , no bugs , and the maid service was very nice we had turn down service which is a nice little extra the only complaint here is that the minibar isn?? an actual refrigerator but more like a high end cooler so if you opened it often by the end of the day everything would be warm for a five star resort you would think they could get actual mini fridges also because we were on the third floor our room never cooled down to where we like it but it was pleasant and workable oh and make sure you keep the little do not disturb card in your outlet thingy at all times resort : beautiful grounds they have a nice little wildlife area and amazingly enough most of the animals stayed within that area we saw a stray chicken by the pool area where we stayed but that?? about it we did see plenty of lizards which were cute the best part of this resort is that there are covered walkways throughout the whole resort and you can walk around from the main lobby to your rooms and other important parts of the resort without getting wet on the few days it rained this resort is much smaller than iberostar but just as lovely the bugs here however are another story and if you do come to secrets bring bug spray i sprayed daily and was fine until the last night when i ran out and the next day was scratching like crazy pool : secrets has two pools although we saw the cascading pool since it was on the other side of the hotel we didn?? swim there we mostly stayed in the big pool ( actually two pools since it?? cut in the middle but a little rock wall ) which runs most of the way horizontally along the beach and resort the pool is lovely and we were very pleased to see king size beds with mild cover along pool as well as chaise lounges the pool was about 4 33 ft deep everywhere which was great for everyone except me as i?? 5 foot even and had to stay on my toes the whole time in the water the blue floaties were hard to find mid day as people stated but we got there early and stayed late so we didn?? have a problem i must say i don?? understand why they don?? have more of them obviously they are at a premium and honestly for a 5 star resort they should have at least one per room available the swim up bar was nice but we mostly stayed on the other end and just had the lovely ladies who circled the area bring us drinks my biggest complaint about the pool is that if you are short like i am getting in and out of the pool is difficult stairs are located throughout the pool area but are spaced so far apart that i had to walk , on tippy toes , probably over 25 feet from where we were to the closest staircase the only walk in access was on the far left side of the pool not a big deal unless you really need to use the ladies room this basically caused to me to stay out of the pool most of the day beach : very pretty but very rough if you are used to the east coast waters , like ocean city , md , then this is pretty similar to high tide the only difference is that because the water is knee deep so far out the waves are breaking several times and cause a huge rip current we are beach people and love to play in the waves but even we found it a tad rough nightlife : the casino , where we spent most of our time , was probably twice the size of the iberostar although it had a craps table it was never opened which disappointed my husband we mostly played blackjack and roulette and had a very nice time this casino got pretty busy at night and honestly was lots of fun however as the brochure from the hotel states beware of the keno game they suck you in by giving you a free turn to start but it?? a loosing game and we never saw anyone leave winning at this game all 4 nights we played there but saw several people loose hundreds if not thousands of dollars we tried to catch two shows but honestly unless you show up 30-40 minutes before the show starts you??l never find a seat where you have a good view and can hear well what we saw were okay and probably good given where you are this isn?? vegas and we never expect a vegas show but the sound quality could be improved also shows starting at 10pm are a little late??ust my opinion we never went to the disco as it didn?? open till 11pm and honestly was quite a walk food : the food here was just plain terrible i don?? know a single person at the resort that i spoke with that thought the food was any where near a 5 star resort 
no bang for your buck my husband and i are pretty easy to please it takes a lot to elicit a terrible rating from us , but sepc managed to do so we had booked 6 months in advance our only request was a room away from the construction our room was in the middle of the construction we asked 4 different times during our stay to be moved , but each time were told there were no rooms available besides the fact that we could not sit on our patio because of scaffolding and falling contruction debris , when they started digging trenches around the building , the cockroaches came the room was o - k my only complaint here , besides the roaches , is that the shower is quite tomb - like , dark and small the food was average at best we 're on a caribbean island and i do not expect the shrimp to be frozen and tiny i ca not truly say that any meal stood out as more than average , and many were poor i love ethnic foods , but most foods were bland and improperly cooked yes , even in the french restaurant i only went to the gym once it 's on the second floor , and there was no air conditioning or fans i brought insect repellant , and took the vitamins a week before we left for our trip mosquitoes and sand fleas ate us alive in a week 's time , we only saw them spray insecticides once the disco is very 70's , with some of the entertainment staff ( mostly the women ) , engratiating themselves to you for the free drinks you could get them the entertainment staff works hard but they could vary some of their music selections , with the magician being horrible ( we heard he is the relative of one of the owners ) we might have given an o - kay rating , but considering the price relative to our experience , a no - star rating would have been more appropriate 
great time i was worried about this resort after reading some of the reviews , but we had an excellent time here we stayed from oct 22nd to 29th the weather was warm and sunny everyday with the exception of 3 days that it rained for about 15 mins here are all the good things :1 the staff is very friendly and outgoing everyone says hola when they pass you or see you the staff goes out of it 's way to make sure that you are confortable and have everything you need tipping is not required , but we found that it is greatly appreciated everytime we told a staff member thank you or gracias , they responded with it 's my pleasure the pool is perfect it just goes forever and is just the right temp to cool you down we spent most of our time at the swim up bar , where it was great to relax with a drink in the water we never had trouble finding lounge chairs no matter what time of the day it was the beach is beautifull it is very well kept the waves are huge and the red flags were out everyday , but that did not stop me or about 50 other people from body surfing and playing in the waves the rooms are pretty good sized and very cool we had to turn the air conditioner down the shower pressure amazed me for a resort in a third world country we did not sign up for the excellence club , but still got most of the perks involved we had turndown service everyday , a bottle of chaimpaign , and bath robes and slippers which are all listed as being for the excellence club world series and monday night football on a huge screen on the beach with surround sound and beer and snacks the drink of the day is usually pretty weak , but just ask the bartender for an extra shot of bacardi 151 same with all the premade drinks i read a lot of complaints about the alcahol being weak or waterdown , but i had no problems with it in fact i got drunker than i thought i could off fruity drinks sammy sosa 's are probably one of the best drinks to drink in the pool just ask for bacardi 151 to be added the not so good :1 the food was good , but not great i was worried after reading several reviews saying it was horrible it 's not horrible and in fact i enjoyed everything that i ate it just was not great food my wife is a very pickey eater and she did not complain once about the food snorkeling was not what i expected you can snorkel on the beach off the resort , but the waves were huge and we were told we would not see much , so we paid $30 a person to be taxied to another resort 7 miles down the road and then jumped into a little john boat that took us 10 mins out into the ocean the waves were still huge , i only saw two different types of fish , i could barely see the coral , my wife was stung by a jellyfish , and 3 people on the tour with us got sick and started puking into the ocean from the boat where i was still trying to snorkel i never drank the water , but i was sick two nights with stomach issues i 'm pretty sure it was something i ate , but not completely sure i was fine after going to bed and getting up the next day they allow vendors onsite a couple nights a week right around dinner time so as you walk to dinner and come out of dinner you are hassled to look at their stuff it got to be annoying the free horse ride was ok , but the horses need to eat something they were very skinny and almost sick looking my horse kept stopping to eat certain types of plants whenever he saw them i was never bit by a mosquito , but my wife was twice and some people we saw were really bit up things to bring :1 dollar bills for tipping peptoall in all we had a great time and would consider going back i would recommend going in late october since it is the end of hurricane season because the resort is not full 
how fast can you run this is not a five star hotel , trust me , two stars would be a stretch almost everything needs improvement from the facilities ( looks like a rinky dink operation ) , room , food ( nothing was exceptional , just ok ) , management ( they make no effort to be friendly or accommodating ) , activities , in other words , do not waste your time the first room ( faded yellow bedspreads with hard , squeaky mattresses , missing phone off the wall , dirty with ants ) we were assigned , looked like it had been rented by the hour , unbelievable we tried to move to another hotel but this place is so isolated once you get there going anywhere else is a real hassel they moved us to another room and it was better but still dirty , needed a make - over ( dirty seat cushions , dirty floor , grease stains on the walls where people had rested their heads ) and crawling with ants we will not waste your time with more examples , there are much nicer properties with better staff in punta cana , if you must go , but honestly , we have no plans to visit the domenican republic again anytime time soon and will probably go back to mexico before ever returning to this country absolute poverty , horrible roads ( pot holes everywhere or non - existent roads ) , mosquitoes are relentless , tourist industry is not well developed , not much to see , and the people are borderline rude , their only interest is getting money from you - - if you go shopping you will be almost be assaulted we travel extensively and this has to be one of the worst experiences we have ever had go at your own risk , we are sorry we ignored some of the previous bad reviews , they are quite accurate 
a much needed relaxing vacation my husband and i took a much needed 5 night vacation to the dominican republic last week and enjoyed our stay at secrets very much this was our first trip to the dr , having previously stayed at the ritz in montego bay , royal plantation in ocho rios , and moon palace in cancun on whole , we liked the dr and secrets better than the other locations we flew in from philadelphia and decided against taking the helicopter to the hotel because we did not want to be separated from our bags the ride to the resort was quick and scenic from the front desk , we were whisked away to the excellence club for our private check - in , champagne and cold towels ( worth the extra money if you like special attention and a nice place to go before dinner for drinks or in the morning for the best cappucino i 've ever had ) our room was beautiful we had a view of both the ocean and the pool also , because our room was on the third floor , we had the benefit of vaulted ceilings housekeeping did a wonderful job of keeping our room beautiful night and day the pool is simply amazing and it is where my husband i spend our entire day , every day particularly great about the pool are all the options for lounging you can put your chair in the sun right in the pool , or find a hut and stay cool it 's true what prior reviewers say about the blue mats - - immature people hoard them the food is good but not great and yes i did get sick one evening and i have no idea what from as a prior reviewer mentioned , unfortunately , the restaurants do not enforce the dress code even more unfortunate , however , is that people have no idea how to dress for dinner and feel the need to wear jeans and t - shirts to even the most elegant dinners my husband and i had a great time at secrets , we will return and will recommend it to our friends 
nightmare at secrets definitely not recommended my wife and i were repeat visitors to secrets excellence in the excellence club our first visit was april 2005 and was a dream our most recent visit was so messed up we wanted to return home after three days since we booked directely through secrets , and they refused to assist us in returning home we ended up trapped for an additional five days we had to endure , mice in our room , cockroaches and rats in the hotel , mold growing in our room around the shower and tub , leaking ceiling in bath area , travel sickness , rude management and poor quality food when we arrived , we noticed some differences , especially with the service and hotel maintanence we questioned some of the issues like no turn - down service and lack of quality mini - bar and were told that things have changed and are no longer provided as a five star resort , one would expect a lot more from the resort the eveneing of the third day we returned to our room to find a mouse this after sitting at the lobby bar and seeing a rat run across to floor the concierge at the excellence club tried to help until one of the hotel managers ( rooms manager ) interviened and apparently found the pest problem acceptable we were moved to another upgraded room , this one with a leaking ceiling in the bath area to top all else both of us got travel sickness at the end of the trip we joined about 75% of the visistors that we on our shuttle to the airport who also were sick to some degree this trip ranks truely as the biggest waste of time and money i have ever been part of 
okay , not great we stayed at secrets excellence october 8-15th i find it difficult to believe this resort is a 6 golden apple resort room : our room was okay cobwebs were noted as well as candle wax around the tub bed was terrible - just a mattress on wood slats very , very uncomfortable two lamps would not work and the sliding glass door screen was also broke hubby loved chanel 21 resort : loved the animals roaming the grounds the parrots were very friendly and tame this resort has an unusal smell - - i wondered what they were trying to cover up did not care for the trinket stands i am surprised the resort lets these people on the grounds - - takes $$ ( tips ) away from the employees got tired of seeing dead cockroaches in the hallways surprised to see the employees picking up the horse manure on the beach every morning with their hands employees/staff : ramone makes the best omlettes in the world you must visit him every morning and jose at the kafe cafe bar is also a must to visit with very , very personable he is one of the best francois , one of the resort photographers , is also great we came home with a lot of beautiful pictures food : okay , so it 's not the same as the us but it is satisfactory the omlettes are great as was the mexican eatery on the 4th day i got sick ( chills , vomitting and diarrhea ) i was using the ice bucket liner in the room to vomit into and the maid put the liner right back into the ice bucket without cleaning it after returning to the us i visited our local er - - could not stand the nausea  diarrhea any longer i still do not feel well today and have been home 4 days guess it takes e coli awhile to get rid of and i had even taken antibiotics with me would i return to this resort will try a different destination for our next vacation 
fun times in dr we stayed at secrets for our honeymoon the first week in october the place is truly beautiful , there is nothing better than going to breakfast and seeing the waves of the blue/green waters staff : the staff were overly friendly , they took care of our issues in a very efficient manner they spoke english very well our room was perfect no bugs cleaned daily , though at different times each day , it was so quiet where we were , i slept just as if i were at home we left a note for budlight and vodka for our minibar and did get it one day only note that the minibar fillers and the maids are not the same people pool : we spent most of our time in the smaller pool by our room , it was great , a waterfall going all the time we met great people and enjoyed ourselves each day , the weather was very hot the whole week and sunny each day the swim up bar provided daily entertainment at 4pm by fellow travelers i would only suggest they play some music by the smaller pool it would have been nice the ocean is rough , if you 're looking for some exersice you 'll get it , it 's not unreasonable to go in , it 's pretty fun if you like waves and the temperature is perfect food : we did not love it for sure it was the slow season , restaurants were not open daily the buffets worry many because of the issues of food sitting out for hours in hot weather mexican the best , followed by steak house , room service offers little if you do not mind eating the same things you 'll be fine you wo not starve but you will crave a wendys burger and fries by the time you get to the airport to go home oh do not forget to get a cold beer when you 're at the airport too , the beverages are not ice cold like we are used to the ride in : long , not too bumby , intersting to see the real dominican republic , surprisinly poor , drivers here are crazy we enjoyed are stay it is so beautiful and the people are so nice , while i 'm glad i went i am in no rush to return and would prefer to venture to new island sand places in the future 
waiste of time and money the food it really is bad we did get sick at the resort , none of the restaurants were to our liking be prepared to wait a long time at the seafood place or french dont waste your time at the italian or dominican restaurants , they were inedible the pizza is ok , but gets boring after awhile drinks are ok , if you tip bartenders your drinks will get better the spa : a real ripoff so dont waste your time also the ammenties like the steam room and sauna were not working properly the rooms : are nice and cold , but the beds are very hard very thin blanket and not comfortable the beach : was very very rough , all in all spc is not 6 apple resort great pools , and not lots to do very little entertaiment if any my suggestion is to get antibiotic from a doctor or bring lots of pepto i did suffer from major stomach sickness for 8 days after i returned home , but i believe it was from the ice tea or ice , but who knows the resort was only about 25% occupied when were there so that was nice it 's all inclusive resort but premium liquors are not on the menu staff speaks very little english we have been to other islands , and this one was not what we hoped for 
good times we had a great time the beach was beautiful , resort was clean the entertainment staff made our trip , in paticular julio , wilkins , and maxwell they were always making sure that everyone was getting involved in activities such as volleyball and water polo they made my husbands vacation 
secrets excellence - excellent my wife and i just returned from 5 days at the resort it was wonderful the grounds were beautiful the pools were magnificent the beach was breathtaking there was plenty of room everywhere i would estimate that the resort was less than 50% occupied the staff was very friendly , and very well trained the food was good do not expect gourmet meals , but good food with very nice presentations i did not give the resort 5 stars because of minor maintenance issues , ( broken tiles , chipped paint , etc all very minor we had no problems with bugs in our room there are bugs on the beach at night it is a tropical island the staff provided bug spray for night events on the beach lauderdale , fl 
a nice getaway my husband and i stayed at secrets excellence in mid august for a 4 day getaway we booked through apple vacations and had absolutely no problems with them they are great we booked a 6 apple square deal , so we did not know where we were staying until we got to the airport that morning i was happy to hear we were staying at secrets the flight was nice and the shuttle to the resort was a bumpy , rough ride , but streets around chicago are worse i was surprised at how nice the shuttle bus was , and the ac worked great we got to the resort , we did not get a warm friendly greeting as some have posted , just your averge hotel check in i had a hard time understanding the girl checking us in , and therefore had a hard time finding our room and the restaurants but we figured everthing out on our own we had to wait an hour or two for our luggage , i wish we would have just taken it ourselves overall we had a nice time we did not have any complaints with secrets , but nothing stood out as spectacular we did tip the housekeeping staff as well as the waiters and waitresses , but we felt this was an odd practice at an all - inclusive resort we got the impression that the staff was not giving you their all , unless you gave a tip which is not what we are used to from all - inclusive resorts the food was good , but again , nothing spectacular the omelet station for breakfast was wonderful a few tips that i had read before we left that i am very glad i knew bring crystal lite ( or any other brand ) drink sticks for the bottled water you need to drink a lot of water down there , for it is very hot i thought even the bottled water tasted a little funny , so i am glad i had the drink sticks with brush your teeth with the bottled water neither my husband or i got sick the entire time we were there , or after we returned home wear you sandals at all times the cement around the pool and even the sand is extremely hot and will burn your feet bring a lot of sun screen , a bottle of aloe vera , and some sun screen for your lips we never had any problems getting a float for the pool , but it seemed that we did get out earlier than others by noon or so the pool was not even cool and refreshing anymore secrets was a nice place , but personally i think we really did not enjoy the dominican republic it was much too hot and humid for our taste , and the country side was not much to look at i know it is a third world country , but so is jamaica and we found that much more lush and picturesque 
great time i was very nervous about our selection to go to secrets after reading all the poor reviews i honestly do not know who was writing these reviews , my boyfriend and i had a blast : ) the ride from the airport was long about 1 5 hours but it was nice to see the country and how they live i think i was just excited to get my vacation started but did appreciate seeing the view from the air conditioned bus : ) when we arrived we were handed a cool washcloth and drink while checking in which was quick when we arrived at our room our luggage was arleady there and ready for us the room was clean we were in room 5005 and it was very close to the cascade pool i would recomend staying over there near that pool dont let your vacation go by w/o checking out this pool i loved it , it was deeper and much less crowded that the main pool and there was also a bar there never any problems getting a raft there ok , well the beds werent the best but i slept ok , but i dont think anyone sleeps as well as they do in their own bed : ) the food was good breakfast and lunch wasnt to exctiing but it was good dinner was awesome so many choices , we loved the french resturant , borduex and went there twice i had no problems with getting sick from the food and i ate the salad all the people i talked to had no problems as well we never made a reservation but did have to wait one night for about 45 min at burduex , although we enjoyed listening to the paino bar and having a few cocktails before dinner the shows are fun , the atomsphere is very nice the micheal jackson show is the best i didnt spent to much time in the disco b c we were tired from the sun all day i would bring 50$ in tips we tipped , and the workers really appreciate it i got my hair braided and the lady who braided it said the workers make $300/month its hard to find someone to braid your hair but she is down the beach at the end and her name is nancy she will do it for a lot less than anyone else well have fun and if you want some pics of the area or anymore info feel free to email me at stacyk556789@yahoo 
overall experience an a but details a c backgroundmy ( now ) husband (34) and i (33) have only a moderate level of travel experience i have traveled extensively in the u prior to this we go on weekend trips now and then , but have never taken a real vacation together until our honeymoon before booking , we used the suggestions of friends and family , as well as tripadvisior , to decide on our destination and resort at that time , there were only good reviews of secrets on this site , and we booked our stay with complete confidence that it would be fantastic reviews prior to our trip made us quite nervous about or choice , but we never considered cancelling our trip was 7/17 to 7/25/06 arrivali had read enough reviews that i was prepared for different aspects of the arrival : the nontraditional airport , the $10 tourist charge , and even the bus ride luckily , i was so tired from lack of sleep and the flight that i slept for most of the bus ride to the resort , so it did not seem that bad ( the way back to the airport was a different story - i was very close to getting sick on the bus , and i am not prone to car sickness when we arrived at the resort , there were many ( probably 12) couples all trying to check in the coupes ahead of us all got a drink , but the waitress ran out just before she got to my husband and i when she left , i expected that she 'd return with more drinks for the many couples that had not been served i was mistaken we did get cool towels check - in was fairly quick and easy roomwe booked an ocean view suite and were given that ( note : almost everyone there is getting married , on a honeymoon , or celebrating an anniversary , so do not expect an upgrade ) unfortunately , i had ignored the free advice in these reviews about the beautiful 3rd floor rooms with the high ceilings , and never emailed to request a 3rd floor room when we saw our room , we were very disappointed in many ways we were on the first floor , which did not lend itself to a good ocean view i could have lived with that , except for the smell there was a very strong mildew smell in the room that i could not get past after deciding that i really could not live with the smell for 9 days , i called the front desk to request a change after being questioned about the smell and whether the room change was really necessary , i was told that they probably would not be able to accommodate the request until the following day i accepted that , and decided to make the best of it during the 24 hours that we were in the room , we determined that we had no robes ( as promised ) , the jets in our jacuzzi tub did not work , and the bed was quite uncomfortable it really felt more like a boxspring than a mattress ( many couples we met commented on how uncomfortable the beds were , so it was not just us ) we did get our room switched , but only after being politely persistent at the suggestion of another couple , we enlisted the help of the concierege , and that seemed to get things moving a little more quickly new room was on the second floor - better view and no smell tub worked , and we got our robes on the 4th day however , refridgerator took full 24+ hours to cool down drinks my only complaints are the same that you 've heard before in these reviews - people stake out there spots early , and do not show up for half the day ( if at all people hoarde the floats pool closes earlier than i would have expected lots of shaded or sunny spots to relax ( but not always the place you 'd prefer ) water is a little rough breakfast was my favorite , as i loved the omlette station i second some of the other reviewers ' comments about the difficulty of getting lunch - i would have preferred a couple more a la carte options and was underwhelmed by the beach barbeques we tried most of the restaurants for dinner the chinese was just plain bad , although they did have the best dessert there ( chocolate chip cheesecake ) the other restaurants were good but not great we got pizza a few times , which was quite good , and opted for room service once , which took about 30 minutes and was also good drinksheed the suggestions in these reviews , and bring a large , insulated cup after a couple days of melted , warm drinks , we bought insulated coffee mugs in the gift shop ( $10 each ) , and it made a world of difference drinks seemed to vary between weak and strong drinks ordered by name varied greatly in taste from bartender to bartended illnessboth my husband and i experienced some intestinal distress during our stay , even after being careful about the water my husband 's sickness lasted a full day , but then he was fine mine was less intense but lasted more than half of our 9 day stay i tried not to let it ruin our fun , but the twisting , painful stomach cramps sometimes made that difficult immodium and pepto helped , but bring your own so you do not have to fork over big $ bugsbring bug spray or wipes we definitely needed them a few nights excursionswe had planned to do one or two excurions , but our intestinal distress stopped us there were mixed reviews from other couples we talked with entertainmentit 's not broadway it 's not vegas adjust your expectations accordingly , and you will be entertained definitely check out the michael jackson impersonator - that was my favorite show by far the casino was small but fun - won a little $ at the slots and quickly lost it in blackjack ( again , it 's not vegas , so do not expect that ) never made it to the disco activitiesthere are lots of free activities offered covering a variety of interests in all honesty , we did not participate in many several times , we signed up for things ( bike tour , snorkeling , etc ) and were so content relaxing by the pool or ocean with a drink that we cancelled by the time we tried to sign up for our free horseback riding , it was booked ( so book early in your stay overall , i really did like that fact that activities were offered but not pushed on us serviceservice was like the food - inconsistent some people were pleasant , friendly , and efficient while no one was outwardly rude , several acted as they would really prefer not to be bothered by our ( reasonable ) requests ( for a drink , utensils , etc ) i will say that while i am now a psychologist , i worked as a waitress on and off during my college years , so i feel that i have some perspective on this i try not to hold servers responsible for aspects of the service that are beyond their control - length of wait , food quality , etc that being said , many could have used slightly better people skills however , they all seemed to be very hard working we often saw a server at one restaurant at 9:00am for breakfast and at another restaurant at 8pm for dinner we also learned from one bartender that the staff at the resort works 13 days in a row and then get 3 days off , so they do work hard tippingseemed to significantly impact service at the bars , less so at the restaurants helped get a few extra bottles of water , soda , and beer in the minibar 
hot off the press entertainment excellente wow we had a wonderful time at this resort we went for our honeymoon and we could not have asked for a better place first , my husband will write a review on what he thought about this resort and i will then continue airport transfers : we booked this trip through honeymoons inc which is also travel impressions our agent liann , gave us all the information we needed prior to travel which included all the little tid bits of getting in and out of the country without problems upon arrival it will cost you $10 00 per person to enter the country you will get a tourism card for it ten seconds later they will take it from you and you 're in it 's probably the quickest $10 00 you will ever spend after that , you pick up your luggage and head to the exit where the baggage handelers have you blocked in i was going to carry my own bags until i saw the barricade of handelers so i gave the guy a buck and he lead me to the shuttle bus guy who then directed us to our bus they have one guy with a clip board outside the exit who has names and shuttle bus information you can bypass the handelers if you want , you just need to find the guy with the clip board and he will direct you to your bus we were then transferred to secrets by vip transportation and i was impressed pachi pachi was a respectfull driver and he kept his van spotless we never stopped , which was nice in jamaica our transfer stopped at their families beer and gift shop where the prices were very high i have heard this happens in punta cana sometimes , but not with vip the ride is a bit rough , scary at times , but remember its the dom upon arrival to secrets i was very impressed the resort is awesome , beautiful , clean , perfect gardens , etc now i will finish the review check in and rooms : i was told prior to our trip here that the resort had some construction going on around towers 11 and 12 well , when we went to the front desk to receive our room keys , the receptionist ( laura ) booked us in room 11108 ( which is located in tower 11) i told my husband about what i read on trip advisor and that this room might become a problem for us well laura , whom is wonderful by the way , advised us that she was unable to move us to a different room at this time because they were all booked up but , she told us to come see her later the next day and she will she what she can do well , we did and we got upgraded to a master suite in tower 5 my husband put about $2 00 in the fridge and left a note for the gentleman that he would love to have some budweiser and some brugal ( dominican rum ) to our surprise , that guy kept our bar stocked with that stuff everyday he was fabulous some other pointers to keep in mind : keep your air conditioner on - - if not , the floor will start sweating put all your used or dirty towels in a pile together on the floor - - - the maid really does appreciate that leave your maid $1 00 everyday - - she will love you forever your ironing board and iron are located behind the curtains - - - we could not find them at first read your book about the resort that they put in your room - - useful tips the rooms may have a slight mildew smell - - but keep in mind - - - you are in the tropics - - - this happens food , bars , and service : let 's face it , the room service food is not that great , but it 's room service and it is what it is - - - desperation food if you are starving , then it is definately edible there are so many other places to eat on the resort that you should not even have to order in room service also , it takes aobut 50 minutes to get the food two good places to eat during the day was at the world cafe ( buffet ) or on the beach ( the entertainment staff would barbecue or make fajitas everyday ) my husband said that the food was heavily salted now , i love salt so for me it was not that bad but , i did try some of his beans one day and ugghhh - - - salty but hey - - try something else it is an all inclusive resort alot of people have complained about the food but what they fail to realize is that this resort has so many other options i am a super picky eater and i found something that i absolutely loved everyday you can drink the water at the resturaunts they filter all their water and even their ice we did not have one problem with that our favorite resturaunts were both the bordeux and el patio at bordeux , get the chatuebriand ( sp ) and at el patio , definately get the creame conde it 's a bean and light cheese soup and let me tell you - - - it is to die for all the resturaunts were awesome if you are doing the homeymoon dinner for two , definately book it at seaside grill if you can to break it down a bit - - - - breakfast - good lunch - okay dinner - fabulous moving on the to bars gosh - - the bartenders here are so funny you have to stop at the bar right there by the beach and see benjamin definately my husband 's favorite guy he will tell you tons of funny jokes and he knows how to make some good , strong drinks he was great at the cascade pool bar , see vidal he 's a little quite , but he has no problem making sure that you are satified with your drink at the showtime bar ( the big long bar in the lobby ) you have to stop by and say hi to moya very personable and funny 
sandals my husband and i just got back from secrets we were there from august 5- august 11 prior to the trip , i was on this website almost daily checking the reviews of other vacationers we came very close to cancelling our reservations because the reviews were just scary but , i am so glad we went thru with the trip overall , the resort is excellant the only complaint was that the food is only okay everything is very salty it is edible , but definitely not fine dining we went to sandals in st lucia for our honeymoon two years ago , and i know there will be people that will be considering secrets vs sandals we stayed at the sandals halcyon , but we spent a great deal of time at sandals regency and sandals grande when we were there so , for the purpose of my review , i wo not focus on just one sandals resort in st lucia , but rather the overall experience here 's my thoughts on which resort company was better in the follow categories : beaches : secretssandals beaches do not have security , and vendors will harass you constantly , but at secrets , there is security guards at both end of the beach so no harassment , and the palpapas where just were awesome to relax under also , secrets has cocktail waitresses come onto the beach and bring you drinks constantly however , sandals does offer more water activities ( i water cycling , wind sailing etc ) while secrets only has snorkeling and boogie boarding on the beach which i suspect is because the water is somewhat rough and the coral reefs are very close to the shore however , the water is a pretty aquamarine blue at secrets while it was just a dull grey at sandals the beach at secrets is probably the nicest beach i have ever been to we really enjoyed our long walks on the beach and taking in the amazing scenary of the swaying palm trees , and the crystal clear blue waters service : both are great both resort were staffed with friendly people that were attentive and pleasant we received great service on both our vacations obviously at secrets there is a language barrier , but you can tell by their smile , tone of voice , and body language that they are glad to help food : sandalsthe food at the sandals resorts in st lucia were amazing it was like dining out at 5 star restaurants each and every night everything from appetizers , main courses , dessert to the salads were great secrets , on the other hand , had okay food at best the french and mexican restaurants were good , but everything else was way too salty , and bland tasting if food is important to you , sandals is a better bet pool : secretsthe pools at the sandals regency and sandals grande are very nice , but secrets has the largest pool i have ever seen there 's beds , palpapas , and plenty of lounge chairs there 's also cocktail waitresses overall , i really enjoyed the pool at secrets the cascade pool was very relaxing as well whirlpools : sandalssandals had some really nice large and warm whirlpools located throughout their resorts it was very relaxing to sit in them at night however , the whirlpools at secrets were very small and the water was not warm at all but , secrets does offer jucuzzis in all the rooms , so that makes up for it somewhat but we really enjoyed the whirlpools at sandals and we were disappointed that the whirlpools at secrets were not as nice ambience/resort grounds : secretssandals is a couples resort so there is definitely the feel of romance in the air more so than at secrets which is just an adult only resort the grounds at sandals are nice , but secrets grounds are just breathtakingly amazing the landscaping is just beautiful from the walkways , to the water gardens , the greenery , to the bridge that crosses over the main pool rooms : secretsduring both trips , we booked the basic room at sandals we got a room that was very close to the street so we coulad hear cars driving by , and the bathroom was dated , and dirty at secrets , we ended up switching rooms 3 times the first room was a nice room near the cascade pool but it had double beds , so we immediately asked to be switched the 2nd room was in an adjacent building to the cascade pool but it was on the first floor and it smelled of mildew so , we asked to be moved again , and 3rd time is the charm because we ended up in building 14, in a room on the 3rd floor even though it is a garden view room , we had amazing views of the ocean from our patio because it is the edge of the resort we also had cathedral ceilings which made the room extremely spacious and airy bar : bothboth the sandal resorts and secrets had swim up bar what we really liked about sandals was that they had crazy and very extensive cocktail menus my husband and i made sure to try the many tropical and fruity cocktail offerings they had the bartenders at secrets will make you anything , but their menu selection is small , and we had no idea what liquors went into the fun drinks we had at sandals but , secrets does have the famous coco locos ( a coconut/rum drink served in the coconut shell ) that we enjoyed almost daily when we were there also , dr is just a very poor country we went on a 4 wheeler tour , and we were constantly approached by kids for money that never happened to us in st lucia also , both my husband and i got sick while in dr i do not think it was the resort 's fault as i suspect it was the water that got us sick we did not get sick in st lucia also , sandals has a no tipping policy , so guests are asked to not tip , and even if you attempt to tip , the resort employees will not take your money however , at secrets , although tipping is not mandatory , we felt horrible if we did not tip because everyone else was tipping and because they really do appreciate the tipping towards the end of the trip , we ran out of dollar bills for tipping , and it created an unneeded level of stress for us because we did not have access to more us dollars , which is what they prefer so overall , we really enjoyed secrets but , we also really enjoyed sandals as well you really ca not go wrong at either place , but if you like food especially good food , sandals is a better choice but if food is only part of the equation for an enjoyable vacation , secrets is a great choice we really enjoyed the beach at secrets we never felt safe just unwinding and relaxing at the sandal beaches , but at secrets , we were able to just kick back , and take it easy under a palpapas all afternoon long without any worries we were looking for a relaxing and laid back vacation , and secrets definitely provided that for us 
this place is terrible i 'm not a picky person at all so trust me when i say you will be dissapointed i had a destination wedding with 30 guests in punta cana on 7/23/06 @ the paradisus in punta cana , we were there for week and half then on the sugguestion of our travel agent we went to secrets for 1 week fpr our honeymoon we wished we stayed where we were major negatives - very dirty property , not well maintaned , rooms are not clean , housekeeping is terrible we waited 1 and 1/2 hours for an iron and ironing board that should have been in our room already hotel style rooms nothing great and we paid for a honeymoon suite beach is not guarded so it feels very unsafe , i would not dare go on it at night ocean is super rought you are on the atlantic sidethe pool is not even lit at night it 's super dark at this place it really is kinda spooky not romantic we had cockroaches in our room the size of golf ball and as far as people being friendly not really they were okay but you ca not even compare this place to the paradisus i 'm so glad that my wedding with my guests was there and not at secrets or i would have been embarresed the pool sucks yeah it 's big but it 's not conectted so you have to get out and get back in like the swim up bar is in the middle but it 's not attached to the rest of anything they were doing construction in our building and we turned on the shower all this black dirty water camed gushing out why would not you warn your guests the food was not bad they had a lot to choose from it 's not gourmet but it is not terrible either we spoke to many other guests and we did not meet one couple who liked this place and would go back no body was thrilled you ca not make reservations at any resturant so you have to either get there at 5:00 or wait like 2 hours overall this place sucked i was actually happy to be leaving and going home 
our honeymoon was excellent our honeymoon at secrets excellence was great after reading some of the reviews on this site , i was a little nervous for our trip , but the resort was great , and we had an excellent time top reasons to go to secrets excellence :1) the beach is awesome , and definitely the best part of the entire resort the beach is very wide and very clean the ocean is a beautiful tropical blue - ish , green and there were waves - but the gentle kind of waves that you could jump and not be knocked over we only had one day when there were alot of bugs and that was just because the wind changed directions 2) the employees at secrets are some of the nicest people i 've ever met they enjoy when you attempt a little spanish ( even if you only know how to say bien or excellente ) if you say , thank you , they always respond with it 's a pleasure it 's completely relaxing after the exhausting few weeks leading up to our wedding , we were excited to just lay by the pool and the beach and take long naps in the afternoon this was definitely the place to do that things you should know before you go :1) you do not have to tip , but the staff appreciates it when you do it 's totally up to you 2) you ca not drink the tap water because it is not treated - it 's only for showering and brushing your teeth the resort uses bottled water in all the restaurants and it is available at any bar we were told to limit our intake of the fruit each day our travel agent told us that too many fruity cocktails or too much pineapple , bananas or coconuts would cause an upset stomach - we limited our intake and we were fine ( this is because the fruits are treated differently [chemically] than the fruits you are used to in the usa the excellence club and the honeymoon package are worth it the staff in the excellence club were extremely helpful and kind when we checked in at the normal check - in , we were told to wait and within minutes a concierge from the excellence club met us , gave us a brief tour , and took us for private check - in we were greeted with champagne , appetizers and a cold cloth to cool down our bags were waiting in our room when we got there 5) the private dinner on the beach is totally worth it the steak was the best piece of meat we ate the entire time , and again , the staff serving the meal was great if you are a pool person and like to float in the pool , get up early to claim a raft there are a limited number , and were usually taken by about 9:00 am the mini - bar consists of some soda and four beers ( el presidente and budweiser ) there is no hard alcohol in it bud lite is available upon request at many of the bars the only thing that could have been better about our trip was the food it 's not that any of the food was bad , it 's just that it was not great there were plenty of options , and we did not get sick from any of it like someone wrote in another review , if you want your favorite meal from your neighborhood restaurant , go to your neighborhood restaurant it was actually sort of nice not to be served the obscenely large portions you usually get in the u , they serve normally sized portions at secrets we would definitely recommend secrets to other honeymoon couples hope you enjoy your trip as much as we did 
save yourself the trouble , go to mexico for all of you that do not know , secrets excellence has been sold in return you receive terrible service , awful food and rude hostesses our room the rooms at the resort leave something to be desired the beds are rock hard and the refrigerator can barely keep your drinks cold the air conditioner blasts you with a spray of mold and mildew we called guest services with many complaints , including the smell from the a/c , lack of room service menu , no complimentary robes guest services brought our robes the next day , but never accomodated us on our other problems the language gap may have had something to do with it if you have any problems after 8 pm , please do not call guest services for they will not understand a word you are saying the rooms are so muggy that if your clothes are the least bit wet , they will never dry on their own forget about the laundry service , to wash a single pair of underwear you will be forking over 3 bucks foodin a nutshell , the food was terrible like many of the reviews before mine , it seemed that the only palatable food at the buffets was the pizza the beef is oversalted and tended to be overcooked it seems that the food selections are more for europeans than americans the formal restaurants were good and offered what seemed to be better quality meat i would recommend bordeaux , the chateau briand was good and the service was very friendly in all , the nicer the venue the better the food you are off getting dressed up every night and frequenting el patio or bordeaux , for all of the other restaurants are a complete waste of time oh yeah , and get there early , the wait at the formal restauarants can be long they only have about 50 tables alcoholwhat do you expect , its all inclusive tip early and often , and you will receive good , strong drinks benjamin at the beach side bar is friendly and knows how to make many tasty drinks i do not have to many complaints about the bartending staff as long as you order simple drinks you wo not have too many problems pools and beachluckily the resort was not too crowded we spent most of our time at the waterfall pool the pool was nice , but had few chairs near the water get there early or you wo not get a seat the beach had great views , but they need to comb it we found broken glass , litter , and alot of driftwood t take care of their beach property at all in all , we wo not be going back to this resort we may never go back to punta cana this resort was rated as a 6 golden apple , apples highest grade i would give this resort a 4 we stayed at a 5 apple in mexico ( aventura spa palace ) and it blew this resort away in terms of appearance , service , food , etc save yourself alot of aggravation and go to mexico the people are friendlier and are able to meet the standards of spoiled americans , like us 
disappointed honeymooners of course we were estatic about our 1st trip to the dominican , and it was our honeymoon to boot and we made the best of everything and enjoyed ourselves despite the many problems we encountered when we first arrived , we found that our room was right next to a constuction area we contacted the front desk who said that there were no other oceanview rooms available that day , but they could move us in two days they also assured us that we would not have any problem with noise both explanations were false they never moved our room and we were plagued with hammering and drilling and sawing for the entire trip the first day we arrived around 4pm a time when all of the restaurants were closed until 6:30pm we were starved and ended up having to order pizza to the room to hold us over until dinner i enjoyed all the dinner meals we had but i was disappointed with all the other food since we are not big drinkers , the drinks were fine but i only got a buzz from the wine at dinner but the problem with the restaurants were the limited times they were open , and when one restuarant was open , another was closed their schedule was unpredictable it was difficult scheduling activities that you wanted because though we tried to arrange everything our very 1st day , most events were already booked up for the stay the available activities were ones you had to pay additional costs for even the horseback riding tour was only a half hour long , if you wanted more , you had to pay more my biggest problems were that there were never any rafts for use , there were mosquitos everywhere and despite using repellant continuously ( my legs are riddled with itchy bites ) , and the bed was like a slab of concrete i complained about all of these things throughout the trip and received excuses , but no compensation lastly , everything supposedly included in the honeymoon package was a hoax the fruit plate is 2 whole apples and a kiwi , the champagne bottle is not chilled , there are no rose petals or bathrobes , and the special dinner for two ends up being at the mexican restaurant with a room full of other honeymooners for a disappointing meal where you ca not even choose from a broad menu i 'll never go back to secrets resort 
a little bit more then a secret or excellente me and my husband stayed at secrets excellence for our aniversary let 's start with the review : hotel - the hotel was beautiful as we pulled up??iffrent types of animals and nice landscaping that they are trying to keep from going downhill the front desk was very courteous to us as we checked in paulina was great roomsthe rooms are really nice we were in room 9107??here is a lot of misquitos at this resort due to foliage and trees the next morning we had ants in our room , but it is the caribbean , expect bugs they do not bite pool  beach - loved it the swim up bar was really nice and there are plenty of empty beds during the day we never had a problem getting one , but a raft was a diffrent story i should of brought my own like some people the water was warm and clean the beach was beautiful we went in a couple of times food - what to say beside this was the worse part of the hotel first day there we went to the world cafe for dinner since it was the one someone recommended the food their is a little to be desired and if you like pastas just sitting out with no refrigeration then you can eat it , i wo not the only thing really to eat during the our staywas either the pizza or ribs dinner was alittle better in the oceana and the el patio - we had our romantic dinner there and the mosquitos joined us we never ate so fast in our lives you have to be careful what you eat here or you will be buying the $10 medicine out of the pharmacy it will keep you off the toliet for a little bit alcohol - the drinks were watered down from the ice melting so quickly , you had to bring insulated cups ( we did ) the bottles of water had a chill on them they did not have premium drinks their you could get all the rum punch and copacana 's you wanted but no hennesey or grey goose my husband drinks mgd and he was able to get that at the lobby bar or in the casino entertainment - it was amusing the hotelentertainment staff is great inez , maria and isrealsuperman micheal jackson and the magician were a good act to i would return to secrets again , just not the one in d i am glad i got a chance to see how it is there 
secretst excellence in punta cana has a secret i have to say that when me and my husband got to scerets itwas very nice , but for the money that we pay we expected more let me say that we got married in the melia caribe tropical and went for our honeymoon to secrets excellence upon our arrival and check in we decided to upgrade to be part of the excellence club which did not mean - - - - theyt old us that we were going to receive an ocean view room the next morning because they di dnot have any available however , once we got to our room that day , the outside of our room was completely full of mosquitos so i had to call the front desk so they can come to the room and fumigate then we decided to take a walk what a bad idea that was , as soon as i left the room i was bitten by 5 mosquitos i had to turn back and wear long pants then this led me to go to the hotels pharmacy and by anti - flammatory cream , bug spray and bug spray for the room and this was suppose to be my honey moon after all this , we decided to pass by the frnech restaurant to make sure we did not need a reservation that according to the front desk agent named pauline she said we did not need any reservation because we belonged to the exclusive club once we got to the restaurant the lady looked at me and my husband top to bottom and when we asked that we were there to reconfirm that we did not need a reservation because of the exclusive club , she tunred around and said that did not mean anything there i just wanted to leave this stupid hotel after this i went back to my room to take a shower and get dressed to go see the nightly entertainement and have dinner this was when things got really scary i received a phone call from an american person claiming that he had a huge fight with his girlfriend that was a model and he claimed that he was just a few rooms from us and that he called the our room to excuse himself for the noise , however , he continued to tell me that if i had an idea what his girlfriend had done to him i would of reacted the same way and he began to tell me the story this was when i just thought someone was watching us and i told him to speak to my husband and once my husband got to the phone he hung up the phone to wrap it all up i tried to tell the general manager and all he said was that maybe this was an ex - boyfriend of mine this was when i decided to leave this hotel that same night i called expedia to cancel the reservation and return to melia caribe tropical and i could not do anything until the next morning the next morning i called expedia again and cancelled my reservation , however , they charged me 250 00 for the calls i made to expedia , however , after i arrived to ny expedia refund this back to me however , the general manager and the room division manager did not do - - - - to help us the beach at this resort was so ugly , and believe me i am originally from the dominican republic and the beaches there are beautiful exce[t for this one i have to say that the melia caribe tropical it 's 10 x better than secrets excellence they treated us so nice and the staff was extraordinary i just have to say that secret excellence does have a secret it - - - - - big time therefore , do not even think of going here i was informed by many people of that area that the beach at secrets excellence have many sharks becuase it 's bythe atlantic ocean this beach has around 5 waves coming at one time 
in a nutshell avoid avoid avoid for my 15th wedding anniversary , i wanted something very nice i read the reveiws here and other places it looked like a solid choice i 'm an international airline pilot , so i think i can be fair here our 60 minute ride from punta cana airport was gut churning , as our driver dodged the minefield of potholes ( as other drivers passed him ) we were happy to arrive in one piece and thought we 'd grab a nice lunch how about a hotdog or pizza ( the other 7 restaurants were closed until dinner ) i paid $300 per night not too impressive if you 're not into tatoos , budweiser , and poor service you may want to take a pass on this one to the room there were parts strewn across the floor from the broken jacuzzi under repair tin meenutes senior ok no sweat 30 minutes later they had it buttoned up after getting a short nap , we jumped into the jacuzzi bam bam bam at the door water is pouring in downstairs on a guest the food was , well awful , with the lone exception of the bordeaux restaurant , wich was very good if the bordeaux was an 8 ( out of 10) , the other restaurants were a 2 ( and that 's generous ) ah , but we 're there for the sun and fun let 's go horseback riding sorry amigo , the next 3 days are already full ( i thought this was the off season ) ok , let 's go take the catamaran out but not today go to sunscapes by cab and you can rent one there ahh was not this supposed to be an all - inclusive another couple we met suggested we lower our expectations early and it wo not be too bad another couple , an army west pointer and his wife on their honeymoon were as underwhelmed  as we were another guest we befriended made a trip to the doctor for food poisoning me , well , i 'm on my 4th dose of immodium as i try to recover from the food yep , my wife is in the same boat over the course of our 4 day stay , i let the managers ( raphael  daniel ) know how terrible the service was daniel said he disagreed only laugh and pass it on to you folks here in fairness , they did comp a massage and the phone charges if you enjoy a good drink , be sure to bring one along the liquor was bottom shelf ( good stuff extra ) and the add a lot of water to them i read some of the glowing reveiws here , but my experience is what it was the beach is beautiful the locals are very nice still for the money , i would not go back i have heard that other parts of the island ( like romana ) are wonderful i 'd look there instread of punta cana 
not so excellente so my dh and i went to punta cana on thursday july 13th and came back tuesday july 18th we went with two other couples all in all , we had an ok time , but i def would not go back to the dominican republic it just was not our style here 's the scoop :1 bus ride from hotel is longer and bumpier than we had exprected we were expecting 45 - 60 minutes , it was more like 90 minutes quite a ride to the resort the resort is beautiful which is just as well because you wo not want to go off the resort lots of wildlife all over the place lots to see the pools are beautiful and clean you 'll be spending most of your days here since the pools close at 7pm ( who knew go to the cascade pool totally different atmosphere and it 's soo nice do not plan on getting drunk here yes , it 's an all inclusive with open bar but for some reason the only way we could get a buzz was with wine white zinfandel to be exact which was not included , $17 per bottle , which by the way , got really hard to find after the 3rd night the food is terrible best place for dinner is the bordeax do not bother going to himitsu or de mario dh and i liked el patio they had the best dessert there when you go , make sure they do not put you in building 11 or 12 as there is construction going on which made it impossible to get in a nap at all during the day we delt with it for the first 2 days then , we asked to be moved they moved us to a master suite in building 5 near the cascade pool the rooms on the top floor have vaulted ceilings oh yea , be prepared to dish out $10 as soon as you arrive at the airport for a tourist card ( which they 'll take right back from you 10 feet away come with lots of singles and cash there 's no atm on the premises learn some simple spanish phrases do not expect it to be equivalent to a 5 star resort in the us go with an open mind and you 'll have a good time 
hated it this place is horrible from the minute we walked in the doors the people who work there do not want to make your stay enjoyable the food is the worst food i have ever tasted and the alcohol is compeletly watered down i saw them open new bottles but it was not the real deal we overpaid for this horrible vacation if you are going there is nothing for kids to do after dinner no movies in room no lounge chairs available on the beach over crowed and terrible do not go there 
we had a good time the hotel was beautiful , and the wedding we saw out of our windows were extremely romantic ( just in case anyone is looking for a hotel for their ceremony the beach and the four pools was really great , and the service was excellent large clean rooms with a very large , luxurious bathroom i loved the little bus that takes you around the territory so you do not feel too bad if you get a room further from the large , main pool and the beach the other four pools were also great and reachable from every room on the territory overall , highly recommended 
very bad well , i went with my friend they say punta cana is expensive and beautiful start with the beach : it was brown and dirty , the water wasnt clean at all , ther was lots of whole and they closed some part of it the service was ok ( even though we had the gold bracelet ) , the food was ok i thought untill i got food poisoned for 4 days and i went for 1 week so i was kept in the hospital the hotel did very less about it , but bcuz i had insurance , they took care of me very little thank god i had insurance , could of imagine its very americasined , its not like cuba where u feel the good latin music , the dance at the hotel , they would put slow american music from the 90s and the tourists look so down ( i have been traveling alot and to see bahia principe like this is sad ) theyr show was all about michael jakcson brtiney spears , tony braxton nothing like in their dominican traditional dance music or simply latin dance so everyone can dance together the vibe was dead , there wasnt good energy you wanna party not the place to go as couple : yes 
extra large resort the entire site is generally very well maintained , clean and the gardens are beautiful dominicanssmiley and courteous , most services are available in english and french it is a good idea to get to use a few classic phrases in spanish as a number of waiters at the table and room mates speak spanish restaurantswe had no problem to make reservations for 6 dinners in restaurants (3 per week ) the garden grill , caf? de paris and el charro were excellent and the buffet was better than the 3 other we went to the buffet is well diversified from 10 am to 9 pm , tea , coffee , muffins and croissants were served on the terrace of the lobby bar the only place we found where the coffee was hot internet$12 usa for 30 cumulative minutes on 4/5 days good speed and many interesting options for laptop rentals cucarachaswe saw cockroaches or similar insects near and into restaurants , lobby , near the pool and a few feet from the door of our room roomgood size , the furniture is getting a bit old the cleaning of the room and the replacement of beverages was done properly at 50% of the time hair rinse and skin cream are not supplied about every day , sewage odours were present in the room , we had to pour water in the sink and bath tub to seal the drains out of 14 days , air conditioning was not cooling the room evening showswe saw 8 different shows then , it was a repeat pools and beachunless you have paid for a special club privileges only 2 pools are available they seem to be well maintained chairs at the pool and at the beach are comfortable but at times less than one per cent is available this is a huge resort , nice , clean and comfortable the food is good the service is uneven deficiencies in the room , uneven quality of service make it too expensive for the $ paid and consequently should not be rated 4 we have seen much better in 4 stars resorts 
nice resort , but not a true 5 star we have just returned from a 2 week stay at the grand bahia principe resort the resort is huge but well organised and you never have the impression that it is over - crowded despite +4000 guests staying there (1880 rooms the pools however do get very busy and many people have the nasty habit of reserving their space early in the morning the grounds are very well kept and all areas are very clean the staff is motivated grand bahia principe claims to be a 5 star resort but it is not it is a strong 4 star compared to other 5 star hotels you should not expect to pay for the safe , the pool at the spa , the toiletries are basic the gym is a real let down i tend to exercise daily and was looking forward to be able to do so during our stay the gym is small , dark and damp and way too small for the size of the resort the 2 rowers were broken , so was one of the treadmills and a few of the bikes despite reporting this to the manager nothing happened a lot has been written about the food we found the food choice to be better than in other all inclusives we stayed in the kitchen team do an incredible job at feeding thousands of people several times a day the food was not always warm but the vast choice compensated for this overall a positive experience but there is still room for improvement at the grand bahia principe to be able to claim the full 5 stars 
great decline in the last year this review is written by former fun of this resort , who sicerely recomended this place to friends now , i would be less enthusiastic about going there while this place is still ok , there was a big decline in the last year , especially food wise i was under impression that their food budget was cut at least on 50% instead of delicious sea food you have what you see chip , tasteless food , undercooked or dried out meet i found myself barely finding to eat something more or less decent nothing to compare 3 years ago i was also upset with some of front desk staff who were irresponsible , manipulating it 's time to lok for greener pastures 
way to big just back from punta cana at the bahia never again would i travel to this resort , after arriving 45 minutes early we were told that all our room keys had just been shipped to the airport so we would have to wait until they returned with them due to a medical condition we asked for a room closer to either the pool or beach , we even faxed in the request 2 weeks prior to getting there we think they looked for the room farthest from either of these and it took 3 days to get it changed i have to agree with bellamelissa in the previous review that the food really sucked my wife lived on eggs and pasta pretty much all week the beach and pool were packed at an early hour with towels on all the lounge chairs , but no people and if you watched some of those towels never even moved all day this resort is 5 resorts in 1 so it is pretty segregated if your a high end payer you can go anywhere and if your a low end be prepared for using only 2 out of 5 pools and half of food establishments some of the staff are very helpful but most really are not trying to pass the buck to someone else the cleaning staff do do a good job though they are always cleaning so all said our time there was alright but never would i reccomend this resort as it is to big and as i understand it is even expanding again to well over 2000 rooms 
do not bother ( stay next door ) stayed for a week at the end of november the bavaro section is the worst of resort the place is never a five star food is absolutely terrible not allowed to use the other 'practically empty ' pools but had to use the over - crowded main pools in my seven days i never saw them being cleaned even once the beach is ok but again overcrowded to make matters worse we have stayed previously at the riu bambu hotel that is next door everything about the riu is a step up yet costs less than this over - priced , over - developed 3 star butlins the one saving grace was the excellent enterainment and nightlife i guess that is where the resort spends all it 's cash - as it is definately not on the food ( the worst i have had anywhere in the world - everything and i mean everything is undercooked and luke warm ) 
nice resort we got a great deal on this resort through westjet vacations so i would have to say overall we had a great time for the money we paid the grounds are well kept the beach is beautiful and the pools are clean there were enough chairs by the pool and on the beach also lots of shaded areas the food was okay the al la carte restaurants were good , especially the gourmet restaurant the lobster bisque and the lobster main course was delicious we were impressed with the 5 star service at the gourmet restaurant because the service at the buffet and other restaurants were hit and miss our room was kept very clean we loved our maid she was so nice and friendly the resort is really big and we were lucky to have a room close to the beach if you are looking for room close the beach and pool area , ask for a room in the 25's or 23's our child is too young for the kids club but we took her to the mini disco that they have nightly at the main theatre she really enjoyed all the dancing they were quite good for resort entertainment 
we stayed at the bahia principe punta cana from nov 15-22 and overall it was a great vacation we updated do the golden club which i would not recommend because you paid $120 extra per person and really the one differentiator was getting the free 15 mins a day of internet use , if u dont value that then dont go for this lam upgrade pros : service - i thought the service was amazing for the most part the wait staff at the buffet were by far the best at the resort and pretty amazing they didnt speak a word of english but were sweet however , the women in the gift shops were pure evil and should not be employed in customer service , they were very rudepool - the pools were great , great atmosphere , hot bright sun and the drinks and food were close by it was hard to find a seat in the shade though and water was sometimes way too cold but heybeach - beautiful the sand was white and waters clear and blue the waves were a bit wild and it was very windy at the beach which was a turnoff i always said if theres a beach , y would anyone ever go to a pool that was answered at this resort as the pool was not windy and the beach had too many wavesgrounds - beautiful , well maintained and huge property had to take trams back and forth which was annoying , esp if it was raining out which it did for 2 straight days so if u wanted to eat u were foreced to get out in the rain and take the tram to get some food which was quite nasty in the rain food - i thought the food and a la cartes were quite good mexican was by far the best italian had great lasagna and steakhouse was good but staff not as nice buffet had a variety and i had food posining on the flight back but hey entertainment shows - i really loved these esp the micheal jackson and musical legend the tropicana dancers were not as good as cuba but they were all rightcons : service of females working in the lobby gift shops pleaserough waves and wind on the beachoverall great 
great resort , but not great food stayed for one week nov the resortthe resort was nice with very well manicured grounds we have stayed at the bahia principe in mexico which we loved and that influenced our decision to book this one our room was acceptable , although it may have been a bit moldy the bed was hard and the pillows are wafer thin not the best room i 've had although the beach was gorgeous ( like icing sugar ) , i would choose not to return to the dr again simply because of the food the foodhaving stayed at several 5 star resorts on different carribbean islands , i have to say this was my least favourite on average the food here was just not up to par with others we 've stayed at we have never experienced being sick while away before and both my husband and i had to use all our immodium , despite being careful to always use bottled water to brush our teeth , etc i guess maybe it 's hard to avoid as they probalby use unbottled water to wash the food , etc they had a lot of choices on the buffet , but i did not find a lot that i really enjoyed bacon hard to come by in the morning and it 's hardly cooked a la cartes : we booked the mexican - very good actually the appetizer buffet had lots of choice and was good much better than the mexican themed night at the buffet i was full by the time my main course came we also booked the gourmet restaurant we could only get into the late seating at 9:30 at night , but it was excellent my lobster bisque was great my lobster entre? also fantastic lastly we booked the japanese the food was good , but i 've been to a few other japanese restaurants like this at other resorts and this one sucked the cook put on absolutely no show at all what we liked  did not likethe resort was what i expected lots of pool areas a huge one right by the beach with a pool bar , children 's area , places for volleyball , etc lots of chairs and we never had a problem finding some in the shade , even getting to the pool usually after 10am this is where we hung out lots of bars , food , etc learn a few key phrases in spanish i found there was a language barrier with a lot of the service staff in restaurants and bars you could order the same drink all the time and get 5 different versions of it they did have a couple of waitresses around the pool , who i tipped i also tipped $5 at the a la carte restaurants , $10 at the gourmet i left $1 for my maid every day the one day i did not , we got no towels we arrived very late , so we did not get the reception i saw other buses get ( dancers and drinks ) in fact , the guy at the front desk would not give me a key to the room safe because he was too busy to fill out the paperwork , come back later tonight there was nobody else in line behind us and it was already 11:30, but i was not coming down later after travelling all day i went to reception in the morning my opinion is that this should be included with your stay and not have to pay an extra $4/day we did have a problem with our safe malfunctioning which maintenance had to replace the battery after calling and he was coming right away and did not come after 1 5 hours , i told them to forget it i called later that afternoon and then they did send someone right away we did not leave until 7:30 at night , but had to check out at noon the hospitality facilities were fine and we had easy access to our luggage that they stored you have to use the public washroom in which there are 3 showers in the back i then used one of the stalls to change the entertainment is your typical resort shows with some really good dancing and some really bad we actually ended up skipping it most nights and did not even make it to the entertainment complex for the disco or the band trains came every few minutes or less no waiting or hassle there so , bottom line i would book the bahia principe in mayan riviera rather than punta cana the resort i think is better there and the food definitely was 
decent place huge place , awesome grounds great transportation service within the grounds it took us a day to find out where to book the a la carte 's , by then everything was booked like for the week , they have to work on that one , we only could get the japanese which was aswesome , and the italian which was not even edible close that one up folks the food was not great at all , was not crappy either , just food all in all it 's a nice resort , real clean , do yourself a favor and learn spanish , as the only people who can speak english are the bartenders @ the pools and beach , and the people who work in the room where you book your meals , even most of the guests are spanish , tough to communicate i would return to this one , overall pretty good 
great resort , beautiful grounds , busy beach here are the positives about this resort the grounds are beautiful , very lush and green , huge open lobby , nice pools , one large one that is very loud and busy , and then another one that is large and nice and has a few activities michael jackson show is awesome rooms are big and the bathroom and tub are great the transportation that takes you from your room to the beach and the restaurants you wont wait more than 10 seconds for it the staff are all very nice and service is good the breakfast buffet is very good and has lots of selection the steak house is great grill ) here are the cons maid didnt come for two days at all one time to our room have to have a towel card for your towels make sure your towel doesnt get stolen there is alot of upselling at this resort lots of pricelists for many drinks that arent included , always a note at dinner that the wine recommended isnt included , and they have signs to get you to upgrade your room plus the safe costs 35 00the beach is ridiculous there are literally about 500 beach chairs all over the place and the water is really currenty and rough i was scared to go in although the beach is nice and the water a nice color and you can take a nice walk at night this beach looks like honolulu to me and the safe isnt included that is bad for a 5 star resort you are protecting yourself against the cleaning people having a safe and they make you pay for it i have never ever heard of this before we paid for the royal golden section and it still wasnt included which is a complete burn at the royal golden you get 15 min on the internet and they dont trust you and have to sign you in i felt like a school kid i enjoyed the food , the resort is gorgeous , the staff nice oh i forgot to mention how rude and unwelcoming the check instaff in royal golden were oh my god she never welcomed us told us the safe costs 35 00, wouldnt help us book restaurants , told us to come back even though we were in the time stated you were allowed to do so , and at the end said oh here is your welcome drink and handed us warm orange juice as we were leaving i would recommend this i would definitely recommend ambar over royal golden you get turndown each night but best of all you get a private pool for that section with no kids they keep advertising it is 15 00 to upgrade so i am guessing it is 210 extra per couple i think we paid more to have golden so we got burned email me if you like reenak@shaw 
a 5 star place ranked by local standards though you have to keep an open mind that this country is a 3rd world and therefore standards are not the same as we would typically expect back home ambar is part of the gran bahia complex that has gran bahia bavaro ( the biggest complex ) and gran bahia punta cana there is yet another complex just being finished called premier the latter is so far from the beach though bavaro has by far the most villas , many certainly not walking distance to the beach it also caters to families in fact there are little trains to take one across the complex the train does come to ambar also so you can go to the other complexes ambar has the villas nearest the beach and walking distance none really have beach views though you will get a nice pool view and partial beach one if you get to be in villas 67 or 60 amabr is of course adults only we stayed here for 2 weeks the welcome was warm and even though check in is 3pm , we got our room 12 30pm which was nice the rooms are very clean , spacious and cosy the bathroom certainly was well laid out also they give you a mini bar that comes with the all - inclusive they normally fill it up every day and is free the maids do start to work outside around 8,30am and they scrub the tilled floors which does make some noise with night life ending here 11pm every night , you tend to go to bed early , unless you venture over to bavaro the latter has a daily show from 9 45pm - 10 the michael jackson show on a monday night is pretty neat they also have an ok circus show on thursdays this area is a covered , but open theatre with lots of smokers you can then move to the outside band area that goes until 12am you also have the disco that goes to 2am one headache we found is the attire one needs in ambar for breakfast and lunch guys have to wear t - shirts or sleeved shirts though can get in with shorts in the evenings guys have to have full length pants i tried with capris and was told to change women at the pool/beach restaurant must be covered from waist down to eat here you will need a wrap around or shorts guys are ok wandering in with swim shorts only no top is needed this gets tiring especially when you are in warm climate with the buffet in bavaro and punta cana complexes , shorts are ok for guys in the evenings , though no tank tops anywhere any time all buffets are the same each evening everywhere and have themes , eg mexican , oriental , etc all la cartes can be booked at guest services don pablo was by far the best and you need to be dressed up to get in el olivio , their mediterranean restaurant was terrible , we walked out the food was so bad equally as bad in bavaro was pescador maika , the japanese place in bavaro was great teppanyaki and the sushi was not all that bad buffets had very good variety and quality was pretty good we never went hungry though its gets tiring for 2 weeks good thing is there is no smoking in any restaurant the lobby bar in ambar is also no smoking , but elsewhere it is allowed nice drinks to try are coco loco , a coconut/rum cocktail service was mostly pleasant though there is an element of pretentiousness here the hotel dings you for everything make sure you bring enough suncreen or you will need to buy it here for about $33, literally , per bottle beach was beautiful with ample chairs to lie down on september had 35% occupancy pool area typically had the chairs occupied under the umbrellas , otherwise lots left to bake in the sun you get a pillow menu that features scented pillows we got chamomile pillows which smelled nice at first , though were so strong we had to send them back they impregnated the room with their smell for a few days later we had a late checkout as our plane was 9pm saturday night they actually charge you $15 us per extra hour that you stay over that drew a sore thumb be cautioned about some of the tours that can be made in the bavaro side the dolphin swim one is $110 us each and gives you about 10-15 minutes of interaction with them in a group this was a rip off you will really enjoy the sea lion swim at half the price some days around the pools you can get your picture taken with parrots and a monkey $10 per picture 
good , but definitely not a five star i noticed , before i booked the resort , that the posted reviews which were considered most helpful by readers were very positive , and those which were less than glowing were generally considered unhelpful now that i 've just returned , i find that interesting , because i responded best to the sunny reviews and made my decision based on those who had a great time and loved the place i guess one finds what one 's looking for if you 're bound to have a good time , you certainly will : the italian food is fantastic , the beach unbeatable compared to the few caribbean all - inclusives in which we 've stayed , however , i would not rate the bavaro a five star : the rooms and their amenities are fine , for example , but not luxurious ( the in - room entertainment was ( for us ) , weak , with an old tv , no remote , and certainly no movies , vcr , etc since it rained for much of the week , this mattered a bit we were bound to have a good time and we did , despite the indifferent service , and the lack of people to meet ( most of the guests are spanish , and we speak the language haltingly ) our view : go , but do not expect the best facilities , live entertainment , or service if you want to have a good time , you will ( despite the potential disappointments ) and bring good reading material as there is none on the resort btw , the bananarama drinks are completely addictive 
watch your belongings we are a family of 3 ( with a 5 year old ) and have spent 8 days in gran bahia principe , punta cana part , in august and actually we liked the room , the beach and the friendly staff but at the end , it was our worst hotel experience ever , as we were treated in a really rude , unprofessional and not exactly guest - friendly way our room was comfortable and nice size , however the air - conditioner was not working properly the friendly lady from public relations promised to send a technician to our room they 've never fixed the air conditioner , but something else happened my husband took his laptop briefcas on vacation with him he is a busy profesional and has to check his e - mails often the briefcase had 2 locks with security codes laptop was on the desk , and briefcase was closed with both locks , but practically empty , containing just few business related papers , since we deposited all our valuables in a room safe ( for a charge of $35) three days before leaving the hotel , we noticed that someone deliberately opened the briefcase by breaking both security locks fortunately nothing has been stolen ( there was nothing inside ) , but the $250 briefcase was useless we immediately reported it to public relations , and they told us that they will open an investigation and that they have the possibility to check who entered the room after various phonecalls they offered us free massage , but after beeing told that we just want compensation for the vandalized briefcase , that actually told us , they ca not pay for it , because no one entered the room my husband demanded to talk to a manager and met mr julio pena , resident manager of punta cana hotel and tried to explain him the situation he would not listen and told him : - sir , you are wrong , they must have broken it at the airport with the other words , he tried to portray us as liars who want to cheat as we returned home , we contacted hotel management once again , who at least , made an effort in answering our letter and telling us that they were doing all the possible , but at the end kept the same attitude my advise to you : do not go to this hotel or if you go , watch your belongings , because if something happens , there will definitely be no one in this hotel , who will take your side and there will be no one there who would try to help you in that kind of situation we , for our part , left this hotel , deeply disappointed and outraged and will definitely never go back 
wonderful vacation in punta cana after reading all the mixed reviews , some petty in my opinion , some just blatantly unfair and not worth considering really i would like to add my two cents worth ( which is 1 5 cents us actually ) i just got back from spending a week at the bahia principe hotel in punta cana , with my family , ( wife and kids 21, 19, and 16 ) from august 16-24, 2008 had a great time , what fault can you find by getting up every morning and spending a day on a beautiful beach with great weather we left toronto on air canada flight was great , on time , smooth and the aircraft had the personal , on demand , entertainment console which really helps to pass the time after we picked up our luggage at punta cana airport , we went to the exit , we were swarmed a bit by the porters , but we just firmly said ??o thanks? and walked toward the hotel transfer buses this is one part that was kind of confusing , we were told to get bus 22, by the conquest agent and we headed toward the bus area , but couldn?? find the bus , several bus drivers were helpful and directed us but they didn?? seem to know where the bus was either i guess all the bus drivers are privately owned and are taking care of their own passengers after going up and down the lines of buses three times , we found it in the end , and then they changed the bus , it is the caribbean i suppose , but i think some kind of parking lot number or markers might help it took about 45 minutes to get to the hotel , it was dark at the time and the roads are pretty bumpy with some major pot holes , first sign that you are not the land of plenty , unless you are going to the hotels hotel check in was pretty fast , the lobby is spectacular , we did read previous reviews regarding the safe charge , so we booked the safe at the same time , i read that someone claimed they had money stolen from their room , why take these kind of chances for three dollars a day , not really worth it , is it , crime is everywhere including where i live the front desk also recommended that we book our ala cart restaurants at guest services the following morning , we had read in the reviews that it was good idea to do it early on , which we did , we got all the times and dates we asked for , it took about five minutes , then we went for breakfast , followed by a visit to the beach , well we were on vacation we were driven to our room by the baggage guys , they took our cases up to the rooms , we asked for adjoining rooms , we got it , the rooms were immaculate and spacious the maids left the place spotless everyday with fresh towels , bottles of water etc our ac unit worked better than the kids room , we did get some difficulty with the keys losing their programming and not working , had to go to the desk three times over the vacation to get them reprogrammed i would say this is the first time in any of my travels where english was not as widely spoken , i found , a lot of the hotel clientele was from south america and spain , but we did seem to get by with basic spanish terms , at least we tried and they seemed to appreciate it the grounds of the complex are beautifully kept and maintained , the resort is pretty big , but it has a tram service which is pretty straight forward and runs frequently every 5-10 minutes or so the beach was stunning and the ocean was so refreshing , the weather was hot the pools were massive , i did notice that as the day wore on the pools really warmed up and didn?? really in we ate at the buffet every morning , wide variety for breakfast service with fresh egg and omelet stations , pancakes , bacon , sausages , fresh fruit , fresh breads we ate lunch at the buffet and the snack bar on the beach , buffet had better variety bur the snack bar was handy and the pizza was pretty good , weren?? too fond of the burgers in the dominican thoughwe ate at the buffet for dinner on three nights and had our ala cart restaurants on the other nights the buffet has a wide choice with themed nights , i dominican , mexican and oriental , my only complaint about the buffet dinners were that the meat wasn?? to my taste really and a lot of the dishes were a bit on the bland side for my taste the ala cart we chose were the japanese , french and the steakhouse all of the restaurants were better than i was expecting and a nice change , considering it was included made it even better weather was absolutely glorious , seven days of sunshine , one night of rain ( torrential ) for half an hour that was it verdict : i would thoroughly recommend this resort it certainly was great value for the money i paid c$1,200 00 pp for this vacation , with flight , accommodation and meals for a week , pretty good i think , it?? not a five star ritz carlton type of hotel , but your not paying those five star prices either hope this helps 
hot and sick my family vacation of four was from 8/11/2008 to 8/18/2008 we had 2 junior suites one room had a king size bed and the other room had two double beds it was very hot and humid in punta cana the a/c in the rooms didn?? do justice for the heat we needed to ask for extra towels every day getting in and out of the shower was a big step i got sick with diarrhea from the food at the mexican restaurant i went to the 24 hr medic that is on site after many complaints they picked up the tab for the doctor bill making reservations for the 3 restaurants was not convenient times the staff was friendly but very little english 
beware - - - not for non spanish speaking people the hotel premises are beautiful very large hotel that is supposed to be a five star but they do not even have irons in the room we had several problems during our stay and unfortanetly this hotel lacks custumer service they do not address issues at all first , check in was fine until we walked to our room big no no take the trolley when we got to our room we found one large king bed for my father , myself and my son after going backt o the front desk we were told they were completely booked and we would be able to change our room the following day despite waiting two hours in the lobby for them to come back and tell us they were booked five minutes later we went to make reservations for the three restaurants and our options were extremely limited due to the hotel being full to capacity they were not flexible with times or dates while making the third reservation we were told our room had changed even though they had just sad they were sold out so back to lobby room was large but full of mosquitoes despite having rom sprayed daily night was spent killing them travelled with a three year old and restaurant s re not eqipped to cater to their needs hotel does not have any room sevice and restaurants do not allow you to take food out i hated begging people to give me something to wrap up food for my son that was sleeping in the stroller at dinner in the buffet they do not have styrofoam trays to accomodate the needs of toddlers ad with no 24 hour snack bar this is not a family oriented hotel inthe restaurants they wrapped up a pizza one night and the other night they wrapped an entire kids meal so why can they do it in the restaurants but not int he buffet at the french restaurant i had the worse lobster ever it was so bad but my dad loved his rack of lamb italian was fine except that the red snapper was overcooked and they serve the tiniest piece starters were really good at italian garden grill was good meat was tasty i had the filet and i ordered it medium which was served well overall not the best place for gourmet food i hve had much better i travel alot and have never written a review but am writing this one because so many things are lacking at this hotel the hotel does not cater to english speaking guests no one speaks english this was very frustrating since i was was with my son many restaurants lacked ice during breakfast and lunch and i had a huge problem during meals when you get up from your table they clear your food well i would go and get food with my son and then place the frsh plates onthe table next we would go get drinks well many times i returned to find my fresh plates of food gone this was so annoying and one day my son yelled at a lady and said stop takling my food they need some kind of stop/go sign on these tables this was really bad at the snack bar by the beach because they are in such a rush to clear the tables room service was fine and they even did a ballon arrangement for my son on one day but never left three bath towels soda machine by thte pool never worked ramon was great - - he really tried to make my son happy and was pretty good in attending to our needs on aug 12 we had a very unfortanate experience the pool /towel guy who does aerobics ( the skinny one i think iskal or soemthing like that ) is very loud and gets the crowd going there was a large crowd from spain by the bar and the worker kept cheering them on they were cursing , degrading women and really getting out of hand he kept giving them hi fives , gave them his microphone , the wigs and his orange whistle he was allowing for their innapropriate behavior at the pool despite the fact that their were kids during aerobics he too was fresh and his idea of fun was grabbing his privates and so forth so these guest went to mimic his actions but undid their swim suits and were pulling out their privates my father told them to stop but this worker told them to keep on when asked his name so we could report him he refused and covered his name tag an hour later another guest removed his full bottoms right alongside the pool and begain making inappropriate gestures , i immediately told workers to call security and despute security the nonsense continued they were removed from the pool only to retunr two hours later i nor my son or anyone there should have been subjected to that the situation should have been handled after my father reported it the first time but this worker who was also drinking all day everyday kept this going he encouraged it and to drink and carryon with them when it happened the second time ramon assisted in getting security but the hotel did not address this properly that man should not have been allowed back at the pool i am trying to contactt the owners of this resort for an immediate response to the issues but have been unsuccessful 
we just returned from a weeks vacation and had a great time we loved the set - up of the hotel - it had the feel of a village and the landscaping wha beatuiful the beach was so clean and the bars and restaurants were great the food was not the best but there was a great variety so there was no problem finding something for everyone the lobby was spacious and beautiful , pools were very clean , rooms were large and comfortable we have 3 boys : 21, 19 and 12 and they shared a room and my husband and i had our own room it worked out perfectly and we felt that we were very safe and secure there is something for all ages and interests and i would go back right now if i could 
lock up your belonging horrible experience at bahia principe items and cash were stolen from our room and the hotel staff was absolutely no help whatsoever we were blamed for not locking the items in the safe , and even accused about lying about the theft itself i would not expect this kind of treatment at a 5 star hotel 
one of the worst vacations i have ever been on i just got back from this so - called 5 star resort i have never in my life been so disappointed in a hotel and resort we booked through bp travel usa and they absolutely did nothing to help us there was a young lady in guest relations that helped more than anyone we were not told that we had to make reservations for restaurants and that it had to be done by 3:00 p we finally figured this out a couple of days before we left the all - inclusive does not mean that you can eat at any buffet there was one that was 100 feet from our door that we could not use the property is huge the waiters and staff in the restaurants were good and the housekeeping service was good the property is beautiful and the pools are nice i would never recommend this resort to anyone , not even my worst enemy 
good and bad stayed on : 7/13/08 - 7/26/08family age : 47, 44, 37, 36, 23, 18, 15, 13, 12, 10, 4 i originally booked dreams resort punta cana but after reading all of the reviews and people getting sick and problems with crappy rooms i called my travel agent and changed it to bahia very big plain resort2 food just ok same but in different souse every day pool/beach bra closed at 5pm4 trolley gives out fumes/pollution pool very hot at 97f6 pool restaurant for lunch only : pasta , hot dogs  burgers if your far from beach you need to take a trolley restaurant service very slow w/soda/coffee/re - fills no attention/activities for ages 10-1610 entertainment just ok11 beach swimming area very small next to all the boats very clean resort2 maids do a great job ( did tip tho every day )3 any problems fixed asap rooms much bigger then standard no problem finding a chair at pool or beach at any time no huge lines at bars chek in/out very quick laura to get your room request she got us very close to the beach always stayed in much smaller resorts with much tropical surroundings exp : iberostar la hacienda la romana or iberostar tucan this resort is ok but i like them much smaller 
my review is late by ha lol we enjoyed our vacation , but we have stayed at several gran bahia hotels befor and found it allitle blaw as we knew what to expect flight was long , and there was not much direction as to how to get to the bus food was great room was excellent , we requested to be close to the beach so we were abit far away from everything else service was excellent only neg was no one served drinks at the pool our friends book at the priemer and had a private pool and resturant we did not so i would book priemer next time beach - we enjoyed it but we like diving and this is not a good beach for this we went to a shop ran by someone from montreal , it is free to go not a good place to get presents very costly , but nice the tents at the end of the beach has nice gifts at good prices we gave the guys at the water taxies pop and water and they gave us free rides do not go on jrassic buggie tour , take the other one , it was a great tour but you will never get your video u pay for several people had the same problem bar/disco way to many people at a small space , drinks are free but good luck with this overall this was a great place to stay but we found it to be expensive for gifts ect i like to buy friends and family gifts and at 20 us dollars a mug , 25 for a t shirt it adds up overall i enjoyed it but would not return a great trip 
july 20-27/08 not the best experience i went on a girls vacation with my sister and our friend to relax and unwind the ride from the airport was fine but finding the bus was rather confusing i have never had to wait in line to find out what bus is taking me to the resort a representative is always waiting with a huge sign to direct people , however this was not the case in punta cana we checked into our hotel on the bus which i found very convenient everything was ready ( wristbands , room keyes and towel cards ) so you just had to off load from the bus and go straight to your room we were unaware however that there was a punta cana side and a bavaro side ( no one explained that to us ) as we were walking around in circles the first night looking for the main restaurant just to be told to go around the corner everyday we had to go to the front desk to have the three keyes reprogrammed as they would deactivate for some reason we were told that if the key is next to anything electronic such as a camera or cell phone that the key would deactivate needless to say this was very annoying and a very uncomfortable experience the service for the most part was not acceptable the resort is beautiful but some of the workers were not friendly and at times very rude we found that the europeans were favoured and everyone else who paid their hard working money to come to the resort were pretty much ignored we went to watch the house band a couple of nights and found one of the waiters to be very rude he did not want to serve us and walked by us several times without asking us if we wanted something to drink apparently we looked to be dominican and although we do not speak spanish and the fact that we were wearing our yellow bands did not seem to matter much the food was good there was variety however the menu could have used a shake up on a couple of nights i did have the runs for a full day while down there my sister had the runs on our last day on the resort thank god for pepto bismal and graval did not like the fact that we had to check out of our room by 12pm and then had to hang out in the unbearably hot lobby for five hours there were no hospitality suites in this five star hotel our housekeeper isabel was very friendly , kept our room clean and smiled all the time eddy perez our conquest tour operator from hotelbeds was amazing and made us feel welcomed he was very friendly , knowledgeable and easy to talk to as he did speak and understood english i would not come back to this hotel because this is not a five star by any means there needs to be more english speaking people on staff and i think that the staff need to be trained on what it means and takes to give excellant customer service 
no way jose better i start with the good stuff the hotel is set in beautiful well kept grounds , the gardening staff headcount must be enormous , since its truely well kept the room ( after tipping the check in clerk $20) was set in the middle of the resort , and for us a family of 2 adults and a 6yr old , was perfectly placed to access the beach area and main area with a 5 min walk to either , or bus ride it was well maintained , large , clean and kept clean since we tipped the maid $3 per day , so had no problems here at all ( comparedto some other reviews ) in fact the maids were very smiley ( bear in mind we heard from a former worker who now sells goods on the beach that average pay is $150 per month , so i guess we greatly subsidised her monthly income , and she looked genuinely sad when we left ) this is where the good stuff ends all rude , spanish speaking and unfreindly im not snobbish , but dont expect to be called 'my friend by someone pouring water into my glass , nor does my wife like being shouted at by waiters with a 'hey nor do we appreciate them saying where are you from , you are pretty nor do we like being told to wait for a table , when the main restaurant is only 1/4 full , nor do we like having plates snatched away as soon as you rest the fork on it service generally was poor if you like ultra sweet drinks then this all inclusive resort is for you i mean sweet like full sugar fruit concentrate mixed with ice the best cocktails were at the lobby bar , forget drinking at the beach or pool bar unless you want to gain 10 kilos over 2 weeks , not to mention visit the dentist for tooth rot on your return asking for special more sour cocktails only got wierd looks from the barman and when we managed to get him to make one , i wasnt suprised to see other people start asking for it , so they cunningly ran out of the main ingredients quickly to stop this revolution on the drinks in the restaurant dont expect to get more than one or two at most glasses of wine per meal if youre lucky service is purposely slow in the main square where entertainment after 930pm is dont expect to get more than one cocktail so if youre looking to go out and get sloshed it wont happen unless one drink will send you over the edge sadly it takes more than that to get me dizzy so i felt almost as if i spent the holiday on the wagon ok theyre big but bear in mind that they all have pool bars ( bars where you sit in the water at the bar ) and people stay at them all day drinking i have to say i saw few getting out to go to the loo , and it was the impression of many that it was normal to pee in the pool in fact i saw one latin child standing at the side of the pool , peeing directly into it no one thought to stop him , and certainly no parent admonished him during our two weeks the main pool was closed due to someone taking a dump in the pool clean and tidy generally but you have to be up and reserving your chosen sunbeds by 0730 or youre going to be left either miles away , or in permanent shade or permanent full sunshine the last two days we saw oil slicks floating on the sea as the multitude of motor boats dripped oil not nice at all ( proper oil slicks , black ones , not smatterings of sun lotion unadventurous , repetative , often off , or rotting , meat chewy and either under cooked or over cooked salad often sitting for hours drinks over sweet water based concentrate mix we saw several people with food poisoning , luckily my stomach is strong , even though i did have the runs ' on the last few days the other guests were mostly spanish or hispanic , and a real mix clearly the european contingent paid a bit more to get there , and the central american paid less , and it showed in the style and behaviour of the guests personally i felt a bit uncomfortable sitting next to hollywood stereotypical street gangstas at dinner tatoos from head to foot , baseball hats , baggy pants , and diamond and gold bling bling jewelry the only thing they lacked were guns the one worth doing was the high sea fishing run by gone fishing $92 per person for 4 hours we hooked two marlins and landed a third no way jose 
watch what you eat if you 're looking for a 5 star hotel according to dominican standards this is it but it 's not the four seasons if you 're american , it is not a 5 star according to american standards , but it is very nice i would have rated this resort excellent however i 'm writing this review 4 days after our stay in my traveling group were myself , my brother and my 15 year old child for the past 2 days both of them have had to be treated for amoebas that they contracted through the resort food be careful in your choice of what you eat the food is good and the restaurants look very clean , however our doctor is positive that raw vegetables are what caused my family to have amoebas i was the only one who chose not to eat any raw vegetables and i 'm fine unless you want to start taking some serious medications and experience horrible diarhea and vomitting do not eat the raw vegetables although you 're on vacation keep in mind that this is still the dominican republic the health  cleanliness requirements are not the same standards as in the states the hotel room was excellent  facilities great staff works hard the beach is excellent and we loved our trip it was the after effects that we hated 
as a single mother of two teenagers , i decided to treat the family to a family vacation i have travelled previously with my late husband to many destinations and know when a hotel deserves to be considered a 5 star hotel everything went smooth with the flight and the check - in if you love huge resorts than this is the one for you the resort has a trolley which runs from 7am to 3 am personnally i would have liked a smaller , more intimate resort if you were at either end of the trolley 's route than you should consider yourself lucky since it fills up quickly and anyone at other stops in between will have to wait to get a seat the staff are not friendly actually they act as if you are disturbiing them not to many smiling faces i found this a bit unpleasant as it creates a very ackward bad ambiance what i found very agitating is the fact that the staff did not speak any english , which makes it hard to ask for things only some knew basic words of english i knew the resort was family oriented but did not know up to what point there were babies everywhere i could not move without stumbling on a carriage the crying and tantrums were very agitating considering i was looking to unwind so for those of you who are looking for peace and quiet the food was edible and there was variety what i did not like was that the main dining area was too dark and extremely hot since there was no air condition as you enter , there is a woman who looks as if she would rather be having her teeth pulled than to take you to your table when she does show you to the table you are guaranteed the tour of the dining area before she seats you in a dark corner i always wondered what determined my seating area since i was early and the place was empty the one time i asked to be seated in a more open area she got upset i was surprised one morning to find that the hotel ran out of jam and when i asked if there was any they had 5 men running around not knowing what i wanted needless to say i finally was told by someone that they ran out and to make do with other stuff this is not a 5 star resort the first couple of days of my stay i got good room service after that it was all downhill i had to call to get my room cleaned one of the days i called i got this big knock on the door i opened the door to get greeted by this very furious woman who shouted at me  servicio she then went on to ask if i spoke spanish which i replied no abla espangnol she stormed in the room ( i am not exagerating ) tossed the bed forward to rip the sheets off the bed threw them violently on the floor and proceeded to kick my luggage since i imagine must have been in her way and all the while giving me looks that would kill she then continued in the bathroom as i got on the balcony so not to get in her way i saw her several times going in and out and i am sure she was swearing in spanish to her coworker who was doing my sons room at one point she enters the room with a mop and starts going at it like a mad woman , hitting anything in her way instead of lifting or tossing things aside as she finished by going towards the door she glanced over and slammed the door at that point i lost it and ran to the door and told her to calm herself she just stood there with 3 other women laughing and speaking spanish i am saving the best for last when i arrived at the hotel , as everyone does , i started putting my combination into the vault after several tries i informed the front desk that it didnt work only to be told that i had to pay 36 us per week for the safe i was shocked that a 5 star hotel didnt include it with the package since i never before had to pay for it i refused to do so and reasoned that the staff wouldnt take anything since if they did they would lose their jobs they stole 50 00$ from my wallet thinking i wouldnt notice when i saw that i immediately asked my sons friend , who came along with us to check his wallet he too was missing money , 20 i reported it to the guest services only to have a night manager come to the room to investigate the area , jot down some notes and tell me that it took 48 hrs before they get back to me as i was supposedly at a 5 star hotel , i inquired 2 days before if i can get a hospitality room for the day of departure since i had to check out for noon and i was only leaving the compound at 5pm , they told me that their hotel doesnt provide that service i have been to many 4 and 5 star hotels and would definitely not consider this one among them i am disappointed that i had to pay good money to take my 2 teenage sons on vacation as a single parent i dont want to sound mushy but this was a way to reconnect with my boys after their dad passed away in 2005 and instead ended up constantly agitated and sad that it was the worst week ever the thing that gets me is that i cannot afford to go on another family vacation to make up for the one that past 
not really a 5 star experience pluses - look of the resort , pool areas the rest is very questionable service is very bad , even rude at times ( restaurant la gourmet was the worst experience in all categories - never go there ) our check - in lasted almost 2 hours , full of mistakes and strange talks it is true - rooms are musty and our clothes smelled bad even after few washes room service was weird - they never got how many towels should be left in the room for 3 people sometimes we would have 1, sometimes none , sometimes only bath and none hand , but never all even worse - towels were sometimes old , dirty , torn it was an everyday chase after cleaning person if you need something ( any kind of service ) be patient '5 minutas ' means an hour or two in the restaurants service was almost non - existent they would not bring drinks , they would grab your plate before you had a chance to eat , there were no tea or coffee during lunch and dinner at the bar we noticed some interesting rule - they ignore women and respond much faster to men and do not even attempt to use their tennis courts - they look 20 years old and very slippery , not to mention cracks and holes gym is small but has most of what you might need spa is ok but message was mediocre and the whole lay - out is not very relaxing my friend and i booked separate treatments in advance but then to our surprise discovered that they put us in one room because they did not have empty ones after i refused to share and waited for 10 min the second room was found but they did not act happy and the treatment was cut short honestly , that was not at all what i expected from a 5 star place ( and i travel a lot ) food was better in quality and selection in a lobby restaurant only people who ate meat complained it was hard to chew fish i ate was good only on a few occasions but that could be forgiven if the service was at least somewhat present overall impression was that they really were not happy to see us there , did not bother to make things more pleasant and sometimes just ignored english will never go back and advised my friends against going there too we had 9 people in our group and all had similar feelings 
very nice , but not perfect i decided to write something helpful for the people who are planning to stay in this hotel as i had killed a lot of time on reading from this site and was shocked at the diversity of opinions thus i would try to be as objective and precise as possible the hotel is like a small town , but it is easy to get around ( if you are not a complete moran of course ) as you are given a map the transportation system is effective there are lots of parts and clubs there : premier ( futherst from the beach , secluded ) , bavaro and punta cana sides are mirrow reflections of each other , golden club ( closest to the sea ) , ambar ( the newest part , close to the see ) and so on my girlfriend and i booked golden club , but got upgraded to ambar , which was very lucky as being in ambar you can use all the facilities and restaurants of other parts , but no outside can use yours what a feel of exclusiveness besides ambar is adults only othewise there is almost no difference where you live now there is a construction next to punta cana reception and along the bavaro side , mind not to get there - all the other places are ok some of the staff speak adequate english , at least one person at the reception and head waiters you should not expect the others to do so the territory is beautiful and very clean , the beach is great , though there was a bit of sea weed sometimes , but it is safe the room was ok , no bugs seen in ten days you have to pay for the safe 3-4 $ per day the food is good , if macdonalds is not the corner stone of your diet we went to 4 restaurants and found out that our ambar buffet was better than any of them as it had more variety for those who enjoy seafood can recommend pescador ( fisherman ) ca not say anything about bavaro and punta cana buffets cause we did not eat there snack bar is ok mind that you need to have trousers for dinner and shorts for the snack bar as for entertainment : there are nightly shows and the corcert hall is always packed ( i could not make myself to watch them for more than 10 minutes though ) there are some watersports , but they are not free ( as you have to pay insurance ) and some other stuff of no importance we entertained ouselves hope my review will help you to make your decision 
" this is not a 5 star report " my name is greg and i just returned from the grand bahai principe bavaro in the dominican republic we did a lot of checking on this resort before hand to ensure we would be satified my girlfriend and i are very experienced travellers and have been all over the carribean and have stayed at 3, 4 and 5 star resorts we left on july 11, 2008 on our trip with signature vacations and skyservice airlines nice flght down and no issues with immigration getting into the country i was in the dominican about 20 years ago and stayed in sosua but this was not a 3 star resort the bahai was ranked as a 5 star resort and that 's what cought our eye when booking we arrived at the resort around 10:30 at night check in service was quick and organized as you may or may not knwo this resort is huge and they use tram cars to get you from one end to another we were as far away from the main lobby as you could get which i was happy with in saying this the porter took our bags up to the third floor and when he swipped the room card in the door , it did not work , neither of them worked the porter spoke not one word of english , he just left and returned about 30 min later , it was black and we had no clue how we ever got to our room so we just waited little pissed off and tired at this point but it is what it is we got in the room and it was beautiful , king size bed , chairs , couch etc nice shower with jet tub and all the fancy tile we threw our bags on in the room and went to the front lobby for a drink it 's about 11:10 right now and we get to the bar and the guy is standing there and tell us he is closed and we have to go to the (1) bar that is now open in the outdoor court all inclusive closing bars at 11:00 pm on a 5 start reportso we go the main outdoor court and we sat for 35 min and not one person came to take our order so we left so you know you ca not get you 're own drinks here , you have to wait to be served and you have to be sitting at a table back to the room to sleep , wake up hit the biffet and meet our signature rep to get the lowdown on the resort we were told many things by her and then going back to speak to her a few days after she said she never said those things for you people looking to book the amber side fo the resort for the 1 extra al la carte and the privacy , save your money we spoke to an english couple with out signature rep who were staying on the amber side which gives then access to everything this resosrt has , they mentioned that they went to the bavaro buffet the previous night and they were denied they asked why becasue they paid extra to have this privilege and the signature rep said sometime they deny people from amber and sometimes they do not the man had rage but held it in until we all left foodi am not the only person who will say this to you and please trust me on this the food that is served on this entire resort is not 5 star quality , it is not even 4 star quality at the very most , 3 start quality i am speaking the truth here meat , terrible , fried on a skilletchicken , boneless fried on a skilletpasta , every day for every mealveg , rice , egg plant and potatosushi , had at the buffet and you could get the same at any chinese placethe buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner was a complete free for all everyday , food everywhere on the floors and messy al la cartei hate to say this but again 3 star quality , good service , food terrible beach , best part of the resort , nice waves , lost of chairs on the beach and great to walk up and down the coast to view the other resort there lots of boats that gave off a gas smell onthe beach however so if this would bother you , again stay away the resort itself was beautifully landscaped and cleaned constantly on the resort we used an outside provider in the outside court for email to check on things at home this is you 're only option given unless you upgrade to diamond status 12 bucks american for one hour we used it twice , nice clean place with about 8 dell laptops went back on our 3rd , 4th and 5th day and the computers were all down i said to the guy , call you 're owner and tell him that i bought one hour worth of service , i had 30 min remaning and i want 6 dollar back because i am leaving the next day and their service is not acceptable he called , got off the phone and looked at me and said no refund , i ca not help you i made sure i told him to tell his owner that this is not acceptable and i would ensure to write about this on my review i found out from another couple that this is very common at this place and it is done to save money so if you use it and it happens to you , do not say i didn 'e tell you drinks/bars1- beach bar ( so busy you could barely get a drink ) opens at 10am and closes at 5pm 2- pool swim up bars ( people claim pool stools and do not move ) opens at 10am and closes at 5 pm 2 - bars beside the pool opens at 10 am and closes at 5pm 1- bar in the main lobby opens at 10am and closed at 11pm after that you have to sit with over a thousand people and fight to wait for a drink in the ourdoor court are , might as well go back to you 're room at that stage again not 5 star qualityhere is the kicker , all those fun drinks we all get when we are down in the islands and drink like fishes , if you do not ask for booze in your drink they will give you a virgin drink i am not kidding have you ever heard of such a thing brutal and not 5 star qualitymy overall comments about this place would be to book elsewhere for me i am never going back to the dominican again i gave this a shot becasue of all the negative light that is being shed on mexico these days i was hoping to get lucky and i wish i would have went back to the mayan riviera at the very least my review is not to slander the resort itself , it 's food , it 's service , it is only to speak the truth in saying this is very far away from being a 5 star resort on almost all services hope this review helps you finding a great vacation desitny regards , greg 
we just got back from gran bahia principe punta cana we were there for one week i had a lot expectations about this resort however i was very disappointed with the experience i 've been 4 times in punta cana in other resorts ( riu , barcelo 's , etc ) and i have to say that bahia has the worst food i ever had the buffet at orquidea is very limited , every day same food they just change the name an a few things no seafood , only one type of fish beef is terrible they cook terrible very limited in fruits drinks are made with cheap licors , no brand names breakfast is ok , but sometimes you ca not even find bacon we tried several restaurant and they were low quality the japanese was a little better , but far from real japanese food they did not have chop stick beach it was great , like any resort at bavaro beach the pueblo is nice ( disco , casino , bar , shopping ) we liked to shop there but keep in mind you must negotiate to get good prices resort is very nice and rooms are beautiful , but take your own pillow one more thing i have to say : no volvere eh eh , no volvere eh eh a bahia principe 
worst experience ever here is an excerpt from the email i sent when i returned from my trip : i am writing to attempt to express my displeasure with my recent stay at your resort i purposely waited a few days to send this email because i wanted my anger to subside and i needed to get some rest my accommodations consisted of adjoining rooms in the royal golden principe for 4 nights my situation is that i am a single dad with twin 8 year old girls and i traveled with my girlfriend and she has a 17 year old son who occupied the adjoining room it was my first trip away with my girls and my gf and her son and it was very important to me it must be noted that she has a background in the travel industry and researched the different properties and felt it was important , considering the situation , to spend a little more to ensure a great vacation collectively we have traveled to over 15 islands and our only other experience in the dominican republic was a great one in may of 2006 at the secrets resort it will not be easy but i will try my best to keep this as brief as possible on the drive to the resort everyone was excited and the entry was totally disappointing due to the construction in the main lobby having been to many of the islands in the caribbean i was waiting for the warm , friendly greeting and a refreshing cocktail and it did not happen we were simply directed to golden club and waited for the next available staff member immediately i became concerned because the gentleman seemed almost annoyed to check us in and gave us little to no information regarding the resort we got absolutely no direction regarding the difference of being in the golden club versus the rest of the property simple questions such as what hours are you open how can we get access to the internet is not premium alcohol served here , as advertised how do we get a drink , there is no bartender at that point we are told we need to pay to get a safe are you kidding me i then ask about the reservations for the special restaurants and i am told i need to come back the next day to make them we are then taken to our rooms , after looking at the map and trying to figure out where the beach and pools are we walk around and try to get situated after unpacking we head to the buffet let me clarify that we attempt to head to the buffet we have absolutely no idea where we are going and ca not get a straight answer from anyone working for the hotel after finally getting some dinner we head home to our room and get off at three different places without a clue of where we are before we find the room at this point the kids are actually scared and just want to go to bed after falling asleep , i wake up and realize the air conditioning is not working properly and when i turn on the lights i see two large cockroaches run in front of me i kill them and convince myself it is a one time thing and that the air is okay and i have a horrible nights sleep in the morning we , once again , have a hard time finding it back to the golden club to complain about the roaches and the air conditioning and to make our dinner reservations we are told that the problems would be corrected and that there is only two restaurants available on separate nights for dinner we end up actually making one of the reservations at 9:30 because it is all that is available then it just gets worse we head back to the room and upon entering start to realize that the cockroach problem is real i kill about 5 in each room in 10 minutes by the way , the two adults are trying to kill them without the children knowing at this point , i have absolutely had it and consider getting a flight home on the third sleepless night i actually had a bug crawl across my head as i stated earlier , as hard as it is i am trying to keep this short so i am simply going to list some of the other situations we encountered - garden grill , every order wrong and no more churrasco - towel service ridiculous , what is the service - no beach service for drinks - no proper air conditioning until 11pm on day 3 - total cockroach infestation that was never corrected - japanese restaurant with my 8 year old girls sleeping at the table when the food was served at 10:15 pm oh , i have to mention three other specific encounters i go to return my 5 towels on the last day to get my plastic cards and i am told that they only have 4 cards available i said i was checking out and i needed the cards and the response was , you will take what i have another really crazy situation was the last day when i tried to find out the status of my flight back to new jersey after being sent to 4 different people i was told that the hotel does not offer that service i actually called home to have somebody check for me lastly , upon checkout , i ask to see a manager because i have some major issues and i am told i have to wait because he is eating breakfast i did not sleep for 5 days and i have to wait for this guy to finish his breakfast needless to say , this was the worst trip i have ever been on 
my wife and i have just returned from gran bahia principe we were ther from 19th june until 3rd july and we went with 1st choice ( from now on to be our last choice ) flight overwe upgraded to premier classas a special treat seeing as i was 60 this year the brochure says you have priority boarding of the plane , this did not happen it was a free for all the plane was parked way out on the tarmac as far from the terminal as you could be and as soon as the doors opened to get on the buses it was a stampede the brochure also states the meals were desingned by aldo zilli , well if thats he 's ideas of decent food send him back to italy your also get the choice of 16 movies noway it was only 10 the cabin crew were helpful and polite though transfer to resortwe were booked in on the coach to the hotel by one of the reception staff which was helpful she gives information about the resort which is very misleading according to the 1st choice brochure you have 3 large pools to use , this is their first lie and it goes on from there do not believe all you read in the brochure hotelthe hotel is 2 large resorts joined together with 2 smaller parts attached the large ones are gran bahia principe bavaro and the other is gran bahia principe punta cana , in most repects they are mirror imaged but you are not allowed to share each others pools the brochure states you have all pools to use the resort is vast it took the wife and i an hour to walk around the perimeter the grounds and all areas are kept imacculate and the staff work very hard the beach is lovely but is restricked to a small swimming area the large pool at the beach end does not have enough sun shades so if you do not get there early enough you miss out on any shade for the day and belive me you wo not want to sit in the sun allday the staff are very friendly and helpful at all times and ca not do enough for you you do not have to tip but a dollar here and there is met with a lot of grattitude restrauntsthe main restraunt caters for all tastes and the food is nice plenty of fresh salad and hot meals of al sorts we only tried 3 of the 6 al a carte restraunts as i got a bad belly on the 6th day there and still have not shaken it of the garden grill was very good and the japanese was excellent the gourmet is what gave my bad belly as i had lobster and chicken fricasse and it did not taste that good , i 've had lobster many a time before and never tasted like that other holiday makersthe resort was full of every nationality you could think of we met one canadian couple from toronto who are from pakistani origin who were lovely but forgot to get their email address also a canadian couple from toronto ( christine and david ) with 2 sons ( mathew and michael ) who were lovely people christine helped me out with some stomach bug medication again we failed to get email address if you read this mine is tddavis@btinternet were a lot of yanks noisy and far over the top as usual the other canadians were more reserved as we have found at other resorts in the caribbean airport and flight homethe airport was hectic , they were booking in 9 or 10 flights at the same time and our rep did not have a clue what line we should be in it took over 1 hour to get from checkin to the depature lounge and it was hot and sticky no air con at all the flight home was ok until we got to gatwick we landed at 5:35 and had to park on the hard stand furthest from the terminal the ground staff who were in charge of manouvering the steps into place did not have a clue what they were doing , they eventually got the steps in and door open by 6am we were not allowed to disembark until 6:20 when the one and only bus arrived to take us to the terminal once at the terminal everthing went smoothly we have been on holiday to the north of the island twice before to playa dorada and will go back there again but never to gran bahia as it too big 
let me start by thanking all past guests at this resort for their valuable comments and feedback which , after much research , convinced me to pick this resort for my family vacation after all that i read about the gran bahia principe bavaro , i never expected to be prepared for what was waiting for us at check - in apparently the resort overbooked their available capacity for the punta cana and bavaro sections of the resort , which led to some inconveniences during our stay check - in : upon arrival , 12:30 pm sunday june 22, rooms had been oversold and check - in staff had trouble finding a room with two double beds ( we 're a family of 4, 2 adults , 2 children ) the only room available was with one king size bed check - in finally freed - up a room at 15:30 with 2 double beds a la carte restaurants : during the time waiting for our room to be ready we decided to book our three a la carte restaurants at customer service due to the large number of guests , only one restaurant was available customer service advised that we should check - in with them every morning at 8:00 am for cancellations well come tuesday , no cancellations , and my wife decided to take a more direct approach with customer service speaking fluent spanish , she explained that on the monday evening , we decided to check out some restaurants directly and discovered that the french restaurant cafe de paris ( on the bavaro side of the resort ) and the japanese mikado ( on the punta cana side ) were closed customer service now admitted that those two restaurants were just closed this week and that suddenly there was a cancellation at the dominican restaurant located in the club premier section of the resort we never succeded in getting a third a la carte restaurant and i believe the resort was limiting the amount of people in the restaurants as a measure of cost control sending everyone to the buffet is much more profitable for them the quality of food at the two a la carte 's was very good compared to the buffet buffet : turns out our 2 a la carte were booked for the last two evenings of our stay so the buffet was our feeding grounds for the first 5 dinners food was average , i 'd rate it a 6 on 10, with mexico 's grand occidental xcaret surpassing the gbp by far bars : popular tropical drinks ( pina colada 's coco loco 's ) are premixed from large commercial drink mixers and taste very artificial ask the bartenders for a drink that he has to prepare , like a strawberry daiquiri or margarita , and he 'll give you a dirty look suffice it to say that i stuck with lots of cerveza 's ( which is not their local presidente by the way but more of a watered down draft beer ) and cuba libre 's while my spanish speaking wife kept asking for the daiquiri 's and margarita 's oversold situatiion : here 's how the resort decided to handle the large number of guests booked during this week ( june 22-29) early monday morning , a flyer was distributed to every room in the resort asking guests if they would be interested in a free excursion to visit isla saona , altos de chavon , stay at the gran bahia principe la samana for one night , get a free upgrade to club diamond ( adults only ) or hacienda ( with children ) , and get a free security box on the condition that they pack and leave their room for one night the excursion would begin friday 6:30 am and guests were to return saturday 6:00 pm rooms had to be vacated and luggage would be stored in a special locked luggage room for the duration of the excursion the value of the excursion was approximately $100 per person and the objective was to get people off the site in order to accomodate other guests these flyers were everywhere , underneath glass table tops , at the bars , posted on large billboards outside the buffet restaurants , on check - in counter on friday afternoon , a group of approximately 300 guests , all employees of shell oil , arrived and took over the pool and beach area saturday 's regularly scheduled beach activities ( morning yoga session , dance lesson ) and afternoon pool aerobics , bingo game , and poolside dance lessons were cancelled because all the animators were entertaining the shell oil guests , partying on the beach on saturday , the beach and main pool was jammed with people water sports : could not get a booking for a free one hour ride on a catamaran the whole week because of two reasons one , only three of the six catamarans were operational , three were broken , and two , too many guests well , 10 minutes later , here comes my spanish speaking wife again and this time she asked for a one hour lesson at $30 and guess what , suddenly a catamaran was available for that lesson and it would be on the water in 5 minutes was this another example of limiting what is really free to guests so that they could sell a lesson lounge chairs at beach and pool : forget about trying to find a lounge chair at the beach or the main pool at 8:30 am on monday because of , you guessed it , too many guests here 's another unique trick guests were arriving at the pool and beach early morning and instead of reserving a lounge chair by placing one towel lengthwise per chair , they were actually placing their towels across two chairs , widthwise , thereby reserving twice the number of chairs at the beach and at the pool guess what we started doing early tuesday am status at other resorts : during the week , my wife and i walked up and down the beach to check out other resorts the majestic (5 * ) , just north of gbp , had 50% of the lounge chairs available at the beach and next to their pool the riu , just south of the gbp , had maybe 40% of lounge chairs free and the resort looked much larger than the gbp , in terms of surface area on the beach much fewer bathers were spotted at these reorts compared to the crammed pool and beach of the gbp overall , the grounds were impeccably clean , every morning the beach was cleaned of the thousands of cigarette butts and plastic drinking glasses left behind by late night beachgoers , the rooms were very clean , the pools clean are beautiful , and the staff did their best given the many guests on site if it were not for those few inconveniences and all those people , this trip would have been much more relaxing and would have ranked right up there i guess this was a situation where bigger is not necessarily better 
trip from hell our family has travelled to many destinations , and this was the worst ever first of all , since it is a spanish speaking country , we thought we would be ok since my wife can speak spanish , but the staff often acted like they did not understand her when it came time for them to give us change check in was a nightmare we arrived earlier than check in time and they gave us our keys but told us that we could not get the room until 3 we were fine with that , but the bellhop insisted on taking us to our room and told us that he knows the maid and can get us in early she was very annoyed that we showed up early and she was literally mopping around our feet in the room we felt very akward and decided to head back to the main building for lunch the buffet was absolutly unedible the food was gross the fruit was spoiled we knew we were in for trouble later we were told to meet for our orientation we showed up with another family and nobody else was there we found out later that they decided to move the orientation but nobody bothered to let us know anyway the next day my son got food poisoning and was throwing up for the next two days i got food poisoning the day before i left and have been sick ever since in the buffett we asked the head waiter if we could take some fruit to our sick son , and he was very rude and told us he would not give us a container and if we wanted something to call room service i ordered a fruit plate from room service and they were very quick less than 5 minutes but the fruit was all spoiled they must make up these plates and leave them laying around until people order them i cannot stress enough how disgusting the food is they do not follow proper food service procedures at the outdoor snack bars , food is sitting out for hours and covered in flies as for the bars they never make the same drink the same you can order a pina colada from the same bartender 5 times and each one will be a suprise one is worse than the next we met so many people that were also sick we are not picky people and like to try new things , but this place has the worst food ever dont go , unless you are trying to lose weight fast 
big and beautiful family trip with 22, 27, and 28 yr olds we enjoyed our time there the resort is certainly gorgeous we were in the bavaro side we found the staff in the buffet to be quite friendly and personable i have stayed in all inclusives before and was a little disappointed in the arrival normally you are greeted with drinks we were herded into a meeting room where we had to wait for someone to help us once we got to our rooms , we were quite impressed it took us a while to figure out how everything in the resort was set up , and found ourselves lost on the first night the beach is outstanding you can walk out into the water with no fear of stepping on rocks i expected to see topless women at the beach , but was surprised to see it at the pool we checked on reservations for ala carte restaurants , but were told everything except the barb - b - q was booked for the entire week we went to that and it was nice we checked the next day on reservatons again and were informed they had opened the prmiere restaurant in ambar unlike one of the other posters , we were not impressed with the this restaurant the service that evening was very poor if you have people who are picky eaters , it will be difficult my son was looking for some type of normal food i think he lived on watermelon and french fries we went parasailing and i suggest you pay with credit card we used the atm to get cash , as we were told we needed cash and it gave us pesos we checked with the girl at the desk to be certain we had the correct amount upon arrival at the parasailing , we were told we were short because they use a different exchange rate we said we would run and get a credit card and the one guy was very rude , saying it was too late i wanted to smack him i was just as stubborn and we got our way we also went on the caribbean festival and i would hightly reccommend it i agree with another poster that the pools need to stay open until at least 10, even if they want to stop the alcohol at 6 six o 'clock is way too early 
hope to go back soon we just recently stayed the bahia principe punta cana it was our first all inclusive vacation and first time booking online with a company we heard good things about called pricebeat our package was with sunwing vacations and went very well our week vacation went very well and we absolutely loved this resort the beach was amazing ? white sand and the water was so warm , clear and turquoise the food was very good , especially the lobster on friday nights overall we had an exceptional time and really enjoyed the nightly entertainment ( michael jackson and musical legend ) we??e definitely planning on going back to the bahia principe in the near future 
beautiful grounds - service spotty - wedding details included my husband and i were married in june 2008 at the gran bahia principe in punta cana we had a rather large number (44) of guests attending the wedding and staying at the resort we stayed for 9 nights and had guests that stayed as short as 3 days and as long as 7 days resort : the resort is rather large and parts of it are currently under construction the lobby driveway was being remodeled and if you tried to use the punta cana side of the lobby during the day , it was absolutely horrible also , i?? sure the staff was doing harm to their hearing , and their nerves , as they tried to cope with working in such an environment most of the construction is not at all noticeable except for the fact that their numerous clubs ( golden , diamond , ambar , etc ) are very confusing with everyone mingled in together due to the construction i?? still not 100% sure of what each of the clubs meant except that the ambar section was adults - only and a little quieter and nicer than the other sections the grounds are absolutely beautiful and perfectly maintained the pools and decks are cleaned at night and the pools were always in wonderful condition the main pool near the beach was always very crowded the quietest pools were in either the ambar , or diamond areas as there were always plenty of umbrellas and chairs at these pools the rooms were nice with a sitting area , bed and balcony the bathrooms had jet tubs and were marble and tile the bathrooms in the ambar section are a little nicer with a separate walk - in shower , toilet area and tub the spa was very nice we had the ??elaxing? couples massage and it was definitely relaxing we also used the water therapy area it was the neatest thing i??e seen it had two big pools ? one slightly warmer that the other with all kinds of different bubbles and massaging options there was also a small and very cold ??ool? there were also saunas and steam rooms with different temperatures it had several types of showers including a rain shower , bucket , and a therapeutic ( my favorite ) however , the prices are comparable to the u and aren?? a really great bargain ( $72 usd each for a couples massage the service at some of the restaurants was definitely lacking and spotty at times sometimes the service was wonderful and sometimes you were begging to get a drink while you sat at you table we ate at the bbq restaurant which is on the beach and has made to order steaks , pork chops etc , a salad bar and dessert bar the service here was quite good both times we ate there and you were able to enjoy the sounds of the ocean we also ate at the italian restaurant , which was quite good , and the service wasn?? at all bad here there was a salad and appetizer bar including a bruschetta bar , salad bar , tomato bisque , carpaccio , olives , and other ??talian? you then chose a main course the pizza was quite good at the italian restaurant the lobster pasta was relatively good some of the seafood options at the italian restaurant were mediocre the seafood restaurant?? appetizers were wonderful and included fried fish , calamari , steamed shrimp , shrimp cocktail , and a seafood soup the main dishes were not that good and we saw several other families just having the appetizers and salad for dinner we also tried out the garden grill , which was wonderful both times we ate there the skirt steak was delicious and the ??ouisiana corn chowder? the dessert bar throughout the restaurants was pretty much the same and relatively good the bananas drizzled in chocolate , fruit selection , ice cream , and mouse were all quite good the main buffet was quite good and although it did get a little repetitive , everything was still above average for an all - inclusive resort reservations were hard to come by ( you have to make them in person at guest services , though some of our family said they were able to call to make them ) and i recommend getting them as soon as you get to the resort if they insist that the only thing that?? available is bbq or nothing at all , just ask nicely again you can also come back later , sometimes there are cancellations and you can get squeezed in the drinks at the bars are very sweet and usually quite weak however , we often times asked the bartenders to add more alcohol and they always complied the best mixed drink we had while there was the capirinia it?? very similar to a mojito , but , with lots of fresh lime instead of the mint the margaritas were also quite good in general , the drinks at the lobby bars were much better , and stronger , than those by the pool area maybe the resort is trying to save us from ourselves by making the drinks by the pool and beach a little weaker i think that some of the inadequate service was just due to growing pains that the resort is feeling since it is expanding and growing so rapidly it also definitely has a big resort feel where you just feel like you are just another number wedding : well , the actual events leading up to the wedding were the biggest disappointment of our trip the actual wedding itself went off just fine however , everything leading up to it was so unnecessarily stressful leading up to the big event , we tried to stay in contact with the resort and understand what we needed to decide in advance , however , it was nearly impossible to get in contact with anyone via email or phone when we did get in contact with the resort , we were told we need to make a lot of decisions ( restaurants , cakes , flowers ) as far in advance as possible however , the follow - up information was never sent to us at one point we were told to provide our documentation ( birth certificates , single affidavit , etc ) in advance , however , it ended up that we were suppose to provide this when we actually arrived at the resort when we faxed in our deposit for the wedding (9 months in advance ) we reserved the restaurants , however , when we got there those weren?? available and we went with the bbq for the rehearsal dinner and the garden grill for the reception ( both restaurants turned out fine and the food was delicious we went through ??edo? wedding documentation to get all of our paperwork in order for the wedding they were so easy to work , very responsive and had a very quick turn around we got to the resort , had lunch and then went immediately to check with the wedding coordinator we were scheduled to meet with her the next evening at 5 ( two days before the wedding at the meeting we picked flowers , cake ( chocolate or vanilla ) , menus etc we were told the wedding would be at 11 am instead of 4 pm this is the hottest time of the day and there is no shade at the wedding gazebo we were quite insistent that we have the 4 pm time instead since that was what our deposit said that was the best time for us the coordinator did not admit that there was a scheduling mistake with the judge until we found the form we sent in and pressed the issue she then said there was a scheduling mistake she then said she?? try to schedule a different time with the judge if his schedule allowed up until 5:30 the day before the wedding , the time was still up in the air 
avoid this place if you are american , 5 stars my *** i went to this hotel for three nights for a friend 's wedding and was rather disappointed the beach was beautiful and the pools were rather nice , everything else not so nice check - in : jackhammers it was insane , i mean like a war zone and it went on all day and for hours on end it 's probably done by now ( pray it is if you made the mistake of coming here soon ) but how could you put people through that , this is supposed to be a vacation you have to come to the lobby for most of your meals , and being hungover and hearing deafening jackhammers ( i am not exaggerating , our group just started laughing at how insanely loud it the noise was facilities : lack of ac in lobby or most hang out areas really was unpleasant in that heat , especially at night when you want to relax and have some drinks the resort is also way too big , hard to keep a big group together , and who wants to have to ride a tram from one end of the resort to the other they also have way too many bracelet types and it is extremely confusing i had a golden club bracelet which got me 15 minutes internet access in some random hut ( not kidding ) and 24 hour room service ( which was so gross , ugh , feeling sick thinking about the food ) staff : this place does not really cater to english speaking people i understand when visiting a country to speak their language as much as possible but people in key positions such as receptions should speak english fluently i found the staff to be downright rude and nasty at some points other times they were very friendly , a mixed bag i guess rooms : awful beds , like a rock i know multiple people who had sore backs ac - does not work very well , took my room almost two days to get somewhat cool you have to leave a card in a slot when you walk - in ( hint any card will work ) to keep the power on and they also make you pay to use the safe in your room which is just silly beach/pools : really beautiful nice water , couple of bars easily accessible , plenty of shade we were there in june and finding a chair or spot in the shade was fairly easy only complaint is the activities people who blast what they are doing on giant loudspeakers so the whole beach can hear them and takes away from relaxing did not really hang out in the pool too much but had swim - up bars and was really nice wedding : i felt awful for my friend who had his wedding here there were so many screw - ups by the staff that were inexcusable , and they did not seem to care at all about screwing up i could go into more details , but in general i would strongly recommend that you do not have a wedding here food : disgusting , inedible , lunch food makes you long for cafeteria quality food i really do not know how anyone could like the food here no one on our trip liked the food when we left and found a wendy 's at the airport , we were all so excited ( i normally hate fast food , but wendy 's kicked [ - - - - ] compared to the 5 star bahia principe ) warning : my friend had his camera stolen from his checked bag , somewhere btw checking in at the united states and when he checked into his room , so keep anything valuable on you 
a very awsome resort we are hosting a group function in the dominican republic in punta cana in october of 2008, and we went to visit the bahia principe punta cana on june 26th lets start :1 upon arrival the lobby of the resort is awsome we were warmly greeted by one of the staff , and even though there english is slight you were able to understand them , and know they were glad you were there the property is so well maintained , groomed , and beautiful the swimming pools were all clear , clean , and just allowing the sun to shine bright on top the beach was even beautiful the rooms were nice , and clean when i arrived in the room the first thing i looked for was bugs , and i didnt see not one as long as i stayed ( hooray ) please tip housekeeping because its true if you tip them they continue to bring you new towles , lotion , etc now some foods were much better than other , but people have different taste buds my favorite foods were the seafood , japanennese , and the grilled burgers by the beach the drinks should be another time that you tip the bartender and the drinks were the bomb i was getting my drink on 4real again you just have to understand they speak total spanish there , and there english is slight , but everyone was we talk to was friendly , they were always trying to make to fill at home i just would like them to be able to slow down when there speaking so others can understand the safe in the rooms is expensive ( lower that price is outragious ) lol lol 6 i think they need to get new things to impress the guest , because i wasnt i didnt let that spoil my visit i enjoyed myself , and cant wait to my 50 friends come down to the resort so they can have a awsome time and this awsome resort 
if you 're looking to loose weight the beach was beautiful , the hotel was clean the only problem was the food the food was very much terrible , get ready to go on a forced diet for week the only thing that tasted relatively good were the cereals in the morning my mother even got sick from the food if you 're looking to loose weight , this is the resort to go to terrible food , and long amazing beaches on which you can walk to burn that extra fat by the end of the week , i was glad to come home to my fridge 
great but forget golden visited the gb from june 8 to 15 most people here have it right , the buffet is good but not 5 stars ( i never saw good seafood ) , the beach is beautiful ( but nowhere close to varadero cuba ) , the rooms are well - appointed and the grounds beautiful some staff is very nice , some do not bother , it 's uneven the drinks are so watered down my 2 year - old stole a taste of the coco loco and wanted more that 's how much you do not taste the rum too big for me , really , but my toddler loved the mini - train so we learned to live with it that said , one big warning i do not know what regular booking is like but the royal golden was a major disappointment we went to the iberostar last year and , in comparison , i did not see any superior service here , certainly not the kind you pay extra for sure , we were near the beach ( and away from the major construction site next door ) , but that 's it restaurant reservations were hard to get and you had to present yourself at the office , could not do it by phone the safe box is not included while all golden buildings are near the beach , the office handling you is at the club house ( as in the other end of the resort ) , where the premium bar sits there among the desk and computers ( honestly , we 're not drinkers so we did not care but it looked ridiculous and gimmicky basically , if you ask me , the royal golden is nothing but an excuse to make you pay for rooms near the beach , anything else attached to it is par for a 4-5 star hotel , not premium service i would say , get yourself a good travel agent that can book you close to the sea without going golden , on the side of the property away from construction and you 'll enjoy and save would we recommend but this is not a 5 star and the swimming is better in cuba have a good one anyways 
waste of money and time my boyfriend and i heard it was a great place from some friends who gushed how great and amazing it was we had high expectations and were looking forward to our trip the hotel resort is huge and absolutely beautiful , well - cared for and there 's security everywhere the food is okay , nothing awe - inspiring but we were not expecting much in the first place , since it is , after all , a third world country we managed to find food we liked to get us by but our friends who came with us did get bouts of cramping and diaarhea the staff were a bit snobby , no one was down - right rude but they were not very warm either alot of them looked quite bored being there at one point my boyfriend asked three different staff members where the bathroom was and they all gave three entirely different answers the beach and poolside is beautiful and clean except for one thing the minute you stepped into the ocean all you smelled was gasoline from all the boats passing by it was sun , water and gasoline all day long unlike cuba , the dominican had no fish in their water if the fish ca not stay in the gasoline - infested ocean neither were we we discovered on the 4th day of our trip that we were missing some money my boyfriend and i bring money solely for tips during our stay we took half of the money out with us and left the remainder in the lining of our suitcase we did not want to use the safe because it was $70 a day to rent and if the safe malfunctioned we 'd be screwed everyday my boyfriend would count the money in our suitcase on the fourth day we were $130 short the only person in our room was the maid since we had no proof we could not accuse her ( especially in a country that was not ours ) but she never looked us in the eye when we would greet her and the day after the money dissapeared a brand new maid came to clean our room what angers me the most is that we tipped her $10 the first day we got there this trip was not at all relaxing if anything i came back even more tense and agitated , and feel really stupid for treating people so nicely when , obviously , they did not feel the same way the only thing going for this resort is that it looks pretty 
but very large well , it was a very nice place , and the service was very good best check in/check out we 've ever had we made a few requests prior to arriving , and all were provided the kids club is excellent , our friends had twin 5yr olds with them and they utilized it all week food was ok with our package ( bavaro ) we had to eat at the buffet alot , so it became a bit bland after a few days we could only get 3 reservations , japaneese , french , and bbq grill , in my opinion they were all better than the buffet you wont go hungry , as there is alot of variety you can not go wrong with the beach , it is busy but fantastic use the water taxis , it is a great way to explore we also enjoyed the sunset tour , it was well worth the money only problem i had was the size too big for me my wife loved it , and the size was not an issue for her she wants to return , i dont but she will probably win that battle we had a great vacation 
hotel service and food are less than acceptable we just returned from the bahia principe in punta cana it was the worst vacation i have ever had the hotel itself is beautiful , the grounds are very well kept and clean , there are many things to do on the complex and the beach is amazing even with all these things going for it , the service and the food made this trip absolutly undesireable we had a party of 30 and were there for a wedding we were forced to eat buffect every night as reservations for more than 2 people were unavailable at any of the a la carte restaurants the buffet was the same bland food night after night breakfast often consited of the nights leftovers the challenge was trying to eat as a group there are 3 hotels on the complex , if y ou are staying in the punta cana section you can not eat at the bavaro buffet and so on we arrived at 10:30am , we got the room key at 4:45pm and when we finaly got to the room , it had not been cleaned from the previous occupant the ac was broken and took 2 days to fix , the fridge was broken and took 2 days to fix we had to call each day for face clothes and the ironing board when i approched the mnager to expalin that we were unsatisfied he said that there was a huge pile of complaints and there was nothing that he could do for us thank god the wedding turned out beautiful that was a perfect day however we were stuck with food poisening the next day i will never go back and do not reccomend this hotel the kids clud is also not very entertaining for kids up to 6 years old ( oitherwise they will be bored ) 
good time except why on earth the hotel continues to book rooms facing a major construction site is beyond me especially , when the resort is only half full we booked through signature vacations , and despite our prior request of not wanting to overlook a construction site , we ended up facing a construction site we managed to change rooms , but it was a major inconvenience our experience with the front desk staff , who were rude and condescending while requesting our room change , was almost enough to ruin the entire image of this hotel however , we got another room and all was exceptionally good for the rest of the week here is our summary : the very good : beach and ocean clean , white sand , and clear blue water pool and pool bar japanese a la carte lobby and piano bar , awesome drinks and atmosphere the good : our 2nd room , very clean , no bugs , great service , although we tipped the maid $2/day , which helped french a la carte activites , volleyball , watersports , aerobics , etc michael jackson and musical legends shows the staff , except front desk staff the fair : buffet , kinda repetitive and bland but pretty much what one expects from buffet food drinks , aside from piano bar watered down later in the day , typically stronger before noon and at the pool bar the nasty : the village with shops within the resort , and the mall via free shuttle , big freakin rip off the disgusting beach bbq restaurant , which has a guy cutting fresh fruit all day but no cook for cooking fresh hamburgers and hot dogs precooked beef sitting out in the heat attracting fies all day the bread , mostly tasted like it was baked a year and a half ago the nightime entertainment other than the shows listed above the ugly : the front desk staff and the italian a la cartein summary , we 'd go back but do beware , it is a big big resort so be prepared for lots of walking , although they do have a trolley if you wish to not walk also , calling cards bought in canada dont appear to work down there 
beautiful resort - just not for me my fiance  i traveled to the bahia on a one week vacation from may 3 to the 10th i want to start by saying that we were very apprehensive about the size of this resort it is indeed very large i will suggest if you are a person who likes a smaller resort and a more intimate feel this is not for you however - if you want a small feeling resort in the midst of a huge resort then book the premiere section a little hidden gem at the resort however , the beach is still a tram ride away and you will have to go through the resort to get there now this being said the trams run all the time and are very functional i was well aware of the lay out of the resort after 1 day it is not a hard resort to get around - it is just large i am a small resort person so not getting that personal touch of knowing all the people at the resort and them remembering you you definately are not going to have this feeling at this resort now on to the positive aspects of this resort well that is everything the resort is beautiful , the grounds are beautiful and the al la cartes that i went to ( medetarian , japanese  italian ) are all very good the buffet was good - by far the best is the saturday night gala buffet - i much prefer the beach restaurant for breakfast the eggs at the buffet were undercooked everytime i asked for an omelet my own fault - i should have insisted on it being cooked longer service - well everytime i asked for something it was brought right away now this being said we had to call front desk everyday to have our fridge filled up but in all honesty it did not matter i called and would speak to the most friendliest person on the resort by far and he had housekeeping at our door within 5 mins now - they do have some issues with organizational skills - keep this in mind our first night they called our room at 1 am to see if we were in it obviously they just did not know who was in what room this i think needs work but in all honesty if you saw the people coming and going everyday you would be like me and cut them a break beach - the beach is nice the water is warm and has all the beautiful colors you see in the magazines i will state that i much prefer the beaches of cuba just mostly personal preference and the lack of the huge crowds chairs - as this seems to be a huge thing with tourists we never had an issue finding them i will state if you are looking for shade you might want to hit the beach before 10 am but if you can tolerate sitting in the sun for an hour or so they do become available in the shade as the early risers are ready to retreat around 1 pm when the sun is the highest people - i found in all circumstances that the men were friendly i however did not meet one woman who smiled or acted in one bit happy to see you i know i hate putting on negative comments so do not blast me i wanted to give a very truthful review and this is it excursion - buggy tourif you are a person up for a muddy adventure this is for you 00 a person and you are gone for about 6 hrs you spend roundly 3 5 hrs in your buggy then you stop at a cave for a swim and do some very un orthodox horseback riding i say this as it is not your usual trail ride i was able to have my horse go full tilt and run back and forth to my fiance when he was trailing behind airport - uneventful coming in - and the best entrance to any country i ever had - zero security hagglesleaving - omg what a terrible experience i will leave it at that it is way too americanized for me saying this i mean it has lost its identity as a seperate country the people are very aggressive and do not mind asking you to tip them for selling you things too pushy for my liking and i do not like the whole bartering aspect and unmarked items just a personal preference therefore - if you are a person who wants to stay on the resort and not move - go it is great 
better tha fine hi , i 've been in bp may first week its pretty much as most of the comments you can read here , ( good food , nice place , etc ) so i just wanna talk about what i didnt find in the reviews have read before comments saying dominicans were rude , but i found you just have to smile they do not wanna like you just because you tip them , of course that could be a plus , but if you dont smile them since the beginning forget about it , it does not matter how much tip you them , they will be rude or ignore you , for me it looks kind of a pride issue , wich is fine and positive , doesnt matter you have more money than them , they just wanna see you smile , as they do the show at the pueblo principe was pretty fun and amusing , if you do not have a dance partner you can sit near the dance floor , there are entertainers who 'll invite you to dance , do not be shy they are very nice and quite good dancers after an hour the show is done , so every body heads to the disco , and that 's another story the disco pretty sucks ( did somebody say it before ) it smells , is small they just open for 2 and a half hours and try along to fulfill all ages dance music tastes , they start with some bee gees and 70's , go through 80's , ( miss the 90's , ) and finish with lots of regaeton , no salsa at all , a bit of merengue and a bit of bachata so here 's a tip for the women traveling alone : do not stay in this resort , i felt kind of trap here if you wanna go outside and try other discos it must to be taking a cab ( $15 each way ) , i did not feel safe to go by my own , so i went with a couple of guys i met , we did not became friends , so it was kind of uncomfortable all the way back the discos outside , i just try mangu , if you are in your 20ies it could be fun , i 'm not so it wasnt , that 's also why i recommend to go to the resorts wich are closer to the bavaro town , you 'll be able to try other discos outside more than once you can see in this map : http : //i31 til the punta cana princess to the south side , indeed into the punta cana princess is located areito , another disco i have heard positive comments but did not try this time so that 's only if you are traveling alone and are interested into the night life , if not , it does not really matter as you should read before , the beach is just amazing , no towel game at the time i was there , guess it depends of the season have been told at the main pool it was not the same , but in the others ones i found a place anytime for watter sports i highly recommend scuba caribe , they are not longer in bahia principe beach side , so you can find them at riu 's wich is just aside ( see the map again please ) i did scuba diving and even i got terrible sick once in open water ( tip : take dramamine half hour before ) they were so much kind ( thanks hamlet ) , i 'll defiantly repeat the scuba next time hope this can help you , have a nice trip 
lovely place but really big my fiance and i - age 31  26 just returned fromteh gran bahia principe - bavaro our stay was from april 24 - may 1st over all we had a fantastic time but this resort if huge we stayed in rm 24105 which is close to the beach and i was still having a hard time finding my room on the last day of our vacation it is not the kind of resort that you can run back to your room to grab something you need running back to your rooms means jumping on a tram and going for a 15 -20 minutes ride check in - fast and easy golden vs normal - we purchased the golden package what that truly means is 4 a la carte dinners vs 3, tons of beach towels vs towel card , a room close to the beach vs close to the main lobbies and buffet , access to 3 pool vs 2, housecoats and slippers if i were to do it again it would not purchase the golden package being closer to the beach means further away from the buffet food - good enough we always foudn something yummy beach - really nice busy - but you can always find a chair pool - well kept there is 3 pools so your should always be able to find a chair shopping - pueblo principe is the shopping area my advice - go into the stores and check out the pricing on items you ca not bargain with the stores then if you want to go bargain with the vendors go ahead the vendors start their pricing 3 x what the stores are asking so it might be cheaper just to purchase what you are looking for from the store if the vendor wo not lower their price rooms - really nice maid service was great needed an iron and that arrived in 5 mins had an alarm clock in our room it did not work and i asked for a replacement that never arrived no bugs or anything we did have a ground floor room entertainment - okay the shows were kinda boring so we did not attend many activites - their was not much to do on the resort so we went and did a bunch of excursions swimming with the dolphins - a lot of fun but you only get to swin with the dolphin for 10 minutes that is located in a zoo so after you can go see all the animals dunbugee - boring they just drive around the streets bavaro runner tour - great tour you go horseback riding , then to a ranch farm , then lunch , then cigar factory then sugar cane field then a different beach its a full day tour but you get to learn a lot about the domincan speed boats and snokeling - this was the best one you drive a speed boat about 15 mintues to a platform in the middle of the ocean to go snorkeling on a coral reef for an hour then you drive the the boat back half day but great experience i would go back to punta cana again but i look for a smaller resort this resort was really busy and big i prefer something a little smaller 
punta cana is beautiful my husband , kids (13 and 11 yrs ) and myself stayed at the gran bahia principe for a week at the end of april we chose to upgrade to the golden package , hoping to get an ocean view room we were in building 6 on the punta cana side there are very few ocean view rooms at this resort , the buildings are basically one behind another??e could not see or hear the ocean from our room the beach is very beautiful with soft , white sand the waves are fun and manageable my kids loved the boogie boards and parasailing we didn?? have any trouble finding shade on the beach regardless of the time of day we were disappointed that the beach bar closed at 5:00 pm each day the pool bar closes at 5:30 pm if you want a drink after 5:30 you have to go to the lobby bar which is a 10- minute walk not very convenient for all - inclusive the bartenders are fun but the drinks are a little light , not a problem if you tell them mucho tequila rooms are nice , not luxurious but comfortable the showers are interesting there is a glass wall from the top of the tub to the ceiling , but it only goes about a third of the way down the length of the tub after my daughter stepped out onto a very wet floor and slipped , we put a wash cloth at the end of the glass partition and also on the wall side to trap the water we found the beds to be ok , but there is definitely not a pillow top mattress as the web site promises our room was cleaned thoroughly each day , furniture is moved away from the walls and the floors were scrubbed please remember to be generous with the housekeeping staff , they work extremely hard to keep the rooms looking nice we loved the fresh flowers and towel art we were on the ground floor and didn?? see any unwanted visitors ( ants , roaches? food is good??ach day we ate at the buffet for breakfast and lunch the main buffet near the lobby offers many more breakfast and lunch choices than the other buffets that are more convenient to the beach we ate at the caf? french , the grill , the japanese , and the mediterranean our golden representative told us the buffet , the french and the japanese restaurants on the punta cana and the bavaro sides were the same all of our meals we tasty , but i do have to warn you??t the japanese restaurant , as the chef was preparing our meal in front of us , a roach scurried around the counter top he pretended not to notice , but the 10 of us around the table noticed i couldn?? help but think where there is one there are many each of the restaurants we went to were nearly empty , i?? not sure why it is difficult to get a 7:00 reservation as opposed to an 8:30 we had both , arrived early for the 8:30 and were seated right away with many tables available be prepared for a leisurely dinner at the ala cartes , it takes about 2 hours from start to finish we went to 3 shows , the lion king , michael jackson and sexes vs the lion king was good , younger kids would enjoy this show michael jackson show was fun to watch the men vs women show was pretty lame i was sorry to miss the international show , but do to our ala carte reservation time , we couldn?? make it we golfed at the punta cana golf course , which is next door it is very expensive and the course is not in very good shape we made our tee time through the golden club and were told it would be $145 per adult , $45 for kids when were arrived at the golf course , the kids were each $75 if i had it to do again , i would look into a different course one last note , this is a very poor area we took toys and school supplies for the children if you choose to do this , get in touch with mike at mike@mikesmarina info or [ - - ] mike came by the resort to pick up our donations very simple and very worthwhile we enjoyed our first visit to the dominican republic punta cana is a beautiful place , i would love to go back some day??ut not to the gran bahia principe next time we will try a different resort 
a good time just got back from an excellent week with friends at the gran bahia principe bavaro the purpose of the trip was a wedding and some fun in the sun and the gran bahia delivered on both counts we travelled with sunwing out of toronto and i was impressed with both sunwing flights ( if not the flight times ) the gran bahia itself is a large resort ( as mentioned in previous reviews ) but the transit system is very efficient and moving around from place to place was never a problem our villa was quite nice although it overlooked a construction site the beach area and pools were very good as well and kept clean which was nice the all inclusive drinks were pretty good and some familiar brands are included , you just have to ask ( tanqueray gin , smirnoff vodka etc the beer supplied in the villa mini bar was brahma and it was pretty good , the beer on tap ( presidente ) was not the best and perhaps some beer variety would be nice , especially for canadians beer connoisseurs the heineken i had at the airport was my favorite of the trip the food was simply ok but really ca not be classified as 5 star on any scale the french restaurant came the closest to a fine dining experience and even then there were inefficiencies very small shrimp in the shrimp cocktail and an ok but not great steak the house wine included , contrary to previous reviews , is actually not too bad and is certainly drinkable if you want , bring a bottle of your favourite wine with you and they will cork it and serve it to you i also visited the mexican and beach bbq a la carte 's and they were both fine the buffet was pretty good as well but the beach snack bar was a bit sketchy , ditto the overnight snack bar the wedding itself went off with out a hitch , and by all accounts the bride and groom were pleased with the service i also took in an optional snorkeling expedition which was well worth the money spent the service from the maids , wait staff and bartenders was superb throughout the trip the karaoke bar and the disco were both enjoyed by our group i enjoyed the karaoke bar in particular but was annoyed when several songs i chose out of their book were not available if you say you have a song , then you should have it instead i heard several repeat songs throughout the week that i strongly believe were dictated by the hosts personal taste ( billy jean for instance the casino was small but those in our group that visited seemed to enjoy it i was also impressed with the internet cafe and was happy to check in on the hockey scores etc one more little rant , with the number of canadians visiting the resort the gran bahia should have at least one canadian television channel available on the dial it was nearly impossible to get hockey scores without going online ( espn 's spanish feed gives every score in the world except nhl ) obviously , no one comes to the dr to watch tv but including cbc or ctv would allow canadian guests to get a quick update and then get out to the beach all in all , i had a wonderful week at the gran bahia bavaro with an awesome group of friends and would recommend it as a very good all - inclusive option in punta cana 
for the price i will start by saying i was born , raised and live in nyc and i travel at least once a year the reason i am saying this is because living here i know food that is good people kept telling me i would drive myself crazy reading other people 's reviews , and i should of listened , i went to this place with a knot in my stomach waiting for the aweful to start , and guess what this place is truly amazing , any picture i found of this place on the internet does not do it justice in comparison to seeing it in person the grounds are immaculate and big , very big there are 3 pools , the 1 by the beach seemed to be most crowded and have the most kids as it was by the beach , the one in the middle seemed the most quite and the one furthest from the beach seemed to house the drinkers and partiers one day during the trip their was about 8 drunken canadian messes screaming and pouring drinks in the pool , but they were at the other pool the next day so it was no big deal all in all the grounds are spectacular the room was great , the bathroom all marble and the balcony had a view of the quiet pool and the garden the maids do get annoying with the fresh flowers , every day when they clean the room you get flowers on your bed and in the bathroom , obviously it 's not that big of a deal also , none of the bathrooms throughout the resort had exhaust fans , strange obviously when taking a shower it got rather steamy the mini bar was great , beer , soda and water everyday , even if we did not drink it we 'd hide it so the fridge would get restocked , we wound up leaving 6 beers and a bunch of sodas , but they were there if we wanted them the food at the buffets was better than the sit down dinners although the sit down dinners offer a nice ambiance , the food is better at the buffets we chose french , the garden grill and japanese at the grill i had the mixed grill , it was good , no fireworks went off but it was good at the french i had some shrimp rice dish also good and the japanese place although had the best view it was the saltiest food i 've ever eating , but the experience was cool as it is a very nice place there were so many complaints i was concerned about that i read on reviews that i would like to address some of them the food stinks , it 's a buffet , the food is as good as it is going to get which i think was very good each morning they had an omelette , pancake and crepe station making them fresh , plus a variety of fresh fruits , breads , cakes , cereals etc etc for lunch you had so many choices of different buffets to eat at , italian , grill , fish , whatever you wanted was available the free wine stinks i thought the red was good , it was dry and nice tasting , i did not try the white though are nasty , in the 7 days there , i did not meet one rude person and i talk to everyone , even the groundskeepers offered a friendly hola no one speaks english - you are in a spanish speaking country , what do you expect actually surprisingly with my limited spanish and their limited english we got along quite well with that being said , i highly recommend this resort , i really do not have anything bad to say about it one more piece of advice these people work their butts off and to see people walking away from the table without leaving so much as a red cent is a shame regardless of tips being included a couple of bucks goes a long way i left $3 for breakfast , $5 for lunch and buffets and $10 for sit down dinners go out with some singles 
not a dissappointment/but not the best i 've had warning : airport is a rip off travelled the week of april 25th to may 2nd please be advised that if i seem picky on some issues , i 've travelled to a sandals resort , and nothing compares so far the good : italian , mexican , and japanese restaurants amazing refilled glasses before they were empty , allowed my husband and father to both try cooking on the big grills , showing them how to do it quiet/nice rooms , nice buildings the beach is amazing , all the pools are amazing lobby is very nice and a good place to sit and relax trolley service is amazing , as it is a big resort drinks were good service from the people who spoke english was amazing we travelled with our son who is 7 months old and got the best service and treatment for him everyone awknowledged he was around , and at every restaurant there was a high chair waiting for him the so - so : main buffet was good , however very repeatative service from those who spoke no english the maids and some of the restaurant servers spoke no english and it was hard to understand and sometimes frusterating for both parties the snack bar at the beach was okay , but again variety of food was just so so entertainment was so so , put it this way i was tired while watching one of the shows and we left , if it was a good show i would have stayed and watched it becareful tipping the maid too much , as they will expect it every day , and if you choose to not do it one day you may get no re fill for the mini bar the bad : the brazillian , and the dominican restaurants the food was good however , the service was not again the lack of english speaking servers was terrible they took our drinks while we were still drinking them awful service at these places other than that it was a great holiday we took many tours and they were all great we got asked questions mid week about out stay and if there was anything they could do to help , we asked for some things and they were granted right away we complained about a restuarant and given another a la carte i would have to say that the language barrier was most of the problem , and we made a suggestion that those not being able to speak english should be offered either a french or english spekaing course , this would be easier for both parties we also travelled with 22 people , 17 adults , 3 kids , and 2 infants occomodations were very good , and we were well looked after , my aunt with her 1 child was in a separte building from her other 2 children ( in their own room ) , when asked to move they accomodated us would i go again to dominican = no would i go again to a gran bahia principe = yes oh and 1 last thing , watch that at the airport check in they do not stand on the scale when weighing you 're luggage i caught the man standing on my scale i was not over going down with all the water and infant food i had to bring but i was 20 pounds over coming back with no baby food , or water i asked them to re check and made sure that the luggage bags were turned to that i could see his legs as well and behold i was not over any longer i will be speaking with air transat/nolitours regarding this matter they should have a canadian representative there at all times 
good value , but mediocre am a seasoned caribbean traveler , so please keep that in mind when reading my review was disappointed when our luggage was delivered to the bavaro lobby and was told we had to check in at the smaller one also was embarrassed when refused entry to certain restaurants and events because we were not bavaro guests , but principe guests we were not aware there was a distinction in fact , there are three classes of service rooms were great , they are all - suites , and for the most part , were kept exceptionally clean food was disappointing a big problem we found was that when eating at the buffets , the food was not hot enough for us by the time you sat down to eat , everything was lukewarm the themed restaurants were another disappointment , other than the gourmet restaurant - - it was excellent pool area was beautiful had to get chairs very early however although , there were three other pools that were not as crowded , so i guess it depends on the villa you were staying in beach was beautiful , but packed every day sand was gorgeous - and you never even needed beach shoes distinctive shipwreck off the coast plenty of beach activity staff could have been more courteous and attentive did not get the feel that they were happy to serve us , although there were a few exceptions shuttles were fun , although we were apprehensive at first it is a large property and the shuttles run often , so you are rarely waiting for a ride to the beach ( we were in a villa closer to the lobby and pool area ) roaches - several were spotted in the lobby one morning again , keep in mind that we are seasoned travelers the members of our group that had never been to the caribbean were very happy with almost everything - the temperature of the food being the exception there is definite value here , just go with an open mind 
not good this was our fourth trip to the dom rep , having previously stayed in riu and iberostar hotels which we consider to be much better this hotel is vast , some might say too big and is still expanding the apartments are set out in attractive gardens giving the impression of a town rather then a hotel our apartment was about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the reception/bar areas cars pulling tailers ferry people to and from the reception area from other parts of the complex beware , if it rains during the evening you will get very wet when going to eat or drink we found the food to be below the standard you would expect and the choice very limited it was often served up cold the snack bars around the beach area had a very limited menu and did not change thoughout our two week stay the main buffets were situated on the other side of the complex in the reception , if you were on the beach this involved a lot of hassle so people mainly eat in the snack bars during the day the room was ok but not as clean as we would expect , often when we returned in the late afternoon we found the towels had not been replaced we would then phone and wait anything up to an hour for clean ones during the evenings entertainment consided of a singer/pianist in the lobby bars , again the same music every night each night they had a show in the theatre which ran for an hour these were put on by the entertaiment team and consisted mainly of dance routines the big downside for us was the seating most of the chairs were set out like a cinema , very few tables , the drinks were served in small plastic throw away cups not conducive to a social evening out the beach is great , , flat white sand and very long the european habit of saving sun beds with towels has caught on and if you arrive on the beach later then 8am you may have problems finding one compared to other hotels we have been to in the dominican republic the overall consensus of our party of four was one of disapointment 
a roll of the dice like many others , i have a long story rife with problems , but i will keep this short the place is beautiful , big and clean but the problem is the service we got bumped to another hotel for our first night that was a huge hassle of course despite our protests , we had no say in the matter the a - la - carte restaurants are supposedly always all booked up i never saw any of those restaurants more than 50% full the resort management just wants to steer you to the buffet because it is cheaper for them for example , we showed up to le gourmet about 30 minutes prior to our reservation the place was mostly empty the maitre 'd pointed out that we we early and actually said our table may not be ready yet ( we were a party of 4) like i said , the place was empty she sat us down of course , but i hope you get the idea if you do not have the problems i had , and you may not , i think you will enjoy your vacation however , beware that it is a roll of the dice 
warning my freind got married at this hotel and whilst the wedding went well , i was bumped to another hotel three days prior to my arrival even though i was best man at the wedding to add insult , my wife and i had to pay a day fee of us$75 each to attend my friends wedding where i was best man the hotel grossly overbook their hotel and we were told by a member of staff that the priority is for clients who booked through first choice , anyone booking by expedia were effectively second class citizens and automatically tansfered elsewhere , and in most cases to three star accomodation we also met other couples who were bumped into other hotels and at our reckoning in the week we were there over 100 people had been transfered to other locations this included another wedding party the situation was so bad that there were posters at the venue asking people if they wanted to move into other hotels , with offers of up to $300 for people to do this i would seriously consider staying somewhere else and would strongly urge you to plan your wedding elsewhere 
absolutely breathtaking this is a very late review i just want to say it has been one of the best memories of my life the ocean was fabulous , clear and blue the hotel was very clean , rooms were large and nicely kept pools were well maintained and amazing i would recommend and have recommended this hotel to everyone i know food and drinks are abundant and there were many things to choose the sand was something i have never seen before , it was so soft like powder entertainment was pretty good my one and only complaint was that there was broken glass burried beneath the sand at the volleyball net two people were sent for stitches on different occasions this was not the fault of the hotel and they made sure to block of the area and four big wigs came to check it out after that it was routinely checked i would still go back tomorrow if i could , do not hesitate to stay here , you 'll never regret it 
loved the bahia principe bavero : ) i just want to start off by saying i have been to dominican 6 times to punta cana and 1 to puerto plata and i do not wanna go anywhere else but punta cana i went to bahia from april 13 to the 20 leaving from toronto with sky service the plane ride was a bit tight but managed for 4 hours arrive - we arrived in punta cana at 10:30am and its perfect clear blue sky day i was a little worried because before i left i was checking the weather on the internet and its said rain so do not believe what that says when we arrived at the bahia principe we where welcomed by a dominican lady with a cold drink and the theme bahia song check in was done on the bus so that was good we did not have to check in at the lobby rooms - the rooms where big and spacious its was a perfect room to spend a week in the bed was comfortable and always had the maid do i good job with bringing us what we needed did tip the maid $1 a day so that also comes a long way  food - breakfast was always good with eggs , toast , crepes , pancakes , doughnuts fresh fruit mmmmmmmmm its was great , - lunch i skipped i ate to much for breakfest but everyone else who came enjoyed it - for dinner we where only suppose to book 3 a la carte but managed to get 6 just go to guest services and ask that does not hurti enjoyed the italian , le gourmet , garden grill , mediterraneo and japanese loved those all i also went to the brazilian and did not care for that one because i am not much of a meat lover so i found there was to much meat but if you like meat go there entertainment - the entertainment staff was great every time i got to dominican i never have a problem with the staff there always so friendly and nice and always want you to have a great time they try to get you so involved with them grounds - the grounds are always kept so clean and nice and they really take care of it pool - the pool is so beautiful and big i just lied there all day and dipped myself in the water to get cooled off beach - the beach is beautiful clear blue water white sandy beaches what more can you ask for weather - blue clear sky and so hot and sunny durning the dayand night very humid and hot overall - my experience at bahia was a perfect vacation for all 6 of us i would highly recommend this resort to everyone who ever complains about this resort should not go on vacation dominican people work very hard to make your stay a good one and if you let the little things bother you stay home enjoy : ) 
about what we expected we had a group of 4 adults who traveled to the resort from april 11-18 we had preveiously booked at the eden h but changed to this resort at the last minute due to all the bad reviews about eden h we stayed at the palladium in riveria maya twice and knew generally what to expect from a large all - inclusive resort i also confess to being a compulsive trip advisor reader , and that helped me know what to expect about the size of the resort and the accomodations i would say that it was what we expected - the hotel is beautiful - i liked all the dominican art in the lobbies and resturants the grounds are absolutely perfect and there are workers working all hours pruning and watering our room was better than what we had at the palladium - all rooms are junior suites and very large and nicely appointed we were in building 8 top floor - no bugs and no noise our room was cleaned well every day my only complaint was that they did not always stock our fridge with beer - one day i even left a note in spanish requesting more , but no beer we knew about paying for the safe in advance , so that was not a shock we did have an ongoing issue with our room keys not working and had to have them re - programmed a few times i did not find that it was difficult to get around - the trams ran constantly , but mostly we walked the beach was amazing we got there between 7- 9 am and were always able to find 4 chairs in the shade we spent one day at the pool but preferred the beach becasue the breeze was so much more comfortable there we liked the beach very much as you could walk forever down it - in mexico you were hindered by rocks or other barriers we were able to walk down to the vendor area on the beach they are very pushy we also thought that the food was decent and sometimes quite good it was not as good as at the other all - inclusive but it is hard to know if that is this resort or just the dr in general however , we always found something that we liked to eat there are a lot of europeans at the resort and again - we were sure that they were not trying to appeal to just americans we ate breakfast many days at the sit - down resutrant by the beach because that was closest to our room the breakfast at the main buffet had a lot more , but we mostly ate light in the morning anyway we ate lunch at the beach resturant every day once you knew what to get , it was great the chicken is great and so i had chicken , rice and beans and fruit and salad every day there plus they have heinz catsup there in packets if you cannot stand whatever catsup they serve there french fries and pizza very good as well ( skip the tuna pizza ) we drank mostly beer but also had some margaritas and rum and coke the dr beer is very good do not be afraid of it we booked the a la carte resturants when we got there - italian , japanese and the garden grille those were the ones that seemed to get the best reviews actually , i thought that the grille would be the best but that was my least favorite i think that the beef there is just so much below the quality that we are used to in the us that no matter what they do to it - it will seem poor we had steaks , and they were not good and very overcooked we also ordered some kind of cheesecake and other cake at the grille and they were horrible had the griled tuna at the italian restaurant and again - very overcooked but better than steak i also loved the selection of appetizers at the italian resturant the japanese was our favorite - we liked the chicken the best ( the chef cooks you everything at the table - rice , veggies , chicken , beef , fish and shirmp - beef was very tough ) we thought that the red wine ( tinto ) was good but agree that the white wine was not what we are used to tasted very bad but after i drank three glasses one night - it started to taste better service at the a la cartes was good also , the atmosphere at all resturants was very nice we went on one trip - the outback safari - which was recomended by our apple tour guide it was well worth it we got to see the real dr and visited a house , coffee plantation , cigar maker , etc our tour guide franklin was fantastic - had to speak both english and french to our bus and did a great job we learned a lot they do not want you to bring things to hand out to the kids , but look at the outback safari website in advance about how you can help you can bring things and they will hand them out try the dominican champagne - sprite and rum that they mix on the bus we also had to go to the hospital because my husband got an ear infection that was an experience the resort only has some mild antibiotics , so if you need something more when you get sick - bring them with you or you will have to go to the hospital however , they did fix him up with an iv of something that we had never heard of here but it did help the doctors at the resort spoke english well , but the people at the hospital did not we did not go to any shows except for the michael jackson show - it was fun but corny we also had an occassional issue with all the smoking in the lobby - we were on the punta cana side - maybe it was worse becaue more euopeans there we did not try the bravaro side however , the lobby is open air so most of the time it is not noticeable we had a good trip and would recomend this resort to others 5 but there is not a box for that i think they try to make the trip as pleasant as possible , but they are not perfect i did witness people making a fuss over nothing there are apparently different cultural norms in the dr and europe recognize that and go with the flow 
fantastic wedding we got married on 5th april , and the day was fantastic lots of champagne , beautiful flowers and glorious weather in the main , we were very pleased with our holiday however , just a few gripes we were given the runaround with our wedding photos , service in the photo shop was atrocious they were dishonest , rude and very mocking no one took responsiblity for the mistakes , leading to us spending 5 hours in total over the last 48 hours returning to the shop to see if the photos had arrived despite booking the wedding party together on one booking , rooms were not together and two families did not have enough beds for their children for the entire two weeks , despite numerous attempts to resolve as others have said , english language is pretty lacking at the resort and you sometimes have to let things go as you could be wasting your time being understood reception very slow and tried to double charge my father - in - law pool bar staff excellent and entertaining caribbean festival trip was superb , sharks were amazing and we did not lose any fingers or toes beach was stunning and the sea was warm and turquoise blue 
arrived in la romana from saint john nb long drive to the resort , about 2 hours the roads were horrible and drivers were crazy they took you through a few little towns on the way sad to see how the people live check in was easy and quick we were repeat guest so we were upgraded to club diamond vip all that means is we got a free safe for the week rooms were fine we had a king size bed no bugs , no problems we ate at the mexican , restaurant not a fan not mch of a selection and the food was not very good next was the italian , not bad , but not as good as last year then the brazillian , it was really good if you are a carnivor meat and then some more meat , it was my favorite and the last was the garden grill , it was really good too , for carnivores beach and pools were great pool was always busy we only went there is rinse the salt water off ourselves beach was clean , lots of chairs but there were lots of ignorant people who would save chairs in the prime spots then not use them all day ( i wanted to throw their towles in the pool or ocean you would see the workers out all day fixing up the flower beds and tending to the lawns activities and entertainment we did not watch any shows or participate in any of the stuff they were doing we did not do any of the overpriced tours that the airline reps push on you this year ( we did the marinarium last year and that was really good we did a snorkel excursion with the scuba rental place on the beach ) it was 31 nothing fancy , nothing to eat or drink no safety instructions the boat operator stopped the boat over some reef , threw the anchor over and said go the water was rough , the current was strong , and the fish bit me when i gave them a roll that i stole from breakfast my boyfriend had to rescue a lady that was not a strong swimmer and help her back to the boat but i would do that trip again next year it was cheap , you did not have to drive for 2 hours to get to it , and did not have to spend hours on a boat drinking and dancing like some of the other tours all we wanted was to snorkel and that 's all we did it was great departure and check out were easy with no problems , had to pay for 2 phone calls it cost 5 00 for about 4 mins to call from the room using the hotel operator conclusion it was a great trip , hopefully we will be back again next year 
maybe 5 star , but service knocks it down a few stars overall , its a nice hotel not a 5 star , but the food was better than average for a carribean destination the service leaves a lot to be desired they do not know , want to know , or care about any issues you have when you approach anyone , they seem not to understand english do not get me wrong , i realize that i am in a foreign country and that they speak english better than i speak spanish so i 'm not knocking their intelligence all i am saying is that if you cater to mostly english speaking tourists , have someone at the front desk that speaks english also , i called head office in miami and they were of no help whatsoever bottom line , with this company , take what you get 'cause you are on your own some notes i wrote while i was there people come to clean the beach regularly main ( lobby ) restaurant smells of sewage at all meals staff at the hotel are worst i 've experienced on vacation ( except maybe mexico ) they have no desire to be helpful pretend to not understand until you say the words in spanish then , they repeat what you want in perfect english exception , the bartenders are pleasant strange , as i rarely saw them get tipped for example : waiter got our order screwed up at lunch one day ( which is bound to happen , we were in a group of 16) and he made it seem like we were the ones who made the mistake instead of just fixing our order and getting what we wanted , he remained there trying to convince us it was not his fault ( not that we made an issue of him getting it wrong , as i said , these things happen ) we finally had to firmly tell him to just get our new order also , on checking in , we ( all 16 of us ) were given wrist bands i noticed that 12 of us got one colour and 4 of us ( my family ) got a different colour when i inquired as to why , we were given a confusing explanation as to why ( to this day , i 'm still not entirely sure what the colours mean ) they led me to believe that certain colours ca not go to certain pools ( again , it would be nice to have someone at the front desk that spoke english ) well , when we explained that we all needed to be together , and what was the use of all of us coming to the same resort at the same time if we could not stay together , this seemed like an issue when it was clear that we would not back down , they finally gave us the same colour wristband but not before one of the staff at the desk insulted my wife by asking her well , what hotels have you worked at ( implying that unless you work in the biz , you do not know anything also , funny how he was able to communicate that insult , but no other information , coherently ) drinks are incredibly watered down very little alcohol content you want real booze , buy it at duty free and bring it with you to the hotel head office is no help basically this whole company is geared to taking as much money from you as possible one of the small but incredibly brilliant ideas is the use of towel cards at the end of the day , you hand in your dirty towels and instead of getting clean towels ( like i had to do at other resorts ) and carrying them back to my room , they give out towel cards ( like credit cards ) saves you from lugging towels around the resort if your flight leaves after 12pm ( noon ) you can shower in the courtesy room before you leave this is essentially a communal washroom with a shower you could ask them for an extension to you checkout and they let you stay in your room ( if available ) this cost us $20 per hour may seem petty , but they blare the music at the beachside restaurant and it sounds like the station is not tuned properly try hearing that for and hour every day while you 're trying to eat maintenance leaves a lot to be desired there is always something not working properly a light in the restaurant here , a juice machine at this bar or that one , a clogged drain there and the staff make no effort to get it fixed right away , but it does get fixed , so maybe they are busy/short staffed it is a big resort safe is available , but for $35 a week ca not remember when a 5 star hotel charged for use of a safe the rooms were large and always clean in our group , there was an 18 and an 17 year old and the cleaning staff even did a little organizing for them the shower had a removable shower head ( a godsend when you have small kids ) with good pressure and lots of hot water all in all a nice holiday , but far from the perfect 5 star experience 
trying to keep up with the crowd the resort is huge and there are obvious signs of problems caused by the size of the property and the number of people when we were checking in (2 adults and 2 kids ) the clerk at the reception told us that there are about 5000 people staying at the resort at the time obviously the management is failing to keep up with such crowd and there is definite lack of facilities this was the first resort wheni see people turned down from making reservation at the spa because there were no availability our room which was requested in advance to be quite was instead right at the rear end of the theater and there were no way to change it to something quieter because resort was constantly overbooked if you really into spending vacation at the very busy place then this place might be up to your taste my wife said about the lobby that it looks more like a chicago union station some years ago with howling noise , smoke everywhere , swarms of people with piles of luggage but please be warned that this resort is not going to give you promised an expected to 5 or even 4 star service for example try to enjoy your desert with the coffee or tea at the dinner and you will see that its quite impossible to accomplish apperantly , coffee and tee are only served for breakfast and desert is only served for dinner and of course you cant take any food from the buffet to the lobby and you cant take any drink from the lobby to the buffet and yeah , try to get some food from the beach snack shop 2 minutes before official opening time evenif the shop is open and some food is already there its not allowed by the rules of resort - this phrase was something new to me to hear at the all - inclusive in dominican other than that , enjoy your vacation , dont mix a lot of mamajuana and sun and use spf50 sun lotion last thing , try to avoid first floor - tiny ants are little buggers 
had a great trip we stayed from friday march 27th through april 4th , 2008 our group of eight from michigan , usa had no idea what to expect from this resort we read reviews , of course , but opinions are just opinions we started off on the wrong foot with the front desk sending us to the bavarro side , and then the bavarro side sending us back , but all was worked out in the end my wife and i had a main floor suite in building 29 we liked the location as we were a little closer to the beach etc but still near the middle of the resort we would recommend a room on one of the upper floors as tile floors make for added noise from above and the humidity did seem to be an issue more for us than other members of our party the resort is large , but the walk to the main lobby or the beach is a few minutes at best either way much like a cruise ship , it takes a day or two to find your way around the tram that runs every few minutes was used a few times , more for the novelty we read reviews about obnoxious odors from the tram , but found that to be false odors from a gas combustion engine there are seperate walkways for pedestrian traffic and the trams on the main concourse we never felt threatened by the tram there are lots of people , but spread out over a pretty large area knowing a bit of spanish would not hurt , as most of the staff do not speak english ( or any other language from what we could tell ) the beach and pools are a bit crowded , but we never found it impossible to find a place to sit we were told the resort was full but still room was not an issue if you are looking for a quiet getwaway with you , your significant other and two palm trees , this is not it we enjoyed meeting some people , people watching and a great , beautiful beach my wife and others wished for more restrooms closer to beach and the pools the staff was great most gave it their all even when we could not understand them , or them us a few of the bartenders are characters and we enjoyed them throughout the week our maid granted every request we were told to get a safe , and did , and kept our valuables locked up one of our party left a bag at the beach which was turned into the bar by the pool it contained cash , a video camera , a digital camera and assorted other items we asked at the lost and found several times , but located the bag the next day at the bar , under the counter , with the bartender shouting yes bolsa ( bag ) and returning it without an item missing this is not what we heard we could expect of the staff we were very pleased about the honesty of staff there is internet service for a fee we emailed home daily to check in on our family $12 for 60 minutes that could be used anytime over 5 days we found that my cell phone was useless but others in our party had service changing in currency was not a problem , just find the front desk during the day , and you are ok bring an insulated mug , as the plastic cups get warm fast in the heat they will fill any size at any bar , with anything you 'd like the electricity in the room is activated by sliding a card ( its supposed to be your room card ) in a slot as you enter the room the ac does not work if the card is not in the slot we brought a old gift card with a magnetic strip to get around that issue bugs were not an issue , although we did see a few mosquitos we brought plenty of singles for tipping , but saw people who were not tipping and being treated the same , tip or no tip dining was interesting i would not call the buffet five star i think the cruise ships have this beat , easily but , there was variety and no one went hungry the service at the buffet was fast and courteous the ala carte restaurants varied greatly we were told that the french restaurant was the one we spent nearly 3 hours trying to get our party fed at le gourmet the service that night was horrid and the food voted mediocre by most of the party we also ate at the japanese and italian restaurants and found the food and service much better and worth the visit all in all , it was a great time we sang at the karoke bar , we watched a few shows , got a tan and had an experience that we have never had before i think that some of the negative reviews were a bit scary , but unfounded there is no place that is perfect if high class dining is first on your list , you might make another choice if a great beach , friendly people , great weather , and clean beautiful grounds are a priority , then you will have a great time here 
generally great - some issues stayed with wife ( we are in 50's ) and 2 daughters (20 and 16) at end of march 2008 in principe side ( bavaro side is a mirror image ) we have travelled caribbean and mexico every year for last 25 yrs or so , generally at all - inclusives this is not 5 star in us sense , but pretty close for a caribbean it was pretty crowded , tho only an issue at peak beach time ( in which case pools were less so ) and at prime mealtime - do not get in way of a hungry tourist airport busy - attached by luggage guys ( there are more than tourists - they try to rip the luggage out of your hand ) but for a few bucks they get you to the right transport , so probably worth it stand in line to pay $10/pp tourist card ( in lieu of visa ) charge - only cash plusses are : beautiful property ( very well manicured ) rooms large and clean ( tho the usual caribbean handiwork in tile , etc ) room frig stocked daily ( more stuff added if ask and tip ) easy navigation on property ( tho large , timely transport plentiful ) huge buffet ( decent for crib , tho can get boring after a week - and any meat besides chicken is tough ) good bar service generally pleasant staff ( as long as no complications of even the smallest kind - that throws them - and customer service in a us sense is inconceivable to tem no animosity , they just do not get it ) negatives : reservation system for non - buffet is awful ( no phone calls , place is emplty , wo not let you in anyway without reservation ) reservation for water sports ( same poor practice - in person only , then stuff sits there while you watch when those reserving do not show ) tennis courts poor shape and very far from rooms nightly entertainment packed early so no room to go ( some may be too risque for kids - typical european taste in dance i have seen strippers with more clothes ) people mark chairs at pool by 7 am , so none left by 9 am ( against the rules , but no enforcement ) tho the beach was a little better supplied with chairs no elevators in 3 story buildings vendors at mall in front of hotel severely harass shoppers local and european men guests harassed my young daughters ( they are beautiful , and somewhat used to stares in the us also , but would not go to beach or shop without me to help them fend off catcalls and followers i did feel that all staff had the hand out for tips ( i am not complaining , as they are poor , but its a fact ) other things noted on this site and true - there is a little topless on beach , but not much the non - serving staff ( cleaning ladies , maintenance , grounds ) do not speak english tho servers at desk , bar and dining do fine bar tenders will pay more attention if you tip a dollar every couple of drinks ( take a roll of 50 $1 maids stock better with a few dollars tip a day take an extra credit card as the room a/c and all electrical power only works if you put your room key ( or the credit type card you substitute in its place ) in a slot by the room door negotiate for trinket purchases ( at least a third off asking price ) at mall and beach vendors ( not at the lobby stores - can get the same stuff at half price outside ) bring lots of sunscreen ( its very burning , tho not hot due to breeze ) other things seen on this site that were not true for our visit : not much cigarette smoking food plentiful and decent no crime ( felt very safe - tho did lock valuables up in the $32/week safe ) lower number villas are farther from beach , not closer no difference in regular room and diamond the fun staff do try to get activity going ( bingo , aerobics , ping pong tournament , etc ) despite the fact that many tourists ( like me ) have no interest - if you want to do something , you can no bugs or mosquitos flight home ( united ) - mobbed by luggage guys again , but they helped get us to correct airline ( very poor airport layout - could stand in wrong line for hours security slow and caribbean inefficient ( they forgot to charge the $20 departure tax tho - yeah allow 2 hours at peak time i will not go back , as there are other places in the world ( i have only gone to one place 2x - aruba despite some wrinkles with checkin and a couple of small , stupid and frustrating service problems , its worth the trip for the price 
not so bad travelled to bahia principe march 18 and returned april 1 travelled with my wife and two kids , 13 and 11 roomsour first week we stayed in villa 17 near the two lobbies in a ground floor room the rooms are nice , we had two double beds and a sleeper sofa beds were comfortable yet small and we had no issues with room we were upgraded to golden the second week , villa 22 ( near the beach ) and while the room was very close to beach , all the other extras are a bit of a scam complexbig is the first impression the trolley is good but it only takes about 5 minutes to walk from either lobby to the beach no matter what villa or what upgrade you have , you will be going from one end of the resort to the other the buffets , restaurants , lobbies , shops , pools are all spread out so get use to it grounds are immaculate , people always working the construction for those who backed onto the site looks like it would have been annoying especially considering the service road there is really busy poolsthree pools available to those unless you are ambar or premier the main pool is nice but very busy and the chairs go fast there are two pools in the middle of the resort , one for regular guests and another for diamond/club hacienda these two pools are smaller and fill quickly problem i noticed especially at the two smaller pools was that ambar and premier guests were taking up the limited number of seats this causes a few problems as regular guests are not allowed at the ambar or premier pool foodbuffets - there are two buffets , one in each lobby there is alot of selection yes we did get cold food , food that was over - cooked and the taste was different but food was not problematic i did notice ambar guests were being turned away from these buffets a la carteswe ate at (7) of them :1) french - service and food excellent order the filet mignon , it was incredible 2) mexican - service and food excellent buffet style appy 's that were usually enough we ate twice here garden grill - steakhouse , good service and the food was very good japanese - excellent food , service ok the cook we had was a rookie so we did not get a show like other guests italian - food was ok but service was horrible appy 's not good if you have kids6) mediteranean - food horrible ( cold ) and service was absolutely brutal7) brazilian bbq - service was ok , alittle pushy but the food was brutal they totally over - cooked all the meat to the point it was burnt if you like well , well done , this ones for you snack bar at the main pool , it was ok for salad , burgers , hotdogs , pasta and we ate lunch there most days only because the buffets are at the other end of the resort serviceslow is the first thing that comes to mind we asked for a cot the 2nd or 3rd day and were first told the hotel did not have any we went to guest services and they called the housekeeping manager directly but one never showed up be careful what you leave out in your room we took down some snacks for the kids and some of those were chocolate bars the bars were inside a drawer and went missing we thought no big deal and did not mention it but then we were tired one night and came back early from the show at about 1030 pm , we heard someone entering our room my wife confronted an employee entering our room when she saw my wife , she pretended to talk on a cell phone and left later that night , at 0300 am , we hear a knock on the door answer the door and another employee is standing there and claims she is looking for her 17 year old daughter not sure why she checked our room but something fishy here we complained in the morning and were quickly escorted to guest services we told them what happened and they were not happy there was no reason for the first employee to be entering our room we were not golden at the time and were not getting turn down or towels replaced we ended up getting t - shirts , flowers , fruit tray and a letter of apology from the manager so beware , they can enter your room at anytime and chocolate is like gold there shoppingpueblo principe at the front of the resort is ok the cheapy cheapy huts are about 20-30 minute walk down the beach to the right everything is expensive so take lots we ran out of sunscreen , very hot there , and it was $15-20 us for a bottle that would normally cost $8 make sure you bargain , there first price is usually so bad it is insulting divide it by half then do it again and that it the price you should pay our last night , we bought a wooden gecko and a bamboo wind chime for gifts the guys first price was $140 us i could buy it at wal - mart for $30 probably at the end , i took out $35 us and said that 's it , and after much groaning and whining i walked away with the stuff beachbest part of the resort lots of chairs and palapas beautiful sand and water though it is rough ( wavy ) the beach was closed for one day , they actually had security to keep people out of the water as the waves were large and the current was strong you will not be disappointed by the beach activitiesanimation crew tries really hard and are entertaining we watched the lion king and most of michael jackson , very good shows there is mini - gold , tennis , basketball , tennis and lots of games at the beach and pool if you want to do something , there is lots to do if you have kids , try the mini - golf , its a bit of a joke but the kids loved it upgradeswe were upgraded to golden club for the second week of our stay the golden club is closer to beach but the extras imo are not worth the extra cash room service is a joke all you get is left - overs from the buffet i ordered chicken nuggets and fries and they were absolutely cold and had been sitting around for hours 
a very good resort for the most part ( complete review ) our family of three ( ages 41, 38 and 10) stayed here ( club diamond area ) from march 8th to march 22nd , 2008 we read all the reviews for three months before going this review is a bit long ( i noted things each day ) but should answer most of your questions our first week ( march 8-15) it was punta cana - da , since it was the ontario march break week two ( march 15 to 22) it was a nice mix of americans , canadians , brits and other europeans with a few folks from venezuela and mexico , from what i could tell of the languages being spoken the property - - yes it is big , but the shuttles run every 2 to 3 minutes the property from the highway entrance to the beach is about 1 6 km (1 mile ) long the actual length of the resort from the pueblo principe ( the shopping area ) to the beach is about 800m ( half a mile ) yes it is immaculately kept they are always cleaning or painting or repairing stuff or watering the grounds are immaculate no it is not confusing take 10 minutes to look at the map , orient yourself and you will be fine those who think it is complicated probably live in a town with one street this resort is actually four resorts in one : - - premier is a quaint section closest to the shopping area , spa and gym ( it 's dinky for a 1,900 room resort ) and main reception lobbies , yes lobbies but farthest from the beach - - ambar is down on the left ( when looking toward the beach ) and is adults only ( they have two separate a la carte restaurants , separate check - in and their own gym ) - - bavaro is on the left hand side and includes club diamond and some gold club and the private hacienda/club diamond pool - - punta cana is on the right hand side with the all access pools the food  restaurants : - - the buffets ( on both sides , punta cana and bavaro ) in the main lobbies are standard breakfast is the best meal ( get your omelettes extra cooked , trust me ) , lunch is not bad and dinners are usually themed mexican , caribbean , international , seafood but there is always a pasta bar , kids section and flatbread pizzas there is a good selection but it is a buffet , food is hardly ever steaming hot at a buffet here 's a hint , go to the middle of the serving dishing ( lasagna , fries , prepared meats are warmest in the middle ) for one week it is not repetitive , for two weeks , it 's a touch repetitive note : the buffet from 8pm on is a zoo go earlier if you want better selection and something that does not resemble your high school days - - the pool snack bar and beach snack bars are okay for midday snacks ( burgers , dogs , a pasta , nice fruits , bread section , a chicken and/or fish selection , etc buffet is good for lunch club diamond and gold club members can also do lunch at the italian , which is nice we did steak house ( twice ) , mexican , mediterranean , french and japanese for our a la cartes over the two weeks steak house and japanese were quite good , the others so so depending on the night they may rush you or service may be slow it is all a function of volume if you are hacienda , diamond or gold club , you can email public relations at the hotel in advance to get your reservations pre - booked , if not , you have to blow two hours your first full day making reservations but there are 10 restaurants to chose from ( not including the two in ambar if you are staying in this section ) - - breakfast near the pool in the mornings ( restaurant or snack bars ) is okay , but not as nice as the buffet the bars are fine , but for a five star resort , you would think that premium brands ( crown royal , johnny walker etc ) would be included as opposed to extra charges animation team  shows : - - animation folks are outgoing but not aggressive in terms of beach and pool games the michael jackson show on monday nights is good , the others , so so but they try hard the theatre each night is pretty packed get there at least 30 mins before for a good seat go to the theatre bar for drinks , the service is somewhat slow lobby bar on the bavaro side has a singer/piano guy most nights who is gawd awful i wish i would have tipped him not to sing and play beach  pools : - - beach is nice buy crowded similar to stretches of the mayan in mexico or veradero in cuba hotel after hotel , people galore but it is nice white sand and a good 40 m (44 yards ) at low tide the water is warm and swimming areas never go over your head - - pools are clean ( except for beach area pool ) but can get busy like a cruise ship on a sea day at times if you put your towels down between 7 and 8am at the pools you are okay , 6:30 ish or so for prime spots under a palapas at the beach iservice : - - this is basically good in terms of serving staff , but the resort is so huge , you never get seated in the same buffet section twice , the bar staff is respectful or warm but usually not superfriendly tipping does not seem to influence service maids are quite and quick cleaners technicians ( just call front desk ) for any problems , were johnny on the spot in 5 minutes same thing for bellboys on checkout pet peeves : - - capuccino 's specifically order them hot or the cold whipped cream makes them taste like a frapuccino from starbuck 's or iced cap from tim horton 's folks who are noisy in the early am or late at night people , it 's a resort , shut up and keep your voices down when coming back up the stairs to your room apparently it 's a cultural norm for little munchkins to run all over a buffet or a la carte restaurant during dinner if you want to avoid kids at the restaurants specifically , book a time after 8pm if your boy is 10 or over , when you go to an a la carte restaurant , make him wear some pants as opposed to shorts and especially for the north americans , take off your baseball caps when eating at an indoor restaurant kids and adults alike summary : - - this is a very nice resort , but the dominican ( like cuba ) is still a third world country if you want pure five star , 100% attentive and flawless service , then please stay in your cushy europoean city , u s suburb or canadian locale minor stuff will happen hear , roll with it and remember a vacation should be like the old motto when it comes to golf your worst day on the greens is still better than your best day at the office if you have other questions re : rooms , excursions , tipping , exchange rates , bugs ( there were not any ) , just drop me a line , i will try to answer them 
average service our family of five just returned from a spring break vacation at the bahia principe our party included two teenage boys and a 10- year - old we were a little worried about the vacation after reading some of the reviews from travelers in february fortunately , some of the problems they encountered such as mosquitoes and other insects were not present in march overall , we had a good experience when we travel to the caribbean we know to expect a more casual and beachy feel at the hotel also , even though we are not laid back people we try to enjoy our vacation and deal with whatever sitaution may present itself below i will discuss the hotel in more detail : grounds and beach : the grounds are well kept and beautiful flowers , plants , hummingbirds and well - kept pools the sand is white and soft the ocean warm and blue just what you should expect in a tropical setting it is a very large resort and is easy to get around by walking or shuttle even though it was a very busy time of year , we never had trouble getting lounge chairs at the beach or pool food : we were able to go to six specialty restaurants during our ten day stay the italian and french were our favorite the fish restaurant was terrible , mostly because of substandard service the buffets are quite good for an all - inclusive we have some picky eaters in our family including : a vegeterian , non - cheese eater , nut and fish allergy we were always able to find a variety of items there was always a huge selection of delicious fresh tropical fruits check the cdc website before traveling we were advised to take malaria pills as there was a confirmed case of malaria in february these must be started a week before travel rooms : we decided to upgrade to the golden club most of our time is spent at the beach and these accomodations are very close to both the beach and pool the rooms were fine , kept clean , and the mini bar well stocked service : we did have a problem at check - in our travel company had given us vouchers with the wrong information our teenage boys were categorized as children rather than adults we had paid the adult price , but the form was wrong the clerk was not helpful with the problem although it was not the resorts mistake ( or ours ) , we were having problems getting through to the united states to have the issue resolved no one seemed to care or to want to help us with the situation it took 2 1/2 hours and a more helpful clerk to finally get it resolved they would not let us check in to even one of our rooms ( which was fully paid ) it was very upsetting and should not have taken so long often , during our stay we had trouble getting service i assume this is the case because there are a lot of guests and not always enough staff dive center : teenage son received his scuba certification and traveled to catalina island great service and fun overall , we enjoyed our vacation there were people of all ages and from many different countries even though there were some problems , various issues can occur anywhere we would definitely go back to this resort 
punta cana 5* but not this complex after all the years using this site i thought it?? about time i contributed 1 adult and 2 children in a party of 18 for a wedding we only went for 2nd week ( rest of party were there for 2 weeks ) check in : - completed on transfer to hotel , key cards worked and room in same block as party that had travelled out the previous week the room : - clean and nicely furnished i had requested 2 beds but got 1 double plus sofa bed by time i would have had to wait to get sorted i didn?? take any further grounds : - very clean and tidy beware of tram ( car pulling trailers with seats ) , these run all day up central path and do not observe pedestrians , especially if you have young children staff : - all staff that we came in to contact with were extremely happy , especially waiters in main restaurant and bar staff in pool bar ( non diamond pool ) manager in guest services was very unhelpful , other members of party had pre booked a few of the additional restaurants and were told that it would be no problem adding my party of 3 to these bookings once we had checked in , when we tried to do this we were advised restaurants were full food : - basic in main restaurant and a bit repetitive ( even though we were there for 1 week ) italian  garden grill nice but japanese ( mikado ) was out of this world pools : -4 pools in total , depending on level of guest ( gold , diamond , ordinary )1 pool for gold , 1 for gold and diamond , 2 for all main pool by beach for all guests was very busy sun beds around smaller pool for all guests got reserved by about 09:00am so be prepared to join in sun beds around diamond pool were available all day the beach : - having stayed in punta cana before ( rui bambu ) the beach was one of the main reasons for coming back to this region the area in front of the gran bahia principe has been ruined by the sheer volume of straw beach umbrellas that are now in place years ago it was just palm trees , but now 200 plus people all occupy a small space with the usual reservation of sun beds starting from either the previous evening or from 07:00am entertainment : - all shows very good apart from man v women night use waitresses for drinks as quicker than waiting at bars to summarise : - having been to punta cana before i would defiantly come back but not to this hotel it would have to be to one of the smaller rui hotels just along from this hotel , i felt like i was on holiday here and truly a guest of the country this complex is too big and as such feels very in personal it is made up of 4 hotels , the main 2 being gran bahia principe punta cana  gran bahia principe bavaro ( punta cana for european?? and bavaro for americans  canadians ) then the club diamond guest?? and the adults only part there is too many different types of guest?? for the complex to function as a true 5* resort surely if 5* then this should be for all the food in the main buffet restaurant caters for the volume of users , rather than focusing on quality defiantly recommend the italian  japanese ( mikado ) 
just returned from the gran bahia principe over march break we took our three kids down (15, 17, 21) for our last big family trip and it was beyond what we expected service was outstanding the staff tried very hard to please but the spanish/english language barrier was often a problem the resort is one of the most beautifully landscaped we have ever seen and my wife and i have been to many including 5 sandals food was good but got just a bit predictable by the end of the week originally we were told we could book only 3 ala carte restaurants but we returned and booked 2 more they were never full anyways the resort is huge but there are constant shuttles to ease your tired feet our room was beautiful and spacious and the maid service was very good we did however , have to go find towels once as she forgot to leave us some the in - room fridge was dead when we arrived but we called and had a repairman within the hour to fix it the pools are beautiful and clean with lots of chaise lounges to lie in we did go down in the morning to stake some out and this is when our only problem occurred we had left a beach bag , on one lounge with our towels books etc then went to breakfast when we returned , it was gone we lost a watch , inexpensive camera , an ipod and all of our suntan stuff we did not think before we left as everyone did the same but somehow we got nailed a security guard went with me while we scoured the beach , garbage cans , foliage etc but no dice oh well , lesson learned so be cautious about what you leave unguarded this was the first time we have ever encountered this situation i went scuba diving and it was great the whole family went snorkelling and enjoyed it very much we were a little concerned our three kids would be a bit bored but it was not the case they had a ball and now love the caribbean the shopping is not good and very expensive on site do not expect to buy any suntan lotions as they are a ripoff we , unfortunately , had to replace ours that was stolen so take lots with you all in all a very nice and much - enjoyed vacation i would recommend it for families , couples and friends travelling together not too sure about really young kids though 
but would not go back in february going to split this review into 2 parts , first , general comments about the whole holiday , then specific comments about bars , restaurants , beach , pools etc flew out to punta cana february 20th for two weeks on arrival at the airport we were pleasantly surprised by the speed we got thru ' immigration altho ' we had quite a long wait for our suitcases first moan , the usual problem with porters - we found a trolley but were prevented from taking it out of the airport to the carpark by a group of porters with their own trollies i refused to be blackmailed on principle and was proved right when we only had about 50m to walk to the coach once on the coach we had a relatively painless journey to the gbp bavaro ( actually punta cana section ) with check in being carried out on the bus ( there was however a confusion over another party with the same surname which came back to haunt us later ) no issues on arrival , porter was ready and waiting to transport us and our suitcases straight to our room - 12301 - located conveniently near to the pool , with a balcony looking out over the widerness area between gbp  the neighbouring rui complex the following morning we had a pleasant walk back to the reception area for breakfast and our reps meeting ( the rep for first choice was really on the ball and the meeting was much snappier and entertaining than normal ) i then organised a room safe - bit surprised that i had to pay up front ( gbp mayan only wanted paying at the end of the holiday ) - but well worth having at $63 for 2 weeks whilst at reception noticed loads of offers to upgrade to another hotel for free for periods of up to 5 days - we decided to investigate further with a view to maybe looking at another part of the dr but ( unfortunately ) we decided to sleep on it the following day we went back to try to arrange an upgrade with guest services but unfortunately the only offers still available were for 1 night only - however as the upgrade to gbp cayo levantado included a free whale watching trip we decided to go for it we actually had to check out and put any luggage that we did not want to take into a secure storage area , which was not , as anyone could walk in when the porters had it open i will review this trip under the gbp cayo levantado review section on our return to punta cana we were given a complimentary upgrade to the ambar section - again the porter was on the ball getting us and our luggage across to our new room - 62201, nicely positioned between the beach and the main bar/buffet areas the room was a little musty due to a problem they had obviously had with water leaking from the balcony above which had resulted in some of the ceiling paint peeling off but we decided we could live with it i went to use the complimentary room safe but could not get it to work now , my second moan , it apparently needed a small key to activate the touch pad electronics which we should have been given on our second check in but had not i spent about 3 hours and several journeys on the site trams travelling between the ambar reception and the main reception at punta cana trying to get this key , both sets of reception staff denying responsibility and fobbing me off they even wanted a second lot of money finally got it sorted when a manager got involved at the end of the first week we got back from the beach to find that our room keys were not working - the maid had to let us in went to reception who looked puzzled but just reactivated the keys for our actual leaving date the following morning we found a note pushed under our door asking me to contact the reception manager urgently about our departure arrangements - again a couple of tram rides ensued before i saw the main reception manager who explained that the confusion over surnames on the original bus ride from the airport , had led to us only being booked in for a but he quickly resolved the issue at the end of the two weeks departure was painless - porters were well organised and got us back to the pick up point and the coach journey and check in were smooth prior to a good flight back to the uk only issues were a long wait on the tarmac due to a couple of passengers arguing about overweight luggage and a non working toilet on our side of the aircraft which meant a long detour from our seats now to specifics : food - buffet at punta cana was ok but the buffet at the ambar was distinctly better particularly the freshly cooked fish and meats area and the sweets were to die for a la carte - we visited 5 a la cartes over the 2 weeks best we tried was the fish restaurant , el pescador , my wife really enjoyed that one excellent food and service el charro ( mexican ) was also very good with some excellent fajitas , and entertaining staff the italian , porto fino , was also very good although we felt that we were rushed thru a bit the other italian , whose name escapes me , was also very good with a more relaxed atmosphere the worst of the a la cartes we visited was the garden grill , simply because the steak i had was very tough , although the presentation/service was excellent and my wife was happy with her shrimp kebab we missed out on our visit to the ambar gourmet restaurant , don pablo , due to a touch of too much sun but others we talked with , said it was very good snack bars - generally ok for breakfast/lunch - very crowded before 1:30pm but much better after 2:00pm - the usual fare of salads , chicken , burgers and hot dogs bars - we found generally excellent service at all the bars , whether you waved a $$ bill or not the main bar at the punta cana was our favourite you sometimes had to wait at the pool bars particularly the second week when it was extremely busy definitely worth taking insulated mugs as it reduced the number or trips needed to the bar very useful if you spent most of the holiday on the beach as we did pools - clean but extremely crowded - the second week people were reserving  sunbeds with shades before it was even light - we did not spend much time by the pools usually only after 4:00pm the adults only pool at the ambar seemed to be the most crowded of all beach - beautiful golden sand but very crowded - all sun loungers with shade gone by 10:00am and very difficult to get beds after 11:00am for uk readers imagine blackpool on a bank holiday walking north of the property seemed to be the best bet to find some spacesea - clean - some weed made worse by the wind we experienced most of the 2 weeks lovely to swim in , shelving quite rapidly snorkelling from the beach non - existent - apparently anything of a decent size is taken by the spear fishermen weather - rained quite heavily the first two days in the morning but otherwise not too much rain wind was blowing quite strongly some days which kept you cool on the beach but made the danger of sunburn very real also had some cloudy days , particularly a couple of afternoons , and , disappointingly , our last day in conclusion , had a good holiday but would not go back to this hotel/region because of the sheer number of people at the time of year 
all you need to know having just returned from a weeks vacation at the grand bahia ( march 7-14) , i decided to answer some of the questions in qa format that previous reviews did not address and of course give you my throughts on the resort as a whole q1: which area/rooms should i request the resort has 4 sections , the front section is for club golden - villa 1- 10 and 20-29 is up by the beach , pool , a restaurant that serves both lunch and breakfast , and a few snack bars villas 1, 2, 4, 23, 21, 20 are the closest , with villa 1 and 20 likely providing some views of the ocean if you are ocean side villas 3, 5, 6, 25, 24, 22 would also be good the buildings are 2 and 3 storey high we stayed here and found easy navigating during the day but took the trolley at night to the shows and lobby bar the middle section runs from 11-19, and 30 to 39 i would not want to stay in units 33, 35, 37, 39 as they back on to constuction these units are half way between beach and the lobby they also have a club premier section quite a way from the beach but i suspect overlooks the golf course which is up at the entrance of the resort the final section is the ambar , which is down by the beach beside the golden section but is for adults only villas number 60-70 the best villas would be 60, 64, and 67, closest to the beach and pool q2: should i pay a premium for club golden location was definitely better - easy walking to the beach and only used the trolley 's a night to get to the lobby and show daily towel service meant we did not have to go to the hut to sign out towels extra dinner reservation was also nice i guess it depends on the extra cost if you got the best villa 's noted above , it would be well worth it what are the spa prices like i enjoyed a 1 hour massage on the beach - $66 us and well worth it you can also go to their spa location for a more private session did not appear to be any trouble getting an appointment in fact my session was walk inq4: what about wine if you like wine , i would try to bring some to enjoy in your room while you are there they stock pop and beer but no wine also the house wine a u brew , not bad but not good either i wish i had brought a couple of bottles to have enjoyed a glass while getting ready for dinner at night also , at the a la carte you can order a bottle - very reasonably priced , including a 2 glass spanish vintage for about $10us q5: kids club kids club was a disappointment staff member was nice but only one person for about 10 kids everyday 9-10 welcome , 10-11 and 11-12 would be 2 activities ( usually , beach games , minigolf , and pool ) and then 12-1 movies , and lunch 1-2 we did not use the service in the afternoon i just would have expected more structured activities - interesting crafts , learning the language , etc if you are picky , you wo not be impressed , but it was okay if you were just looking for a means to have a few hours to walk the beach or read quietly on the beach q5: what restaurants should you go to we really liked ( in this order ) he garden grill , the gourmet , and the japanese restaurant our friends also liked the italian and the mexican i did not enjoy the fish or the dominican restaurant q6: overall assessment in reading all the previous reviews i would agree with the consensus that the beach and surf are great - white sand , turquoise waters , lots of activities , great for long walks i should also note many topless ladies i would also agree with the postive reviews about the property - well maintained and quite beautiful rooms are good , quite spacious food is average , but acceptable as a whole ( as torontians we are used to pretty good restaurants and these would not compare ) we certainly did not gain any weight like we have on previous cruises with celebrity where i would rate the food as above average two of us in our group spent a day or so with churning stomachs service was also better than previous reviews shared - we experienced no issues , or waits , or problems overall good trip - but for the money ~$8500 ( for family of 4) , i would book my own flight and go a bit more upscale next time do not worry if you have booked this however , i think you will enjoy it but likely wo not rave about it hope this helps 
our attitudes determined our outcome we were at the gbpb march 1 - 8 having read everything posted on ta , and asked members many questions , we were well - armed with information it was important for us to know what we may be facing , as it was our first trip to the dr , and we are very appreciative of all the help that ta members gave us , so thank you , everyone the resort is clearly a beautiful sight there is no denying that it is one of the most beautiful resorts in the area we checked out several , and were pleased with our choice i will agree with what everyone has already said the place is huge that is a fact it is well manicured , clean , and aesthetically perfect actually , though , we found our way around fairly easily it took a couple of days , but we were all over the place in no time at all one time i got turned around , but i think it may have been the rum we were booked in the golden section , and when we arrived , we were told that they had upgraded us to ambar check in was quick , pleasant , and we were served cocktails while checking in we were taken soon after to the ambar section , and to bldg 68, room #68208 immediately upon opening the door , we could smell the most musty , unpleasant aroma the bellman also noticed it , as did the maid , who was at our door fortunately , i had brought the air fresheners , as suggested by ta members : ) however , this was more than any glade solid was going to fix we went into the room , and nearly slipped in a puddle of water the maid was confused , and mopped it up , but did not know what was causing it she sprayed the room , opened up the patio doors to air it out , and we agreed to see if it got better the next day , we were out all day when we arrived back to the room , more water we contacted the concierge , and they sent maintenance staff who did not have a clue where the water was coming from my husband is a pretty bright guy , and can fix nearly anything , so decided to help the maintenance man he tapped the wall , and noticed that the baseboard was very wet all of the wood was wet he helped the guy remove a ceiling panel , and found a serious leak in a water pipe , which obviously had been leaking into the hollow wall , and soaking into the wood about that time , we noticed other leaks in the bathroom , near the light fixture above the toilet , the shower , etc my husband spoke with the concierge again , and insisted on moving , as this was clearly going to take some time , and the wood was moldy they pleaded with us for patience , as they had no rooms left that night , but would move us first thing in the morning fine , we were not going to let it impact our trip the next morning , they came right away to move us to bldg 65, room # 65208 everything about it was wonderful the view was actually better , and we loved it our maid , quiskella , was the sweetest girl ever during the issue with the water , however , every single person we worked with , was absolutely wonderful they were helpful , apologetic , and worked hard to stay in communication as to the progress one other thing that happened , was while we were in a hurry to move to the new room , my husband emptied out the safe quickly , and mistakenly left my small jewelry box with all of myjewelry , wedding rings , diamond necklace , everything , inside the safe , behind the door jam when i was getting ready the next night for dinner , and realized it was gone , i was distraught , and so upset that i vomited my husband was beside himself trying to help me stay calm , and immediately contacted the ambar concierge the very helpful man , victor , called us back shortly afterward to let us know that the amazingly wonderful young canadian couple who were in our old room , ( #68208) had found my jewelry , and contacted security right away they had my jewelry locked in the vault , and we could claim it in the morning we did so , and went directly to their room to thank them personally this was all on day 2 of our vacation needless to say , after that experience , there was nothing that was going to spoil our vacation we decided that we were amongst incredible people , who were honest and kind , and we would not let any little incidental get in the way of that fortunately for us , we truly enjoyed everything about our trip certainly , there were things that we did like more than others , but we simply made a different choice if we did not like something the ambar pool  beach area : very nice place to relax , if you want quiet , with no activity , or music we sat around there at times , but usally went over to the volleyball area , golden pool area , or beach bars lots to do , entertainment , activity , etc the ala carte restaurants : we ate at don pablos , which we really liked , legourmet , , portofino , definately not for us , but we 're kind of fussy eaters , the garden grill , which was good , but not something we wanted twice everyone has different tastes , so it 's tough to say if a place is good or not good however , we really enjoyed the buffet off the ambar lobby it was always fantastic , and the food was hot i had grilled shrimp , and/or grilled lobster nearly every day the animacion team : wonderful group they work so hard , and really try to include anyone who looks like they want to have fun my husband and i are volleyball enthusiasts , and we were watching a large group of europeans form teams for a tournament one of the animacion staff saw us watching , and included us in the game the other players spoke little or no english , and we speak no french , but we all spoke volleyball by the way , our team took 1st place : ) we received medals , and bottles of rum entertainment : in general , we enjoyed it they work hard , and really are trying to please everyone we appreciated their work we enjoyed some incredible excursions , and we found a friend in wilkins , from the vip tour service he was great , and helpful no matter what one thing that i have to say , is that some very nice people on ta , like brenda lee - alberta , john brooklin , punta cana mike , and many , many others gave some of the best advice of all : go down there with a positive attitude , and a plan to have a great time , and it will be a wonderful trip thank you all for helping to make our vacation special 
helicopters flying overhead stayed from march 3rd the 10th golden club section near the beach food at restos not bad to good buffet just ok always found something to eat and enjoyed never had problems finding chairs at pool or beach easy check in and check out some good shows at night those helicopters continously flying overhead at the beach and pool they fly too low and too close and too often i 'm from a big noisy polluted city and when on vacation , i want to hear the wind thru the palm trees and the waves crashing on the sand at times i felt like i was lying on a beach bed in the middle of an airport the banana boat with its noisy motor and stinky gaz also comes in too close to where we swim in the ocean they are several other caribbean destinations where such noise polluting activities are not allowed so close to the resorts i dont mind the music and/or the organized pool activities at the resort because they are of short duration and you can always find a quieter spot around the pool or go to the beach but , you cannot get away from the noise flying over you nor that stupid banana boat going back and forth if only it go further outwards in the ocean like at many other resorts in the caribbean , then it would be more tolerable much easier to find an equivalent 5 star resort in the caribbean or mexico without the air traffic and polluting banana boats 
all in all a good holiday although we were at the gran bahia principe end jan for two weeks and did not intend to write a review , after reading some of the reviews below , i think the following would be helpful to anyone going there : firstly , check - in was irritating as the person was distracted by colleagues and other guests , but that may have been because we were tired secondly , if you are going to hire the safe be sure you get the receipt for reasons listed later we did not spend the day at any of the pools so cannot comment on finding a spot but we did not have any problem finding loungers on the beach , it was busy close to the ocean but further back was quiet we took advantage of an offer to go to another hotel for two , five or six nights for $100 00 a day and went to samana so came home with $400 i guess bavaro gets overbooked and we were apprehensive about the return from samana but there were absolutely no problems re - booking in , so i would recommend it if you have the time samana is very quiet and after the bustle of bavaro , we found it more to our liking it was this trip that caused the problem with the safe we were reimbursed three days cost of the safe ( $18 00) because it is free at samana our relatives from england did not get a receipt for the cost of the safe when they checked in ( $64 00 for two weeks ) and were not on the list to get the $18 only a small amount but they were practically accused of lying about paying for the safe and they did not have a receipt we think someone pocketed the original payment which would never have been discovered if we had not gone to samana they did get the $18 00 after we returned and the person in charge of that department said they were going to have to launch an investigation another thing i have to mention is when on the coach to samana i realised i had left my purse underneath the table at the restaurant while having breakfast the courier on the bus ( from venezuela but i 've forgotten his name ) called the bavaro and my purse had been found and handed in and we were reunited upon return , so there are certainly honest workers there i have to recommend carla who was very helpful in this regard and who is very professional i would also like to mention laura who answered my email requesting rooms close to our relatives within 24 hours , and we were booked into the same building this is a very nice hotel but i do not think we would return because it is too big and noisy for us 
the tale of two resorts let me preface my review by saying that this was the sixth all - inclusive vacation for my wife and me in the last 10 years it was our second trip to the dominican republic and our second stay at a gran bahia principe property trip outline : we were part of a group of eight that booked for two weeks at the gran bahia principe bavaro six of us had stayed at the gbp san juan together four years ago , and it was that experience that prompted us to book at gbp bavaro as a group we are firm believers that a vacation is what you make it life is too short to be whining and complaining about nitpicky things due to overbooking at gbp bavaro during our second week , we took advantage of an excursion offered by the resort and spent two days ( one night ) at the gran bahia principe cayacoa at samana upon our return we were ??pgraded? to the ambar section at punta cana travel to and from the dr : we travelled by air transat out of vancouver and the flight was pretty much what we expected we were through customs and on the bus in less than an hour upon arrival at punta cana there was some confusion once we reached the resort , as resort officials spent an hour shuffling us to three different registration desks before we could actually register things went quite smoothly on the trip to samana and back , and on our return trip to canada resort in general : as mentioned by previous posters , the resort is quite large ? something like 1,800 rooms in a series of ( mostly ) three - storey buildings having said that , we didn?? have too much trouble getting around , although we did use the trolleys on occasion our suite was in the middle of the resort , about 5- minute walk to the beach and about a 5- minute walk to the main lobby the diamond club pool was right out our front door and we spent most of our afternoons there a very beautiful resort and well maintained beaches and pools : during our ??eisure days? we tended to spend the mornings at the beach and the afternoons at the pool the beach is very nice , with soft sand and plenty of palapas even though we were a group of eight , we rarely had trouble finding a suitable spot to park ourselves ? close to both sun and shade , near the water and ( most importantly ) close to a bar the only pool we went to on the bavaro side was the diamond cub pool , which was smaller , but a whole lot quieter than the main pool once again , there was a good mix of sun and shade and we never seemed to have trouble finding a spot even thought the resort has rules prohibiting the ??aving? loungers with beach towels , it is a very common occurrence if you find a spot you like , it is wise to get there early and save your spaces buffet restaurants : we had breakfast at the main buffet restaurant twice and supper there three times it is very large and can be quite noisy at times the food is good and there is a good selection service is also very good one draw - back to the main buffet is the lack of an outdoor seating area we ate breakfast at the italian restaurant several times , primarily because we were able to sit outside the selection was good , but quite a bit more restricted than the main restaurant we had a lot of our lunches at the beach - side grill lots of seats and a small but tasty selection ( excellent roast chicken ) a la carte restaurants : we e - mailed ahead and received pre - booking of the a la carte restaurants upon arrival , we already had reservations at the french , japanese , argentinean ( beach - side grill ) , garden grill ( steakhouse ) , seafood , italian and mediterranean restaurants most followed the same system with an appetizer buffet and a la carte ordering for the main course and dessert the french and mediterranean restaurants were a la carte appies and main course the japanese had a set menu that was prepared in front of you in all cases the food was flavourful and well - presented , although the portions were quite small in the french restaurant ( i had steak and lobster the steak was about 2 oz and the lobster tail wasn?? much larger ) our preferences ( in order from favourite to least favourite ) were the garden grill , mediterranean , japanese , italian , seafood , french and argentinean excursions : we took a one - day guided tour into santo domingo it was a long day , but well worth it we got to visit the tomb of christopher columbus , the columbus museum and the oldest cathedral in the americas , as well as a walking tour through part of the old section of town and a stop at the presidential palace there was also time set aside for shopping at la romana ? on the trip in to santo domingo ? the cost was just under $70 per person , which included all applicable entrance fees and lunch we took a cab into downtown bavaro for a beer at steve?? corner bar and lunch at capitan cooks seafood restaurant the beer at steve?? was great ? good atmosphere on a busy street corner , so there?? lots to see lunch at capitan cooks was ( in my opinion ) a waste of time prices were high , the quality of food was not very good and the service was average at best two didn?? want to order after looking at the prices and one other sent her food back because she couldn?? eat it ( rubbery calamari ) i ordered ceviche and calamari , but i can?? tell you what it was like , because i never did get my order maybe i should have hassled one of the servers to get my meal , but after seeing the quality of the calamari that what one of the other members of the group got , i decided to keep quite and save $25 the hotel also offers free shuttle service to plaza palma real , a high - end mall in bavaro there is a cigar and rum shop at the mall that we found a good place to pick up smokes and rum good quality and selection and competitive prices here is also a hard rock caf? there if you have a hankering for a $20 burger and fries gbp bavaro experience : overall , we had a very enjoyable stay on the bavaro side of the complex there were a few minor problems , but nothing that impacted our stay the staff was courteous and professional ambar experience : the only real ??owner? our trip was our upgrade to the ambar section the ambar resort itself is beautiful , with a large , bright lobby and excellent food at the buffet and a la carte restaurants there is also a cigar lounge near the main lobby that is supposed to be open daily from 11 a it looks to have a good selection of cigars , but the two times i went to check it out ? once just after noon and once at about 5 p it was closed we had a few problems with our room when we checked in ? an in - room safe that didn?? work and a leaky toilet - - but both were fixed within the first day 
great drinks , beautiful beach i stayed at the gran bahia for a week over valentine 's day i traveled with my boyfriend and a couple that we are close friends with overall , we had a terrific time since we relied upon the trip advisor reviews in booking our trip , i wanted to leave feedback about our experience we booked our stay through cheapcaribbean which provided our hotel transfers , flight , and hotel reservations it turned out to be a good value for the quality of the trip cheap caribbean was very easy to deal with and would definitely recommend using them the hotel is near the airport ( ~20 min so transfers are a breeze the hotel itself is beautiful , as many others have mentioned but , it is so large and the layout is kind of confusing it helped us to ride around on the trolley just to get a sense of where things were in fact , by riding around , we found a pool on the punta cana side ( ) , near the villas in the 40?? , that was open to everyone that pool had teak chairs with pads and was quieter , so we preferred that to the large pool of course , the only drawback is that it was not near the beach i put a question mark near the comment about the punta cana side because it is literally impossible to tell/remember which side is which i?? not sure why they designed the property that way but really its fine , we hung out in both lobbies at different times the check in process was okay , but definitely a little frustrating although we requested so , we weren?? given a room in the same villa as our friends we asked to be reassigned but the front desk said that wasn?? possible when we were taken to our rooms , our room was on the ground floor with two double beds and theirs was not ready for them unbeknownst to each other we both complained and asked to be reassigned by chance , we were placed in rooms next to each other??e found out later in the day so we were very happy about our room assignment but actually we only got it by pure chance we had gold bands which meant nothing except for we were in the villa closest to the beach that was the perfect place to be because you could roll out of bed , go eat right there at pescatore ( seafood restaurant which had breakfast buffet ) and then go lay on the beach we wouldn?? have to take the tram until the evening when we?? go to the lobby to eat or to have drinks the drinks at the bahia were amazing i think they were the best of any all inclusive that we??e been to and we??e been to a lot the different options were great , there was always something to try and really everything was good the food was good??ot great the a la carte dinners were so much better than the buffet in fact , we didn?? eat dinner at the buffet again after we had it once one of the most important things is to get dinner reservations set up with guest services it is a horrible procedure??ou have to go , wait , they act like there?? not space , you get annoyed , and finally? you get a reservation? its worth waiting for if they say you can only have 3 reservations per week , don?? take no for an answer go back and talk to someone else or , if you??e traveling with others , make you reservations for 4 people all under your room number , and then have your friends make some for 4 people under their room number if you can?? get reservations by any means , get creative for example , one night , we tipped the host at the japanese restaurant $20 and got in trust me , this is so worth it although it is annoying to spend time on reservations during your vacation , the food there is a lot better and getting into the a la cartes made our trip just to elaborate on the dinner options : japanese was really awesome the food was good , and the service was really good too we also loved the mexican restaurant it is so hilarious they have a waiter who walks around with a holster of shot glasses and a bottle of tequila to give you shots after our dinner he broke out in song and had us all laughing and dancing around with him valentine?? day was really fun at the hotel as well they had a whole special display set up with different drinks ( champagne , special martinis , etc they even had a man dressed up as cupid walking around and shooting everyone with arrows it was great we took an atv tour??ooked with people on the beach who work the water sports it was a great time and i?? highly recommend it the only thing is they take you around the country side and you visit a school that is tons of fun , i?? just saying it because we didn?? know , other people in our group did , and they had brought supplies i?? trying to get the address to send them things , and i??e emailed to the hotel several times without hearing back that is frustrating because we took a picture with the kids that i?? love to send them along with some school supplies hopefully we??l hear back about that i just think that is something good to know in advance , so you are prepared for it all in all , we had a really great time on this trip the beach is so relaxing and , honestly , every member of the staff goes out of their way to make sure that you have fun all of the bartenders , wait staff , and housekeepers do the very best they can there are some things that do cause stress , and they are caused by the size of the resort and the number of guests but , whenever you feel yourself getting stressed , just stop whatever it is that you??e doing and head over to the bar for a dirty monkey , capparinia , or presedente then it??l all be better : - p if the price is right , go here you??l have a great vacation 
wedding at bahia principe first i would like to say that this resort has absolutely stunning grouds , is very clean and the rooms are very beautiful we had a great vacation all together , but i would like to write this review for people who are thinking of getting married here the review is very long but could be beneficial to some : me and my husband just got married at the bahia principe feb 1st 2008, and i though it would be very important to write this review for couples thinking about getting married there we were a group of 50 travelling together for the wedding the plane ride was very smooth from to to dr everything went well at the airport and the bus ride to the bahia , they even stopped at a little shop so we could purchase a few drinks for the ride for those who do not know , the resort is divided in two mirror sections , with two different receptions ( bavaro and punta cana ) when we arrived at the resort , the bus dropped us off at the wrong reception (50 ppl with luggage ) the bavaro side arranged for little trolleys to come and pick us up with our luggage , so no big deal when we got to the punta cana side , we were told that my grandmother ( which is 78 yrs old ) did not have a room because the resort was overbooked they offered to send her at another resort for a few nights , which we declined since we did not want her to be all alone at a different resort so my parents took her into their room , hoping the problem would be corrected the next day when we got to our room , we were expecting a welcome fruit basket and a letter from the wedding coordinator ( as mentionned in the wedding package we purchased ) it was not there , but we though it was not a big deal : we were there to have a good time with our friends and family and to get married we were already on cloud 9 so we did not mind not having a fruit basket the next day , we tried to book some a la carte restaurants and some tours for people in our group , it took 1 1/2 hours for a girl in our group to manage to book our reservations we understand we are a big group ( we were booking for 10 ppl ) but we still think 1 1/2 hrs is a long time by then , my grandmother and my dad go to the reception to see if she has a room yet , they tell her she has to deal with the other reception because she was booked with bavaro instead of punta cana when she gets to bavaro , they tell her she has to go to punta cana it was like that for all the room troubles we had that week nobody was willing to help , and they would always refer us to the other reception , which you could imagine , got quite a bit frustrating i was able to find marianna ( the wedding planner ) and she tells me we should 've had a letter from her in our room , and we missed our appointment with her she asks that we meet with her later that day before the trip , i had also sent letters to marianna by e - mail , that contained all the information and scedule for the day of the wedding , and i asked for her to put it in every room ( i gave her names for each rooms ) she told me she would do it that morning , the letters were not sent , i asked her several times that week and it never got done later that day ( tuesday ) , we met with gaby ( her assistant ) and we confirmed everything we wanted for the wedding ( the restaurant , flowers , cake , music , decorations etc ) we give her the legal documents we need to get married and the payment of 2000 00$ for the wedding package everything goes very well and we are very excited we were getting married on friday , and on thursday night ( around 7h30) marianna calls my room to let me know they will be changing the location of the reception to a different restaurant now , i 'm not very happy with this , because we had to let 50 people know about the location , and i do not have time ( on my wedding day ) to call everybody 's room and let them know about the change so i ask her why she changed us ( i had confirmation for the garden grill for more that 4 months ago ) she tells me there is a group of 150 people and they need the big room at the garden grill to make a long story short , it took us 3 hours to 'discuss ' with her to make arrangements for a new location , and to find out why we were 'bumped ' from our location it was very frustrating the night before the wedding , and put a bit of a damper on our week ( the next day , after we were married , we got back to our room for a bit before the reception , and we saw that the garden grill had a wedding for about 50 ppl , not a meeting with 150 ppl ) finally we got the italian restaurant ( the food was ok , but not great ) for our reception the next day ( wedding day ) , i had a hair and nail appointment at 1:00, my nails were perfect but my hair was a mess she was done by 3:00 and i was getting married at 4:00, so you can imagine my panic i still had to get my make up done , my hair redone and my dress on finally ( thanks to my wonderfull sisters and bridesmaids everything turned out perfect the rest of the wedding day was wonderfull the photographer is absolutely amazing ( ernesto ) , the ceremony went without a hitch , the reception was great ( except for the waiters getting drunk by trying to put up a show , more annoying than anything ) all in all we had a great wedding day if you are looking to get married at this resort , you be the judge for yourself , after reading this review would i recommend this resort for a wedding i would not recommend this resort for any organized events more than once , we felt like numbers this resort is great for a couple alone who would like to spend a week to relax and enjoy the beach but nothing that would involve dealing closely with the staff 
beautiful grounds but resort could be better organized last year we stayed are the riu macao and absolutely loved it staff was great , food , activities etc we opted to go back to punta cana this year and stay at the bahia principe we traveled with 2 other couples and an infant so here is my unbiased review : pros : - beautiful grounds - frequent tram/trolley service throughout resort - clean rooms - stocked refrigerator - quick check - out cons : - resort is huge which i think makes it hard for hotel staff to manage the constant inflow and outflow of guests - horrible check - in process (3pm check in time more like 5 or 6 pm ) - buffet food was mediocre and repetitive - took all day for them to get us a crib in the room for our baby i had requested it when i booked the trip directly through the hotel - if you dont have the right color bracelet , then you are in for a tough time hotel staff seems to focus on what kind of wristband you have and that basically determines what you have access to there are probably 10 or so different colors for bands and i am not sure what each one meant make sure that when you check in you ask what the wristband means and what you can and ca not do some advice - we avoided the large pool down by the beach and stuck to the 2 pools by the italian restaurant il cappricio quiet pools with swim up bar and activites - forgo the buffet for lunches and breakfast and eat at the italian restaurant ( il cappricio ) for lunch and breakfast ( no reservations required ) - make your reservations for the formal dinners/restaurants when you check in ( we liked the japanese hibachi and the italian restaurant ) final thoughtsoverall the resort is nice but i think its problems stem from the size of the resort there are many guests and the staff is not organized enough to handle such a crowd 
good choice , especially for families i went to this resort last month with my pregnant wife and my 4- year old daughter we were looking for a nice place to relax in the sun at a reasonable price we were happy with our choice the rooms were clean and in good shape ( and hopefully you wo not be spending all your time in your room ) service was uneven , but generally good there were not a lot of fluent english speakers on staff , but if you were polite and patient it was not a problem the grounds were beautiful the beach was the nicest i 've seen at this type of resort the best feature , bar none , was that this was the first resort i 've been to where you did not have to get up at the crack of dawn to claim pool chairs the food was o the buffet was fine the reservation restuarants were not terrible , but were somewhat disappointing for a large all - inclusive resort catering to package tourists , they do a good job it is a very good choice for a low - key family vacation 
not the greatest experience stayed there for 2 weeks feb 3 to 17 in the royal golden area , building 21 would rate the experience a 5 out of 10 airport was a zoo really crowded and seemed disorganized we managed to survive and found our bus to the resort in time on arrival we were directed to the golden club guest service salon ( a small 4 desk room with 4 customer service people and about 20 guests waiting in line so talk to them ) to arrange for our dinner reservations and a safe in our room the vacation started of on sort of a negative note as we were there just when theft of a purse from one of the guests occurred the lady had her purse sitting right beside her on a table when her purse was snatched it happened so fast i sympathize with that lady because it happened in an area which was supposed to be secure i read an earlier guest comment where it was said this was not the hotel 's fault i disagree , and i think it is wrong to marginalize this person 's shocking experience because it should not have happened in such a place we found out that such things are common in this area , and it was surprising that more is not being said about it by travel agencies after that shocker , we went to our assigned room , a second floor unit , and waited for our baggage to be brought by the porter as instructed it never arrived , and after waiting 6 hours we went back to the arrival area and our baggage was still sitting on the driveway in front we took it to our room on our own rather than leave it there any longer it 's a long way with two large suitcases our room was a little shopworn but adequate there were some things missing that we were told would be there such as a coffeemaker , bottled water , and facecloths in the bathroom we called about this but only got the water never did see a coffeemaker , and facecloths seemed to be in short supply the whole time we were there the bathtub plug never worked , but shower was used mainly anyway so that was 'nt a big deal maid service was not bad , although the room was left unmade until late afternoon most days grounds and buildings look really nice , and there seems to be a lot of attention given to them by work crews which are always there the pool was really clean , and there were lots of lounge chairs available around the pool it gets crowded after about 10:30 am , and getting a shaded area is not easy because they are usually all taken early on it also gets pretty noisy after 3:00pm when the loud music gets turned on , but that 's probably a good time to head to the beach anyway the beach is expansive , with beautiful soft sand , and lots of shaded huts to use , although the whole area is just a sea of blue chaise lounges row on row really a lot of people there we ate at both buffet and a la carte restaurants and had few complaints lots of variety and mostly good quality food one or two exceptions where a steak was unchewable or had a fossilized coating of hollandaise sauce pasted to it servers were really friendly and seemed to be trying hard to please everyone once in a while there was a really strong sewer smell in the main buffet restaurant at breakfast time do not know what that was all about , but it did not happen often getting around is not too difficult because there are shuttles running every few minutes , so it saves walking the kilometer or so from one side of the place to the other there are some really nice things about this resort there are also some not so nice things the worst situation when we were there had to do with the place being overbooked people were arriving with nowhere to put them , or putting them in a part of the resort they had not expected to be put they were offering people incentives to relocate to another resort all the time we were there in retrospect , the place is just too big and too crowded for our taste , and if we had to do it over again we would not have chosen this one in fairness to the hotel , it was definitely overbooked , and i think staff were just overwhelmed because of that now as to why it was so severely overbooked , that 's another story this should not be happening 
not for the american traveller i read nearly every review before booking this trip and understood the good and not - so - good about this place as an american traveler who has been to a lot of destinations , i have to say that this trip was average and i would not return i guess i was hoping that our experience would be like the great reviews and not like the bad ones bottom line is , this is a huge resort and the nice touches that many experienced travelers expect are just not going to be met as everyone agrees , the grounds , pool and beach are stunningly beautiful and well - maintained the accommodations are very nice and the maids were fantastic we did tip $3/day and also brought chocolate and clothes to give to them the food was average , at best we did enjoy our diner at the japanese and mediterranean restaurant and the french was decent ( but took forever to get our food ) the regular lunch and dinner buffets were well below the average american meal - - my food in college was better i am not at all a picky eater and found that the chicken was the only decent food the breakfast each morning was the only good meal of the day - - but we ate at the italian restaurant which is only available to club diamond guests in conclusion , if you do not mind big crowds , fair food and some disappointment , then book this resort but , if you have certain expectations and want more than an average vacation , look elsewhere again , we did not have a bad vacation , but it was not great either 
gran bahia just returned from a short four days w/my daughter a girl trip that both of us really enjoyed overall the resort is beautiful and immaculate but beware , as all other postings advise , it is very large and spread out this was not a problem for us , but could see how it would be for some - elderly or those with small children there is a tram that runs non - stop until 3 am and you never have to wait more than a minute or two for their arrival we never used the tram and enjoyed the walk to and from the beach everyday but a lot of people do use the tram the food is well , for lack of a better word , pretty disgusting i have never had so much grease in my life , but if you are not into the weird looking concoctions with american names ( like lasagna with brown marinara sauce ) then that is what you have - endless burgers , fries and hotdogs nothing really tastes good the fresh fruit was amazing especially the pineapple scrambled eggs at breakfast were runny and undercooked , etc just not good food and no way to put this nicely for the price , you would expect more we were only there for 4 days , so they told us that would only entitle us to have one reservation at the four gourmet restaurants hey , i did not think this was fair - i paid my money like everyone else drinks were good and not watered down no service at the beach for drinks , but a lot of peddlers rooms were ok - nothing fancy - a little buggy and very , very humid - no shower doors or curtain - just open air shower in bathroom , which made for even more humidity but you have these problems at most caribbean locations pillows were completely flat - i had more of a pillow by folding up my towel and using it for a pillow the entertainment was your usual cheesy , but fun shows there was a good reggae , caribbean type house band that played every night in the town square the employees worked hard - but the domenicans almost seemed to be very shy - they do not offer conversation and you have to really engage them in order to get a word out of their mouths but their hard work is evident in the cleanliness of the place we did not find the service to be bad at all we did get interaction when we said we were from st louis - they all know albert pujols the beach and pools were beautiful , clean and relaxing that is all we came for anyway , so the other shortcomings did not really bother us if you like the sun and the sand , this resort was perfect - one of the prettiest beaches i have been to next to beaches in negril beach chairs at pool and beach are plentiful there are a good deal of shady areas on the beach that are shielded by palm trees , yet you still feel like you 're on the beach skip the trip to the shopping market - overpriced stores that sell nothing but overpriced clothes and jewelry we had to go because of hard rock and collecting their shot glasses , otherwise the trip would have been useless there are nice little shops in the resort town square area that we felt were pretty reasonable the shuttle from the resort to the mall is free , but you have to sit through pick up and drop off at other resorts it was interesting to see the other resorts and the town itself there is nothing to do off resort besides this or golf of all the resorts we drove through , this one was by far the nicest and most - well kept all in all , i think you would enjoy this resort , but it is very big 
great resort after using trip advisor several times for previous trips , i know to take a lot of the reviews with a grain of salt with our trip to punta cana , it was no different i think some will complain about anything and everything we went to the gran bahia principe for 4 nights and stayed on the punta cana side i took the advice of others and learned the layout of the resort quickly - without this it is easy to get lost and confused a bit - since the hotel is two hotels in one the reception was wonderful and our room was ready when we got there we took a cab from the airport for 33$ and did not have to wait on a bus to fill up the room was great , very clean and perfect for us the beach here is beautiful the weather was great and the food was perfect with so many choices i do not know how someone can not find something they like we did leave a couple of bucks for our maid for extra stocking of the fridge and then worked great overall the trip was exactly what we were looking for - a getaway from the drab and dreary weather of feb - for some sunshine and relaxation okay , now with the negative - the language barrier is frustrating - i will admit - we travel often to the islands and i guess we expect at least the main staff to speak english - this was the most difficult for our little knowledge of spanish - we were able to get by , but a lot of questions about the island and it 's culture went unanswered do to lack of understanding - i am thankful there were no emergencies , b/c i could see that being a big problem - in punta cana - americans actually seem to be the minority vacationers - we noticed many french , russian and german families - who also had difficulty with the language of the staff - that was the only downside - but all the drinks and plenty of sunshine - made up for the lack of communication with the resort staff and we had a great time 
but bugs the place is beautiful to look at it is absolutely huge so if you have little children be prepared to take the trolley that the hotel provides to get people from the reception area to their rooms it is at least a 10 minutes walk from reception to the beach area food was good i actually liked the buffet restaurant the best because that gave a great selection of local dominican cuisine beach is gorgeous and goes on for miles in both directions the problems of the resort are as follows : 1) smell of sewage around the outdoor theater 2) construction going on from very early morning right next to the bungalows 3) bugs in the rooms - not just mosquitoes - but small roaches and ants rooms are clean so maybe it is just from the humid climate 4) rooms were not made up till between 5 and 6 pm even though we had left the room at 9 am every morning 5) because the resort is so huge there is constant small diesel truck traffic going on inside the resort on the walkways these trucks are a constant source of annoyance if you are trying to walk and the diesel fumes are gag - producing they also drive very fast and if you have small children , i would make sure that that they stay near to you when walking 6) very limited activities going on and if there was stuff going on , it either started late or not at all 7) there is one internet cafe where they ask you to buy a code that entitles you to one hour of internet that is usable for a 5- day period it cost $12 us the internet connection is extremely slow so it takes 10-15 minutes just to get your mail after the 3rd day , i still had 20 minutes left on my account but was told that they had reset all the parameters the day before so i had lost my 20 minutes after complaining the gentlemen told me i could have 20 minutes back but that i had to use it right now other people complained as well i thought this very cheap and annoying i do not think that we will go back to the gran bahia punta cana but we love the dominican republic and will probably go back to the club med instead 
overall very good we arrived home today from a week long stay at the gran bahia principe first of all when we booked our vacation in october the reviews for this hotel were very good but as our trip approached reviews went downhill this made me nervous and i really did not know what to expect but lets just say this resort is great this was the first trip for my husband and i to the carribean and we went along with close friends of ours who were on their fifth trip first things first we booked with a local sell off vacations office in st john 's newfoundland after much research we picked the resort , decided we really wanted the diamond club upgrade and all they had to do was book the trip i stressed to the agent we wanted club diamond , we went over the features many times and it appeared to be a done deal 3 weeks before my holiday i emailed the resort to confirm our honeymoon upgrade and mentioned club diamond only to receive an email back saying honeymoon upgrade was fine but they had no record of club diamond upgrade i called sell off and they again confirmed our upgrade but i was told she would get the agent we were dealing with to look into it it took over a week for us to hear back only to find out she had made a mistake booking our trip and did not include the upgrade and because it was her fault there was nothing they could do ( not sure where that logic comes from ) my husband called and was very upset as we would not have booked at such a large resort if not for the upgrade anyway after many emails and phone calls we get an email from laura at the resort that everything was sorted out we found out a week before our departure that our flight times had changed and we were now departing st john 's at 9:20 pm this was a huge pain as we now did not arrive at our hotel until after 4 am on tuesday thus losing an entire day and night ( which we paid for ) upon check - in our friends ended up having their upgraded bracelets available and for some reason we had regular bracelets ( even though we had been the ones complaining ) when i mentioned my email with laura no one had any idea who i was talking about and i never did get to meet her ( even though i had brought her a little present for her assistance ) the upgrade was settled the next day although the guy at the desk made it seem like he was doing us a huge favor by fixing everything and reminded us that it would normally cost an extra $200 per bracelet ( which we had already paid ) none of us had diamond club rooms upon arrival but were ok with it was we were happy to be in villa 39 next to the lobby and fairly close to the diamond pool where we practically lived for the week after things were sorted out our first real day everything was fabulous staff were friendly , our maid was great ( money goes a long way at this resort ) , one day we tipped her $10 and got a dozen beer in our fridge and a bottle of rum like i said we spend most of our days at the diamond pool as it was a little less busy and very close to the italian restaurant which you can go to breakfast and lunch with the diamond upgrade and it is 100 times better than the buffett we found the al la carte decent and our friends raved it was the best of any resorts they had been to italian is good , grill was awesome , mexican and bbq were decent as for other complaints yes the review is huge but you know this when you book it the maps are fairly straight forward and there is no reason you should get lost the beach is far from the lobby and diamond areas but the trams only take a minute and they may stink but come on it does the job as for a purse getting stolen i do not think this is the fault of the resort and no matter where you are if you leave your purse unattended there is a good chance some dishonest person is gonna steal it i actually felt quite fine leaving my beach bag at the pool with a few dollars tip money , our cameras , clothes , room keys etc in them and we never had anyone go through them and nothing was ever missing several times we left money around the room and it was always there after the maid left we did 2 extra outtings during the trip the first was parasailing which was so much fun and not the least bit as scary as i thought it would be and the second was renting buggies with a ranch type tour business ( rancho something was the name ) this was fun although not the fast pace buggying we have done in the past first of all it was pretty slow and the machines were not in the greatest shape but then they brought us to a deserted beach for a swim and break then we did and tour of a cave and actually got to swim in it which was awesome and that alone was worth the $65 per person i would recommend this but be warned you are not gonna go crazy it is more of a slow relaxing site seeing tour , the guide from this tour had the best english of the whole trip and had a great sense of humor it was though heart breaking to see the kids chasing the buggies and the bus looking for a dollar or even just a high five i wish i had brought some candies to throw to them but will definately know next time ) , overall the vacation was amazing and we would definately go to gran bahia again next time we discussed upgrading to amber as it is adults only and actually the same resort which we did not know when booking we found there were usually a few kids around in the morning although they would usually disappear in the afternoons ( not sure why ) i will never book with sell off vacations again as i can not even tell you how unnecessarily complicated they made the whole experience as an added note this morning as we picked up the travellers from the other resorts we heard some real horror stories some of these resorts are not what they claim to be and i honestly got shivers just stopping outside to pick people up one group were overcharged on their hotel bill and they hotel made the sign them visa slip or were told they would not give them the slip they needed to get the bus to the airport 
guard your belongings we spent two weeks feb 3- -17 at this resort we booked first week with our two daughters and their families at golden , second week at ambar we paid for the entire family as a gift to them - - over $20k in total things got nasty two hours after arrival when we were attempting to get our room in the same building as the rest of our family ( we had specifically asked for this well in advance of our trip there ) while in the golden concierge office arranging the room switch , my purse was snatched from a table right beside me both passports , all my personal id , credit cards , and a large sum of cash - - - - - - gone what a frightening situation for us at first , neither the hotel concierges nor our tour representative ( apple tours ) believed us we were quickly brushed off with comments like your fault , not ours , the hotel never has this problem , plus you should not expect any help from us , etc , etc it was like they just wanted us to go away it took two days to get someone 's attention - - - after considerable pleading , the next day we were assigned a concierge to help us the hotel finally helped us get to a policia nationale station to make a report , and arranged to get us to the canadian embassy in santo domingo to get temporary passports , otherwise we would not have been able to leave the country just the trip to santo domingo required one entire day because it 's 4 hours away by the 5th day of our vacation , we managed to get the temporary passports , have money wired to us , etc , so almost half of or vacation was ruined making all these arrangements the final week at ambar was not without its problems either ( seems like we were jinxed ) when we transferred to our ambar suite , the patio door could not be opened or closed because it was broken the air conditioner did not work because it is linked electrically with the patio door , the safe was broken and had to be taken apart to be repaired and last but not least , one evening some pipes burst in the bathroom ceiling and there was an incredible flood ( we had to wait until thaty midnight while the ceiling was being dismantled and pipes were fixed so our vacation turned out to be just one disaster after another we did learn , however , that this hotel and most others have a serious theft problem , but they do not make it known and wo not admit it when it happens - - - and we learned from a good many others who had things stolen - - - cameras , ipods , clothing , money , etc the airport is apparently particularly bad because baggage handling is quite hapahazard , and it 's not uncommon to learn that baggage has been opened either on arrival or on departure other than a systemic problem with theft , and the issues we had with ours , the resort has its good and bad points just like other similar resorts grounds , beach , and pools are well kept , restaurants are quite nice , rooms are accommodatiing , and many staff really do make an effort to provide good service there is an abundent food choice , and the food is reasonably good in most restaurants on the downside , this resort is huge , and with about 6000 guests on site at any given time , lineups and crowding are typical situations getting a shady spot at pools or at the beach can be challenging because people reserve them early we actually witnessed a few heated confrontations over shady spots all in all , the sheer size of this resort is , in our opinion , its weakest point we liken it to what we call mass produced vacationism if you do not mind the crowds , lineups , and lack of quiet/privacy , and just nice weather and sun is your thing , go for it that said , if you are looking for a safe and relaxing vacation , with a more personal and intimate environment , this kind of resort is not for you 
beautiful but disappointing overall just spent a week there and i am coming back thinking that one week was definitely enough let 's start with was is great with the bahia principe this is a big resort with nearly 2000 rooms in total and spread over a very large area ( which for some is not a positive ) with beautiful gardens , architecture , bars ( particular the one in the ambar section ) , pools and beach and probably 20 restaurants in total ( i did not actually count them but for sure there is a lot of restaurants ) it is worth noting that the resort is actually multiple resorts book at the ambar if you are going there as a couple as it is for adults only and it offers slightly more upscale buffet now with the less than positive : the food is really not outstanding while there is grat diversity with the restaurants , in reality there is little since most of the food taste the same actually , the a - la - carte restaurants are just not good for most secondly , the service in the restaurants and at the hotel in general is pretty bad finally , there is little do to outside of the resort ( which is true for all of th resorts in punta cana and not something related to this resort ) finally , the rooms are very humid i suspect this is due to the limited exchange of air in the rooms but the rooms ( actually , the bed ) smell rotten as a result this is rather unpleasant if you go there during the warmer months were air - conditioning is used more heavily , this problem is less likely to be as bad as it was for us also , try select an upper - floor room which is inherently be dryer therefore , if you like good food in your vacation , avoid this hotel if you like to relax , spent time at the bars or you are with kids or do not care about food or service , this is a good option as for us , we will definitely not go back 
wish i was back we were at the resort from 2/9/08 - 2/16/08 there were four adults and one child first of all punta cana is a beautiful place very plush and green with flowers every where the resort was clean and the rooms and grounds were wonderful the food was ok we did get tired of the buffet food and would have preferred more choices for places to eat for the most part the people working at the resort were friendly and helpful we ran into a couple that were rude but that as the minority as the resort is so large it took us a couple of days to figure it all out we stayed in #5 which was a great location - short walk to large pool , beach , el pescador restaurant , and shuttle bus it was a little confusing at first because the shuttle bus that brought us to our room with our luggage was not the shuttle we used during the rest of the week that shuttle you pick up by the tropicana theatre on the other side of the lobby once we figured that out it was easy and the shuttles ran continiously a couple of other tips , bring lots of $1 00 bills for tips for maids , bartenders , etc also we learned the el pescador and el charro restaurants serve a buffet breakfast and lunch - they are located right in front of large pool/beach it turned out to be much easier to not always have to go the buffets by lobby also the snack areas by large pools is also a good stop of lunch bring your own lotion as the hotel does not provide we had shampoo and shower gel but no lotions we also went to the two pools in the ctr of compex for a change if you go to the large pool we found it easier to go to the right when you came to pool - that end is a little quieter , has a shallow end for little kids , plus a swim up bar and they also serve you drinks at you chairs there the exit to the beach is also right there we would take our beach towels and save chairs on the way to breakfast and then have good places ( in the shade ) for as much of the day as we wanted the rum is very good sorry we did not buy some to bring home thought we would pick it up at airport but it turned out to be $5 00 higher then hotel all in all we had a great week the weather was perfect every day they do have showers (3 nights ) for maybe an hour or so but every day was sunny and warm 
amazing beach we stayed at the bahia principe bavaro from feb to be honest , we were quite concerned about the negative reviews we read on tripadivsor and almost changed our destination we 're glad we did not the resort is absolutely beautiful perfectly manicured grounds , impeccably clean , large rooms with private balcony , fabulous pools but its best feature is , by far , the gorgeous , wide beach with white sand and plenty of lounge chairs and palapas upon arrival , we were upgraded to the diamond club ( villa 26) we were located relatively close to the beach , were entitled to four ? la carte dinners for the week and had maid service twice a day all good perks in general , we thought the food was very good we enjoyed all four dinners at the restaurants our favourites were the french and mediterrean the quality , presentation and service were delightful the buffet was terrific food was abundant , there were numerous choices ( including a low fat menu ) although i must agree that the food and coffee were not always piping hot in our opinion , the wine was not very good but we were able to purchase respectable wines ( i robert mondavi ) at a reasonable price other than the maids , the staff really make an effort to please the guests they are friendly , courteous and efficient at the diamond club ( not sure if it is available in all rooms ) there is an express line where one can call with any request not only do they provide the service quickly , they also follow up with a phone call to make sure the guest 's needs were met of course when compared to five star hotels in north america , it may appear as if the bahia principe falls a little short but please bear in mind that the dominican republic is a developing country , yet in tourism it strives to be first rate it provides one of the most exquisite beaches , warm weather and sunny skies make the best of it once the vacation is over , you may be back to frigid temperatures , like we are here in montreal 
the hotel was overbooked and they moved us to another hotel for one night which cut a large chunk of fun out of our 3 day vacation we tried to talk to them about this but they really didnt seem to care as mentioned by previous reviews , the management at this hotel is completely indifferent to whether their guests are being taken care of when we came back , they upgraded us to the ambar section , and i 'm not sure what that really got us , since it seemed that there was really nothing to prevent you from eating , drinking , or swimming wherever you wanted food was decent , breakfast was the best i thought the hotel was very clean its definitely a large resort , but you can walk easily from one end to the other in about 5 minutes the only need for the shuttle is if you are elderly , have kids , or need to get your suitcase to a lobby in another part of the resort 
my wife and i read all the reviews and talked to alot of people who had visited this resort before booking , needless to say we were very satisfied the grounds were well maintained , the staff for the most part were excellent ( more on that in a moment ) the food was better than anticipated and our room was great the only snag to the whole thing was when we booked in juan was the fellow who booked us in and explained most of what we needed to know , but also mislead us by this i mean we were told we could go anywhere in the resort except for the ambar area which we said okay we were ataying in one of the hacienda villas but did not have the correct bracelet , which we were told we could obtain for an extra 210 dollars other than this everything was great in every resort you take the good and the bad , this resort is a 5 star , perhaps on the low end of the 5 star but still a 5 star oh yeah , the beach is amazing 
terrible experience i would like to shear with all readers the terrible experience we went through in this resort we arrived to the gran bahia principe ambar section at approximately 1 30 am on february 07/08 unfortunately , we were not too impressed with the initial greeting that we received at this resort we were told to go to the biding ? 64 on the second floor and look for room 64206 and 64204 ( we were two couples and traveled together ) to our big surprise only two doors on the floor had the number tug in order to found the right door we had to play a guessing game : trying ??ur door card? in different doors ( at 1 we were told that ??ecause we arrived so late ? the restaurants are close and if we like to get something to eat , we will need to call and order room service we called room service , ordered some food for 4 persons ? and after waiting 2,5 hours the food finally arrived the order was mixed up we received not the food we ordered but for 4 persons we received only one fork and one knife was late and we went to sleep in the morning we started to unpack the luggage - another surprise : the safe was loose and not attached to the wall i called to the express service : the answer was ??ait in five minutes the person will be to fix this problem? this repair took to resolve all day long when i complained to the customer service they told ? you did not had to wait in the room? next day after our day on the beach my wife told me that her make - up is missing after double checking all our belongings , we went to the customer service desk and informed the clerk victor about this incident victor told as not to worry and he will get back to us next morning next morning and during all day ? nobody contacted us my wife went again to the customer service desk , this time she spoke to erika erika specked to victor and told to my wife that by next morning action will be taken and reported back to her the next day is over ? no further responses my wife was pretty really upset , went to the customer service and requested to speak to the manager of the customer service the lady that called herself manager , told my wife that we need to fill - out a special report , go to the room with security guards ? then she will resolve the problem we did all what she requested and next day she approached us in the lobby and told as that the investigation did not bring any results : they searched the locker of the cleaning lady and could not found any - thing ( after 3 days ) she advised to proceed with our travel insurance by this our poor experience was not over : next day tv stopped working ? took two day to fix it one day after , when we wanted to get in to the room ? the card did not open the door ? we forced to walk to the lobby , wait in line for 45 min ( there was a line of not happy gests completely upset ? i went to the manager of the customer service and told about all what happened ? she promised to contact us in the morning ( before our departure ) ? i am disappointed with the customers are treated in a five star hotel and strongly would advise to stay away from bahia principe ambar 
could work for you , depends on your expectation and perspective was going to write a whole long review here but read b0neman_66 review , it 's spot on and i agree on his points ( right down to the comment on chasing down maids to get towels i laughed reading this b/c it just happened to me and my g/f 3 days ago this is not a 4 or 5, so please do not put much weight into those reviews it 's a huge all - inclusive that caters to the masses service and food are below average if you 're on a budget and actually like the whole all - inclusive thing , you might be fine with this place otherwise , rethink it and shop around personally , looking back i 'd rather have spent some extra $$ and gone to aruba , but we did get a nice beach , pools and sunshine out of the deal so i ca not complain too much 
mixed feelings about bahia just returned from two weeks at bahia principe bavaro jan 27- feb 10i read several reviews from tripadvisor prior to booking we stayed in the diamond club section of the resort , our room was located adjacent to the construction currently on site and we asked to be moved we lived from our suitcases until our room was relocated 2 days later we were welcomed into our new room with towel art , t - shirts , a bottle of rum and were very pleased it was spacious and very clean during the first few days we had encountered a bit of rain in the evening and after unpacking in our new room i left a pair of ( expensive ) white capri pants hanging in the bathroom to dry - adhering to the hotel policy of not placing any items on the railing outside the capris disappeared the next day i can only assume that the cleaning staff picked them up with the towels by mistake even though i placed all the dirty items in the tub i reported this to the diamond club staff immediately but they did not seem alarmed by this occurrance and the pants were never located i left a tip and asked for extra pillows - the tip disappeared but it was only when i saw a maid a few days later and asked again that i finally recieved a pillow there were several different maids , no planned time that the room was cleaned and we were awoken early a few days , a maid knocking on the door , other days the room would not be cleaned until late in the afternoon late one night we were in bed when the maid knocked on our door delivering the beach towels i accepted each day that something was missing - no face cloths for a few days , then minus a few bath towels , a bath robe , gel , shampoo two nights out of 14, we got the clean beach towels delivered to our room and turn down service with chocolates on the good days i would leave a tip but that did not seem to encourage the service it was a hit and miss most days i would also recommend that you pay for the room safe as there were a few days that we arrived back to our room in the afteroon and the door was wide open as the maid was taking care of several rooms at once the grounds are beautifully kept and immaculate the food at the buffet had lots of selection but it was lukewarm , and the meat was often undercooked the buffet is extremely busy but i felt rushed and often ignored - very poor service we made use of the a la carte restaurants , found them to be run well and the waiters very friendly overall , from previous reviews i thought tipping would get you some extras but that is not necessarily the case i suppose my expectations were a little high good and bad at this hotel , a little daunting with the size but after a few days you can find your way around without a problem i would recommend that you upgrade to the diamond or gold club , i would not want to risk the service being a 'regular ' also , learning some basic spanish would be helpful as there is little to no english spoken by the staff i would still recommend this resort to others but beware of what service you will actually recieve and lower your expectations 
gran bahia principe punta cana - excellent we just returned from a great vacation at the gran bahia principe , punta cana ( feb 3 - 9) a group of 8 of us and we had a wonderful time weather was wonderful - mid 80's daytime , and mid to high 70's at night the beach is awesome the best sand i have ever seen lots of chairs at the beach and the pool we never had a problem gathering enough chairs for our entire group and we did not reserve them in the early a like some travelers do if you are intersted in the catamaran , wind surfing , etc make your reservations early you ca not just go to the beach shack and ask to take out a catamaran as they are reserved ahead of time restaurants - the ala carte 's are excellent make your reservations right away at guest services we had the japanese - our groups favorite , italian ( veal was excellent , so was the lobster ) , french gourmet ( filet mignon and the lobster again very good ) , garden grill steak house - was fine recommend the tenderloin as it had good flavor and was thicker , other steaks were pretty thin loved the desserts at the restaurants do not be afraid to try more than one guest services - they will help you with anything they can we worked with jean and he did an excellent job he was always making sure we had what we needed and that we were having a wonderful vacation tropicana theatre - we only went to one show michael jackson - the group thought it was ok we did not go to any of the other shows , although each night the seating was fullpueble principe - great square of shopping and entertainment the karaoke bar was fun it did depend on the crowd though as many languages of songs obviously it was better when people were singing in your own language great bartenders - gave their own rendition of tom cruise in cocktail the house band on the center stage was very good as well we enjoyed just listening to them there is a group of workers who perform and get audience members to dance it was fun bars - all were good we hung out in the lobby bar piano player during the evening , and waitresses fun and relaxing the swim up bar was always nice try the drink of the day do not count on wait staff at the pool beach bar - nice as well take a walk down the beach to the market lots of vendors selling their items we were told pay between 30 - 50% of what their first price is lots of paintings fitness center - we used it everyday it does not open until 8:00 so it is really busy at 8:00 a if you can wait until 9:00 or after it is not as busy the equipment is old and worn , but you can make it work there are 3 treadmills , 1 elliptical , 6 bikes , 2 row machines , and then a weight machines , benches , and free weights we made it work , but it was not state of the art by any means could use some updating snack bar - this is a buffet service near the pool we were hoping for a made to order type place mainly burgers , chicken , fries , make your own deli sandwich , fruit it was fine , but by the end of the week we got tired of the same thing the buffet in the main lobby is fine if you stick to the made to order stuff ( omelets in the a and chicken , burgers at lunch ) you were guaranteed it would be hot lots of great fruit buffets near the beach for lunch were only ok take the trip to the main lobby buffet for better food and service rooms are nice and big we asked for extra water and had no problems getting more room safe is $32 for the week bring a travel alarm clock , no clock in the room no extra plug in either if you are looking for a room with an ocean view , i am not sure that the gran bahia can meet those requests all the rooms are further back from the beach i do not think you could see the beach from any of the buildings only upgrade for the room services , restaurants , private pool we did not upgrade at all not sure we would next time or not maybe to the new amber area for adults only excursions - we did two excursions through vip - onsite in the tour operator office bavaro runner - excellent loved all the stops and mimi and orlando our guides did a great job mimi is extremely knowledgeable and very funny we had a great day with them i would recommend it as we learned so much about the area and the culture bring stuff to give the children along the way i brought over 40 pencils and gave all of them out 
great hotel - a few downsides ok this may seem a bit conflicted , but i will do my best to keep it simple my trip was from feb 4 - 9, 2008 my party consisted of 14 women between the ages of 35 and 65 it was a trip away from husbands , work and responsibility our primary goal was to party and relax in that order first of all , a smaller group of us had been to another resort in pc the year before and had a blast the caribe club princess so , we were basing a lot of our opinions comparitively the gran bahia is far superior with regard to amenities , food and drink quality it is also huge we booked through apple , in my opinion , the only way to go we seemed to get upgraded , though i do not know how we were in villas 21 and 22 which are closest to the pool and beach that was great because if we were further back , it would be a hike to either the rooms are clean , spacious and very nice though we had requested all doubles and most of us ended up with kings no big deal as we were told we had been upgraded and that was part of the deal rooms on the first floor did have water bug or roaches none for me on the second floor the italian restaurant - the one you make a reservation for - was some of the best food i have ever had in my life we should have booked it twice and skipped the brazilian huge , insanely clean pools the beach is very crowded and the guy yapping on the loud speaker was driving us insane however , watching the russian contingent 's volley ball match was worth it the lobby is gorgeous , but we would have preferred the dj that ththe caribe club had instead of the guy on the casio uh , that was lame also , for an all - inclusive , the bars close very early the karoake was a lot of fun , but is not open on mondays and only opens at 10 and goes to 1:00 also , it is more like a giant sing along instead of karaoke as the words are flashed on a huge screen and the entire bar sings louder than the one with the mic there is a whole network of shops that is convenient the lobby gift shop is grossly overpriced just walk around the corner to the shopping center and get the stuff at half the price the bottom line is that we loved the rooms , the food and cleanliness however , for a group looking to party , i would not recommend this hotel i plan on taking my husband and two teenagers to this resort next year , but for the girl 's trip , we just need a little bit more action 
beautiful vacation just got bach , was there from jan 31 2008, to the 7th of feb punta cana airportas soon as you get your bag , you are surrounded by people who want to take your bag to your bus , for the $2 i gave , well worth it , they know where the buses are , and i just followed hotelthe goodbeautiful , clean , well kept the badalittle confusing getting around the first couple of days , every night would have someone asking how to get where , alot of people get lost the first couple of days roomsthe goodbeautiful , clean , and large the badyou need 2 or 3 of there pillows to make 1 just ask your housekeeper and they will give them to you , we had 2 each to begin also you can here everything outside your room foodthe goodgood choice of food , we enjoyed the restaurants buy the beach for lunch and breakfast , the badreservations at the a la cartes are hard to come buybeach , the goodbeautiful beach , beautiful ocean , just beautiful no problems for chairs , no problems poolthe goodmain pool is huge and right buy the beach , we had access to diamond pools , enjoyed them late afternoon , less people the badpeople who think this is there private pool , sit there being loud , drinking booze for hours , and not getting out of the pool to go to the bathroom , discustingstaffthe goodstaff were great  friendly , they really do not like to say no to anything and try hard to help , love the staff at this hotel the badnot many speak english , but the reception gives you a bahia passport , and is has english to spanish translations of words you may need ( like housekeeper , water , towels etc ) if you keep this book and use it it is helpfull even has a mini map inside we always found a way to communicate what we needed and if we were missing anything we would just call reception and they would send what we needed ( if mini fridge was not filled , or any towels missing etc ) overall we loved this resort , it is a little big and takes some time getting used to it but it is beautiful and staff are great keep your small issues small and you will enjoy , our rule was not to let anything ruin our trip , and keep positive , and we had a great timeplease feel free to pm me if you have any questions , and if you are going to this resort have fun and realize how lucky we are to be able to go , there are alot of people that will never have a trip like this in ther lives try the spanish coffee or irish coffee and a mama wana in the evening , your significat other will be happy , lol 
a few problems , but it is what you make it we were a group of six , two couples and two single ladies sharing a room , flew sunwing out of winnipeg jan 26 arrived around 5pm , off to building 28, only to arrive and the ladies have a king bed they say there are no rooms available with two beds , and after two days upgrade the whole group to ambar to accomodate the need for a room with two beds we did not know it at the time , but it was the best thing that could have happened the bavaro side is sooooo busy , restaraunts , beach , pools , everyone is on top of each other , pushing in front at the omlette station etc the ambar section is much quieter , and you can always go hang out where the action is if you like some of our group had pringles and small bottles of liquor supplied in their room daily , others recieved them after leaving a note , no towel art on the ambar side quite a few problems with key cards not working went to the casino , you do have to pay for drinks there michael jackson show is good , but packed in like sardines 
chronic overbookers we came from toronto canada , once we got on the bus we were given a letter stating that they were overbooked and that we would be taken to the gb romano i could go on but so many things went wrong i am still in disbelief definately my last time doing a bahia last year had an amazing trip to the one in rio san juan , but this one was was horrible 
very relaxing vacation just returned from a week at this resort ? we stayed here before in january 2005 in building 2 which is right on the beach and had a wonderful vacation this year when we booked we asked for an upper room close to the beach and got a ground floor in bavaro primier which is about as far from the beach as possible i was a bit disappointed but i?? not one to make a big fuss over things as it turned out , the primier area is very nice it is like a mini resort it has it?? own pool , large and very quiet with swim up bar , it?? own buffet restaurant and snack bar , 2 of the a la carte restaurants and it?? own small lobby since we went on this vacation to rest , we actually enjoyed the area very much it was just a 5 minute tram ride to the beach the weather was cloudy and rainy for the first few days so we just sat around the pool and relaxed when we finally got to the beach , we found it very overcrowded down by the water there were always enough lounge chairs on the beach but we liked to stay back under a palapa and the beautiful palm trees my husband enjoyed the volleyball which seemed to go on continuously all day the only place i ever felt crowded was on the beach next to the water and at the beach snack bar i found absolutely no problem with the service although we only ever tipped our maid and the waiters in the a la cartes we found that everyone bent over backwards to serve us no matter if at the bar or buffet or even the tram drivers and all tried to use a little english you must remember that there are a lot of europeans staying there so it is not just english these waiters have to learn but german , french , italian , russian etc we went to 3 restaurants and had no trouble booking for 7 pm we first went to the dominican restaurant it is actually an open air snack bar through the day just around the corner from our room the food was amazing i had a white fish cooked in coconut milk that just melted in my mouth i should have asked for another serving the mediteranian was also good it was more ??ourmet? and the food was again excellent my husband had ??he best steak he has ever eaten? my chicken was amazing as well our third choice was the japanese i was slightly disappointed in it at the japanese restaurant we went to last year in mexico , the cook put on a wonderful show and we were even offered saki to drink not so here the cook just stood there and cooked ? very little ??how? the vegetables were over cooked and everything had way too much salt on it but the sushi and soup were very good the bed was hard but we liked it that way we got both thin and plump pillows so we had a choice the rooms were cleaned to my satisfaction and the sheets were changed twice through the week one day the maid forgot to leave towels and another day she forgot to leave water a quick call to our lobby got both items in under 10 minutes we got a few bites i?? pretty sure these bugs are called ??o see - ums? you don?? see them but you sure feel them but i only got about 4 bites one year in the bahamas my legs were absolutely covered with bites so this wasn?? really bad in comparison any other problems we had were airport related and these bothered us far more than any little problems at the resort if you like a small intimate resort , do not go to bahia principe this might not be a 5 star if you are comparing it to hawaii but it is 's one of the best in d we have travelled extensively in the carabean and from our experience we always say if you could take a 5 star resort from mexico and put it on the beach in punta cana you would probably have a close to perfect resort 
well we just got home well we just got home from a 1 week stay we traveled with a group of 10 friends i found this resort way to big , we have traveled some where differerent each year for the past 6/7 years the resort was very well looked after , very nice rooms , grounds were nice , beach was awesome , lots of bars where you got good service food was probably the worst food of any resort we have been to other than the japeneseand the paris which were awesome food our friends were spread out through the different 4 resorts in this complex , our fault probably as we should have e - mailed and requested rooms close together , seem to have spent alot of time trying to meet somewhere shows were good , overall it was a very good trip first holiday we have been on with our close friends although i iwould not return to this resort because of the food and size we prefer to go somewhere different each time we travel the world is big we went on a tour of the countryside it was very good for us we got to see how the dominican people live started out bought candy to give to the kids ( fun at first then i felt disgusted that we were letting very young children run for a km to dig candy out of the bush as we just throw it from the truck , stop and the kids swam the truck to get candy ) well time to go hope this helps oh and watch the people at the buffet it can get pretty rough in the stampede for food ( busy ) please contact me for more info if you wish 
loved it stayed at this resort jan 17-24, 2008 upon arrival at the punta cana airport , get ready for people asking you for tips the welcome band was kicking a bucket around for tips and a maid was in the bathroom looking for tips , etc there were various buses waiting to transport us to the resort do not get confused there are tour operator desks on your right hand side just go up to them and look for your specific tour company ours was sunquest and they will inform you which numbered bus to get on to take you to your resort the drive to the resort was about 20 minutes the bahia principe is absolutely beautiful and the grounds are well kept and amazing there are 2 identical sides to the hotel the punta cana side and the bavaro side the resort seems huge when you first arrive , but after a day , you know your way around the are trolly cars that take you from one end of the resort to the other continually from 6:00 am -3:00 am there are little bus stops everywhere , and you do not have to wait long at all we stayed on the bavaro side of the resort we paid the extra money to be a part of the diamond club glad we did private check in and check out our room was close to the semi - private pool and the italian a la carte restaurant where we enjoyed breakfast and lunch must ask for the bathrobes and slippers though i am a fussy eater and the food was amazing there were so many choices at the buffet and we enjoyed the french ( filet mignon and lobster was the best we ever tasted ) , bbq and steakhouse a la cartes we did not like the mexican restaurant just was not enough dishes to choose from ( i did not like any - but i am a fussy eater ) the service was impeccable your wine glass never went empty and the coffee is nice and strong as soon as you were done with your plate , it was whisked away the staff are pleasant and friendly most spoke english and french as well the mini - fridge in our room was not stocked with water and we were advised not to drink the water so we communicated with our cleaning lady and water was restocked everyday unfortunately , they only have the big 1 litre bottles of water , not regular bottles so buy some small bottles if you are traveling on any excursions bring your own facecloths too people were complaining about not being provided facecloths in their rooms , but we were prepared as we read the reviews on tripadvisor before leaving there is a store just off the lobby very expensive , chocolate bars and chips , $3 so make sure to stock up on snacks before you arrive at the resort the lobby bar was fantastic , they mixed good drinks the pools , snack bars and beach bars were great we brought travel mugs , better than the little plastic cups that they give you the beach was extremely clean , there were always loungers available , no matter what time of day you went white sand and warm turquoise water it was lovely there is a shipwreck off shore in front of the beach , very cool the beach was usually windy parasailing is offered for $65 00 each or $85 we doubled and it was a blast bring your gravol though banana boating was $10 beware of no price tags in the fleamarkets you can walk to the fleamarket its 25 min walk on the beach expect to pay 50-60% of the asking price bartering is a must they wo not tell you the price , they tell you what are you willing to pay and go from there bring your calculator too as everything is in pesos the vendors are aggressive , if you are not interested , keep repeating no , gracias and walk away we took the free shuttle to the palma real mall its a 45 min ride one way and a waste of time for us it was all high end stores , extremely expensive we did the bavaro runners punta cana/ bavaro day trip we traveled in an 18 person jeep to a sugar cane plantation , a typical home , a school ( sat , it was closed ) , tobacco place , went horseback riding , had lunch and swam at a private beach do not give money to the children if you do give money , the children will not go to school as it is easier to beg bring pencils or crayons for them instead there are people trying to sell you stuff at every stop though , from coffee to cigars to taino art the drivers are crazy , there seems to be no rules of the road the tour was well worth the money at the end of each day we enjoyed relaxing in the lobby bar good drinks and a nice place to chat , read a book or play cards it closes at 11:00 pm and then we found not much to do it should stay open until midnight and then you could head out to the pueblo principe pueblo principe is just on the outskirt of the lobby there is a karaoke bar and casino , vendors and stores the house band starts playing at 11:00pm and the disco opens at 12:00pm there are also nightly shows starting at 9:45 pm kind of lame , what can you expect , not our thing 
great vacation we stayed the week of jan 19 to jan 26/08 the resort is huge but yet easy enough to get around with the trams we never had to wait more than 2 mins for a tram either the beach was incredible the white sand and warm water is everything we had hoped for we were always able to find chairs at both the beach and pool side no matter what time of day we showed up the buffet was more than plentiful a lot of selection even for picky eaters each night there was a theme for the food being served whether it be italian , mexican , dominican , carribean , etc the ala cartes were absolutely amazing we dined tat he garden grill where we had rib eye steaks the steaks were soooo good that my husband asked for seconds we also went le gourmet , the french restaurant and had filet mignon the steak melted in your mouth and the mashed potatoes are the best we 've ever had our 3rd ala carte was at the japanese restaurant maiko this too was incredible i recommend everything on the menu each night there is entertainment in the theater which is close to lobby we highly recommend the michael jackson show even though all the other shows were good too i only have a couple of complaints about the resort the first being the guest services whenever we contacted them with a request it took 2 to 3 days and several phone calls before we actually received what we needed we found it was just easier to ask the maid and we would receive it the next day the pillows are awfully thin , so do not be afraid to ask the maid for more and my last complaint is in regards to some of the wait staff although they were eager to please , sometimes it was difficult to communicate with them in a few instances my waiter would have to get another waiter to come and translate my request now i realize we were in a country where english is not normally spoken but i believe the staff that have direct contact with the guests should have basic english as we did our best to communicate in spanish overall we had an excellent vacation and would highly recommend this resort and most certainly return again in the future 
over rated hotel we just arrived back in canada this morning air trasat was the caarrier there is such a lack of communication with the tour operater there our plane was late and there was no one at the airport to adise us the hotel is very clean , the building are set in a very lush setting with many plants e and flowers the beach and pool chairs are always covered with towels with no one setting in them the beach has white sand but very over crowded the food is satisfing but definately not 5 star rooms are cleaned , but need new pillows , facecloths , and a major cleanthe transat tour person made it very clear when we had our arrival talk to make sure we tip and tip welli thought that we were all inclusive , meaning no tipping unless super service the hotel was over booked and most customer service people were always at you to go to a new location i am glad we went to see the place , but with the 2000 rooms there and on a very narrow property it was just too busy , not space to breath 
great beach my wife and i were among a group of fifteen who stayed at this resort from jan we had requested a ground floor room close to the beach because i have mobility problems but were placed in section #39 that was about as far from the beach as you can be after many trips to the front desk we were able to get a ground floor room in building nine ( which was about half way to the beach ) a couple of days later they seemed to be overbooked and had trouble making a change to accomodate my disability we settled in finally and enjoyed the beach and pools for the rest of the week the main buffet was just fine and we found the specialty dining to be even better the staff in both were very helpful , friendly and eager to please the beer was cold and the daily special drinks were a refreshing change from day to day the room was adequate although the king size bed was a bit too hard for my liking and the pillows were the worst i have ever had to try to get used to they were very thin and two each just did not do it for us the maid service was fine but a little inconsistant although we did leave a tip for them every day one day we got all the fancy swans , etc and the next they must have been in a hurry as we got none of the little extras or even clean towels we never did see any washcloths the whole week but just assumed that maybe no - one in the dominican republic uses them so in reality we did not find very much to complain about we went there for the beach , the sun and the sea and this resort certainly did not dissapoint us we would likely try to find a resort that was not quite so big next time we have stayed at the colonial majestic in punta cana and would probably pick it again over the gran bahia principe bavaro 
good place for the value pros : great a la carte restaurants , compared to what we have seen in other comparable punta cana hotels , the best in my opinion was the french restaurant , japanese was not bad , but we felt a little rushed in there and the rice was overcooked , the italian one is not bad , but really we had heard so much about it and had to wait till our last night there to eat in it , but it was not all that , the service , for example , was so much better at the french and mediterranean restaurants the beach was really nice , as is typical for punta cana resorts since we do not really like the shows in punta cana , such as the michael jackson or other cabaret style shows due to their poor quality , we really liked the fact that this hotel had a piano player in the hotel lobby every night , who sang really well , and we just sat there relaxed , drinking mama juana , which is what they call a vitamin drink or local viagara the rooms were absolutely wonderful , but the walls are kind of thin no problem with beach chairs like in riu bambu , for example , where you had to wake up at 6 a and reserve the beach chairs by putting towels on them cons : huge property , cannot walk from one end to another without taking a ride in one of the cars , which emit a very unpleasant odor from diesel fuel i had to hold my breath in order not to enhale the toxins water bugs in the buffet and in the first floor hotel rooms i guess this is ok for a tropical island , but you kind of do not want to see it there anyway ( we 've seen them in riu bambu too ) we also saw mice running near the hotel lobby , not a pretty sight they do not know how to make drinks very well in d , so i suggest to drink cognac , wine , or something that comes straight out of the bottle with no mixing involved big inconvinience are the card keys to get into your hotel room although they give you 2, one does not work almost right away and the other on the second day , so you ca not get into your room when you need to and must wait for some one to come and let you in there was no tv remote control in one of my relative 's rooms stone and marble floors in the hotel rooms are very slippery , so be careful no protective screen on the balcony door , so you ca not keep the balcony door open while you sleep , because all the bugs are going to fly in i have never seen a caribbean hotel room with no screen all in all , it was nice , much better than riu bambu , where the food is terrible for people who have never been to the d , but have been to aruba , hawaii and other nicer islands , do not expect a 5 star hotel to be really a 5 star hotel do not forget that you are paying 3 times less to vacation there , so it is not that bad for the price 
stay at the rui instead i 've travelled to dozens of resortsgoodthe beach , clean but no servicethe groundsthe room itself , if you do not want a lock or a safe that worksfood , better in the buffetsbadservice is horrific - might as well be one of 4000 other guests , thats right you are staying in the ambar does not mean adults only upgrading early means you paid for something others got for free , half of our guests got upgrades for nothing but only the room , no services that go with the hotel different pick up spots , be sure to check where you depart from cockroaches - check your bed at night weddings routinely start 2 5 hours late so if your wedding is at 4 it will start at 6ish so go ahead and get married by the wedding planner and sign the book for legalities whenever the jp shows up usually 2 hours late ( hope it 's legal ) if you do not do this you miss your beach pictures having spoken to 6 brides , he was at least 2 hours late for each ceremony tips do not get you anything so do not bother - save yourself a couple hundred dollars seriouslystaff is not friendly , in fact they look at the table before you leave to see if you 've left a tipno hot watershowers do not workcautionmarble is slippery when wet , especially if your ceiling caves in ground floor patio doors do not locknight security trying to sell you drugs off your patio at nightthey will charge you 10 dollars a kilo (2 2 pounds ) for your luggage overwheight group of 30 paid about 3000 us at the airport pack light , humidity adds about 20 pounds just eat at a different buffet and wear the same clothes twice 
just " ok " - nothing to write home about we were at the bahia principe from jan 3rd to 10th did not start off on the right foot with a 9 hour delay out of montreal on our way down there did not matter too much since the first day it rained in sheets the entire day - it allowed us to sleep in - so that was not too bad we met up with our friends , 3 other families who were there during the chritmas/new years celebrations - they raved about the fireworks this is not our first time in the dominican - the first time we stayed at the paradisus ( much better , more of a 5 ** than this place ) however , this hotel was so overbooked that they upgraded us to the ambar - which was very nice did not have 2 rooms together the first night ( we were 3 buildings away from the teens ) and we had to really be persistant the next day to get adjoining rooms for our son and his friend - we only tipped the man at the desk after he arranged the rooms for us - he was lovely like everyone else said - this place is so big - if you do not mind taking the little shuttle bus or walking - it 's not bad we probably would not go back because we found it just too big for our taste most nights we opted not to go and see the shows if we were at the other end of the hotel - just not worth the hassle of getting there although , the michael jackson show was entertaining ( that 's the only one we made the effort to see ) food : the ambar buffet was the best restaurant we ate at - too bad it was our last night all the others were just mediocre to lousy but food is such a subjective thing - you may find that you like it house wines were not good at all we were able to order an ok bottle of french wine at the ambar on our last night air conditioning : worked wellcleanliness : our room and bathroom was clean and spacious bed was comfortable beach : the real reason to go to punta cana is for the beach it is really long with soft white sand if you like to walk along the beach it 's great - you can go on for miles there are palm trees on the beach and little palapas too so if you 'd like to have shade , you can find it after the first day when it rained the water cleared up and did not have any seaweed or algae it was refreshing and warm did not have many problems finding chairs - however one of the members of our group would go down in the early am to set aside chairs for us weather : the weather was rather pleasant - there was always a breeze - i think it must 've been in the high 70's f to low 80's ( somewhere in the mid to high 20's c ) our first trip was in march and there is quite a difference in weather from jan to march the only unpleasant incident we had was when i tried to get 2 beach towels from the ambar towel attendant at the pool our maid had mistakenly taken our beach towels to be dirty and did not/could not replace them in order for me to get 2 clean towels i would have had to put in a complaint with guest sevices against our maid ( which i would never have done , she was wonderful ) , go back to our room , and wait for 2 clean towels to be delivered long story short ( i decided to erase all the unnecessary details ) even after speaking with the manager by phone there was no way i was going to get those towels a nice gentleman with a walkie - talkie who i assume was either a manager or superintendant asked me to wait a moment - he somehow retrieved 2 dirtly towels for me which allowed me to exchange them for 2 clean towels gheesh , one would expect to have better customer service when tourism is the biggest industry in the country - well , anyway the only reason we went here was because we were joining friends - i probably would not choose to go back here if it were just our immediate family 
ok we arrived at our room to find out the 2 keys not working bellboy got maid to let us in , told us to go to lobby to asked for a room with double beds for our 22 and 18 yr old daughters they got 1 bed went to lobby to get new keys , only one worked , they did tell me to come back and they would find a room with double beds which they did back to room to find a leak in bathroom ceiling rm 25101 went back to lobby , said they would fix ,2 days later it stopped have stayed at many resorts , the food was always good , food here is just ok has 5000 people staying here people on top of each other at pool by ocean and on the beach top it all off my wife had gold chain and cross stolen from make up case i read the reviews before we booked and did not believe the negative ones saying these people must be wrong after staying here i am not so sure , buyer beware 
just ok we stayed at this resort for 6 nights in january and i would rate it a 3 i am actually the biggest fan of tripadvisor , so i read most of the reviews before our trip and i wanted to address a few issues good parts : like everyone else said , the beach is absolutely beautiful the sand is very soft : no rocks , no sea grass , etc my husband and i went to the beach every day at 8 am to reserve the beach chairs we wanted but at the end we did not think it was absolutely necessary - there were plenty of empty chairs even at 10-11 am grounds are amazing - there are flowers everywhere , everything is very clean , and the rooms are nice note : rooms are not cleaned on a regular schedule we were woken up at 7 am on our first day by the cleaning staff however , the room was not cleaned until 3 pm the following day activities - very easy to reserve , but see my note below on service we did catamaran twice , parasailing , kayaking , snorkeling , etc no problem with reservations , just make sure you reserve your activities one day ahead catamaran was awesome , although you have to pay $25 for a lesson , and parasailing was amazing as well overall , we enjoyed our trip very much however , i would not recommend this resort to anyone and i would not go back bad parts : service was absolutely terrible the language barrier is definitely a problem , and i really thought that the staff had these negative feelings towards guests staying at the resort our first bad experience was during check - in : we arrived at 2:30 pm and had to talk to the front desk for 45 minutes to get our room assignments ) no champagne , no wet towels , no i am sorry about the wait bartenders are not friendly , waiters at restaurants did not care about good service , etc we left many tips , but mostly for people who actually did a good job as opposed to just people who expected tips we also were upset that the resort is not all - inclusive , as advertised there is no room service , and it is very hard to get reservations for restaurants we ended up eating at the main buffet 3 days in a row , followed by 3 days of restaurants even little things like bathrobes were not incuded bars closed at 11 pm finally , the worst part is the food we reserved our restaurants the day we arrived and we were very disappointed the food was terrible seafood is simply an extension of the main buffet , and brazilian bbq is also a buffet french restaurant served undercooked food and the most disgusting wine i 've ever tasted i really did not think the food would be a problem , since no one in my family is a picky eater , but please do not think that people who complain about food are just unhappy people - the food is really terrible other minor notes : entertainment was very bad - poorly organized and immature no activities for kids - the two girls in the mini - club ( for kids ) had colds when we got there and they were not even remotely interested in playing with the kids 
great family bonding time we had a great time at grand bahia principe we left toronto on dec 27/07 and returned on jan we took our three kids , ages 25, 23 and 19 and our two son 's girl friends the resort was perfect for our group the food was very good even in the buffets , i felt the selection and quality was very good and i like good food the rooms were very nice and the grounds were beautiful the beach was great and our kids loved playing volleyball with all the other guests our kids really enjoyed the disco too if i was going back , i would stay at the ambar , which is the newest part of the resort it was not offered to us as it just opened three weeks before christmas we saw one of the rooms and it was nicer than ours and brand new also , if you stay at ambar you can eat at all the restaurants in the resort we found the staff very nice but it does help to know a little spanish the staff at the front desk are good but they do not always do what they say they will do , so you have to be patient i would not go on the country adventure trip we booked it with sunwing and we were told that it was great but we did not find it to be great and the food was not good at all and it made me sick we did go on another tour that sunwing recommended it was the tour where we went snorkeling and swimming with the sharks , it was amazing and the food was great our kids went horseback riding on the beach and they loved that tour too we have been to many all inclusive resorts and this one was one of the best we would highly recommend it i was worried about getting sick and i would have been fine if i had not eaten on the country adventure we did take malaria pills and i was glad as there were bugs at night and we did get bitten none of us had any reaction to the malaria pills if you are thinking of going to this resort , rest assured that you will have a great time 
overall , it was wonderful i just returned january 8th , 2007 from a 6 day stay the rooms were beautiful , the restaurants were outstanding and the resort was kept in immaculate shape the service could be a little slow , but as long as you keep the mindset that you are on vacation and that the workers on dominican time , then it will make it a lot less stressful we had a mixup with our room , which took quite awhile to straighten around and one of the a la carte restaurants was very slow , but overall it was great there were couples and families there , so would recommend it to all ages 
good but not a 5 my husband  i along with our family ( which included our three year old grandson ) just returned from the gran bahia principe bavaro the resort was lovely and well kept the rooms were all junior suites and very clean but the beds were very uncomfortable so getting a good nights sleep was a little difficult even so we , for the most part , enjoyed our stay very much at one point or another all of us , with the exception of one , had gastrointestinal problems for some of our group a dose of immodium took care of it but i personally suffered with it until after i got back home we were allowed to reserve four of the several a la carte restruants the brazillian was the first of our reservations stay away from it the food was not very good at all everyone at the table had something different and all found the meat very tough and over done i , a vegetarian , had nothing because everything on the menu contained meat our next night out was mexican a little better but not by much again , nothing on the menu for a vegetarian our third night was french everyone at the table enjoyed their meal but some left the table hungry  went to the main buffet dining room to fill the empty spots i , again , found nothing on the menu suitable for a vegetarian our last reservation was at the italien resturant everyone enjoyed their meal  i was able to order a veggie pizza i was finally able to eat  enjoy a meal with the family our meals at the main buffet style dinning room offered a great variety of food and there was always plenty of it but it was often cold breakfast was not to bad if you had an omlet te made up for you on the spot but everything else could have been a little warmer not a problem for me as i usually ate fruit  a bit of toast but a problem for everyone else the resort is very big , almost a village it 's self , but there were open air cars to transport people from one end of the resort to the other service at the resort was pretty good and the staff friendly try to learn at least a few phrases in spanish because you will definitley find them useful if you looking for something smaller and more intimate this is not the place for you in a week we did not see the whole resort the beaches were great and if the beach is not your thing there were several pools with swim up bars on the property would i give it 5 stars a definite 4 but not a 5 
too large for personalized service terrible food , terrible service we stayed at this resort over the christmas holidays from december 21 to december 28, 2007 ? the hotel lobby was very nice and clean - check in went very smoothly with no hitches staff was polite at check in we were given a map and that was it no schedule of activities , no information on booking reservations in restaurants the extra things that you paid for as part of your package for us , thank god we had trip advisor this hotel has several sections and not all packages are not allowed to enjoy all of the amenities you just wander into a pool area and someone comes up to you and tells you to leave i saw it happen to several guests some instructions at check in can prevent this ok - good things then property - the property is quite nice landscaping is good ( not breathtaking ) and the resort is kept very clean this is a big plus given that there are almost 70 buildings at this resort , each with about 18 rooms each we did a back of the napkin calculation and came up with about 7,000 people at this resort at full occupancy over the christmas period they kept people waiting to eat on christmas dinner night and had to send folks to the upgraded premier area just to accommodate them , a real nuisance for those who actually paid for the upgrade beach - the beach and ocean are just beautiful the ocean is beautiful and very nice to swim in - no shells , no rocks - just beautiful miles of white sand this was the biggest plus on this vacation there is plenty of shade on the beach but to get a lounge chair , you had to be out there to reserve one with your towel by 8am in the morning a real downer for vacationers the beach also allowed topless so there was a lot of that rooms - the rooms were comfortable and very clean we stayed in the ambar section as an upgrade bed was average ( no westin beds here ) but comfortable air conditioner worked great bathroom was nice and clean with rain head showers lighting was terrible in the rooms i would say the rooms and furnishings are about 3 star level now for the areas needing improvement ( lots of it ) food - at about 7,000 people , the place starts to feel like a campus instead of a resort and the food takes on a cafeteria quality the food was terrible and often cold the cooks were very sloppy in preparing your meals ( e , omelettes etc ) you could not trust the salads they always had lots of water at the bottom of the pan we found that the food at the beach was much much better and was at least warm we had roast chicken , burgers , and fries on most days those were the only hot items you have to love pork to enjoy the dr there is lots of it and not too bad either we wished they had more local food - maybe it would have been better prepared the cooks ( not chefs ) did not seem to have a clue if food is important on your vacation - rule out this resort that said , we did get sent over to the premier section for christmas dinner due to the overflow the food was ok there - so i guess if you pay the big bucks , you can get ok food - even if it is not great we did visit the reserved restaurants and found that they just had a set menu everything is pre - made and just brought out from the fridge to the table - cold plate and all none of the restaurants were great but the french - the gourmet was better than the others we tried there is no personalized service here you get the sense that the employees here are not happy ( or treated well ) and it comes through in the service no one really stretches themselves to provide good service they are polite but not necessarily pleasant here are some examples , when our family and friends tried to call us they were transferred around for 5-15 minutes before connecting them to our room while sleeping one night , we heard what sounded like running water it was our ceiling leaking from the floor above we called the front desk and after being transferred around at 4am because each person we spoke to said ??hat?? not my job? no one ever came to check out the leak the employees would easily tell you it 's not their job to get something done and point you to someone else who says the same i get the sense the employees are not really empowered here we were a black family traveling and we also found that we received discriminatory service from the staff , e , skipping us in line and taking the white folks behind us or having to call waiters to come and serve our table there were four of us and we all experienced this at different points of our stay apparently , there is some history with dark skinned black people in the dr there seemed to be less than 20 black people at this resort of about 7000 people ? anyway , we did not let that spoil our holiday but we will not go back there getting around the resort - you have to take a shuttle if you do not want to walk ( about 5-10 minute walk ) to get around the resort especially from the beach to the main dining areas the great thing is that once you get a hang of getting around the resort , it does not seem so huge anymore nightly shows and entertainment - they had the staged shows ( as all resorts do ) which were very very average and below they tried to put on french cabaret and other western shows e , lion king - of course - oddly interpreted this is like making dinner for a bunch of chefs since most of the guests there were europeans or americans they had a mini - circus one night , which was very good they would have been better off showing off the latin culture , which is very rich , vibrant and fun they also have a nightly live band that does a mix of imitating western ballads etc ? very poorly ? the singers were reading the words while performing ? 
a great stay at the gran bahia principe my husband and i booked a last minute deal to the bahia principe we had read good reviews about the place , and honestly , we were not let down we were quite amazed at how clean the place is kept there are always staff cleaning the place in the morning in general , we found the staff to be very hardworking , and willing to help out however they could the maid cleaning our room was fabulous she left little flowers for us in the room , and decorated our room with towel art we left little gifts and small tips for her everyday to thank her in terms of the food , we advise signing up for your a la carte dinners as soon as you arrive our favorite was the japanese restaurant however , the italian was also very good ( we usually ate lunch there ) we were also very pleased with our stay because , when we asked to get a room closer to the beach , we were upgraded at no extra cost to us , which allowed us to use the exclusive pool , and gave us free internet (10 minutes each ) per day that was great also , when one of the staff found out my birthday was coming up , he gave me a free bottle of rum , and a t - shirt i thought that was really quite nice in terms of the beach , it was gorgeous white sands , turquoise water , exactly what we were hoping for the hotel also put on entertainment in the evening which , although sometimes amateurish , was still delivered with zeal all in all , we would definitely recommend this hotel the only negative we would warn you about is that , if you want to buy something like an art piece , do not wait until the end of your stay , or , if possible , do not buy from the store at the hotel we had a salesperson try to rip us off which left us really mad we told our tour rep about the salesperson and he agreed that the people in that store are horrible they had even tried to rip off our tour guide at some earlier point they think , because you are leaving the next day , they can hike up the prices to unreasonable rates , and you will pay because you 're desperate in summary , this is a clean , well - rounded hotel a very nice place to stay 
a lesson in mismanagement we booked our trip directly through bahia principe , we stayed in the golden rooms and paid about $460 a night per room ,4 rooms times 5 nights all of the places charge top dollar the last two weeks of dec , not a big deal the first thing we did upon arriving was to wait in line for the reservations then they told us that we have golden rooms so that we need to go to the golden check - in , they gave me some directions that i did not completely understand but we find it then wait in line and were asked to fill out tons of paper work they already had all of our info : addresses , numbers , why was i doing this on my vacation have they ever heard of a computer just to get this out of the way , i do not need my ass kissed i am laid back , like to dance and have fun partying the check - in was a small inconvenience but this was the start of 5 days of puzzlement the rooms , pools and grounds are nice , the beach is awesome , you can walk for miles everything else especially the food is awful we had 9 family members , we were all in disbelief in how a resort could be so mismanaged the place is huge , almost 2 thousand rooms , figure 5000-7000 people staying at the resort , and who knows how many working there it is amusing how little communication there is among the employees they must have 20 different color bands on peoples wrists , luckily we are golden ( we paid $$ ) with a clear band at first we are told that we can go anywhere , then we are told we have to make dinner reservations but we cannot make them because it is too late for tonight it is only 3pm and we just checked in , sorry the deadline is 3pm i try to call from my room and to get reservations for the next night , i will not waste your time , it took 40 minutes i did not have reservations i was told to visit the golden office in the morning the golden rooms are near the beach , the golden office is about a mile away inland you have to take a tram to get there , what are they thinking i do not want to come across as a snob , but is this how a guy who just booked a $9,300 hotel visit wants to spend his morning , taking a tram to stand in line at an office to argue about reservations i send my sister , they play a shell game for an hour and finally get some dinner reservations by now we know why it is difficult to get reservations , they do not want anyone to eat in there restaurants the food at the buffet is simply awful , they have many choices of awful everything is over cooked , all of the deserts look fine , but they all taste the same , just sugar i am not some kind of food critic , just plain and simple awful food all around us are people that want coffee or tea after dinner and are told they do not offer any why ca not they have a couple of pots up at the buffet all i want is some simple dish that i can stomach speaking of the stomach , most of the 9 people in our family spent at least a day or two confined to their room with diarrhea and throwing up my digestive track was effected but maybe due to the fact that i stuck primarily to the fruit i did not have any bad symptoms they have signs posted that the water in the room is not potable i am not a doctor and do not know the reason for so many problems i have never seen this during previous stays in punta cana at other resorts my brother - in law was the worst , he spent the last two days of our bahia visit in the bathroom we flew to miami after our stay , he was treated at mt sinai medical center they put him on an anti - biotic and gave him 7 liters of fluid intravenously we all lost weight , they should advertise this place as a weight loss clinic i am sitting on my beach chair and want a diet coke i would find that the first 3 bars all would have a broken diet coke dispenser , at the forth i wait in line and someone behind the counter pours me a diet coke i want one the next day and go straight for the place that served me yesterday and they tell me they only serve beer want a diet coke after 5pm after a walk on the beach now that the sun is not so hot you will not get one at the beach bar , over to the pool bar no , remember they told me only beer you have to just laugh it off after a few days you start to feel like a rat being tested in a maze , but you figure out that if you specify exactly the rum and the mixer you have a better chance of getting a drink that you do not just throw out in the nearest trash ( if you can find a trash can ) we also found that even with the golden band there were places we could not go , but were told that the diamond and ambar band could not use some of our stuff it was really just ridicules , you have to laugh , they could not even explain all of the differences if asked i could go on for 25 more pages , i could have walked around the resort every day with a tape recorder and recorded how mismanaged this place is the real estate itself was built and maintained like a nice hotel in the states , the hotel is obviously run by someone with little or no hotel expertise this place should be studied by hotel analysis but should be avoided if you are a hotel guest 
a happy new year chose this location because we could not get flights to any other carribean location we arrived feeling a little sceptical having been spoilt by a previous stay at sandals dunns river in jamaica on arrival we were hugely surprised by the impressive beauty of the complex and the standard of cleanliness the complex is vast and has all the amenities expected in a hotel of this class , the food in the buffet restaurant was ok and the breakfasts were above average be warned book the al a carte options as soon as possible as the tables go quickly we ate at 4, the bbq ( not that good ) , the mexican ( ok ) , the steak house ( very good ) and finally the gourmet which was outstanding both in terms of the food and the service we ventured to the beach on a few occasions and we were amazed at how crowded it was , the sea was choppy but still had that lovely turquoise colour the sand was white and soft ( cleaned rigorously every day by hotel staff ) the new year celebrations were brilliant this despite a heavy rain shower which threatend to but a damper on it all (15 minutes of fantastic fire works and 3000 people all getting in the mood ) all in all this is a nice hotel , staff are friendly and the climate unbeatable no stomach upsets which was nice a brief note about dolphin island in punta cana , we could not book through our own tour operator as they has concerns about the safety we went and have to agree it was but nothing like other swims we have experienced the dolphins were nervous and seemed poorly trained , we were butted several times and our kids felt uncomfortable as did we our advice dont go we are not sure but that is not a reflection on the hotel just our own personal taste which for our sins will always be coloured by the sandals experience 
does not compare to the riu resorts let me preface this by saying this is not my first time to an all inclusive resort in the dominican or other countries so , i have experience and know what one should expect december - 27 december 2007 - booked thru funjet weather was terrific with lots of sun and temps in the 80s ( f ) with heat indexes near 90( f ) , only a couple of showers so the weather was just about perfect the resort is huge and the rooms were very , very nice ( all jr suites ) sadly , i have said everything nice i can really say about gran bahia i found out very quickly that uno momento , 1 minute , or 5 minutes basically means i ca not help you , will not help you , and will not be back first day , checked into the room with 2 adults and 1 almost teenager having been up from 2:30am to make a flight until arriving in punta cana around 4pm in the afternoon total of 2 towels in the room , no hand towels , no face towels called the front desk , called guest services and reported 5 minutes sir was the reply it took until noon the next day (4 phone calls , trip to the front desk and trip to guest services ) would be fine if this was the only time we could not get towels but it was just the first time there is a mini - bar ( actually just a in - room mini - fridge ) that is supposed to be restocked daily do not hold your breath it will not be stocked daily they tell you in the info in the room , and everywhere else for that matter , to not drink the tap water but how about restocking the bottle water daily that would be a really nice touch i found that the only way i could keep water and sodas in the room was to walk around the complex looking for a housekeeping cart that had those items visible on the cart and take them otherwise , i was continually told , uno momento and then later sorry , could not find any are you kidding me complained to guest services whose famous phrase was not a problem , we will take care of it no , it is a big problem others have mentioned that this is not a 24 hour resort this is also very disappointing we have been to other resorts where you can get food that is included in your package up until the wee hours of the am a big difference we found between this resort and what we have experienced elsewhere ( mostly riu resorts ) is that the people who work at the resort are just not friendly at other resorts , it is almost like everyone is there to entertain you and is very friendly even when you pass someone who is clipping trees , bushes , etc they would acknowledge the fact you were there very few people have a smile on their faces tipping - i understand it is they way these folks make their money they could probably make twice what they do in tips if they would just loosen up and be a bit more entertaining they just pour you a drink and look at you with the look of where is my tip if you drink rum - it is included in your all inclusive if you want something besides rum be ready to pay for it what a joke oh and there is no liquor dispensers in the room if you want a drink late at night you gotta get up and go out to get it the food was substandard even for buffet food the bacon was almost raw if you just wanted scrambled eggs they were undercooked the food had almost no variation from night to night ( something we have found different at other resorts ) about the only variation was the desserts if something was supposed to be sweet it was over sweet oh and if you want coffee with dessert as a matter of fact try finding coffee anywhere other than at breakfast pretty much does not exist but , you have a coffee maker in your room yep , just ca not get them to leave you bottle water to make coffee with you could get burgers and hotdogs out by the pool near the beach and there was a soda dispenser there also was not working the day we got there still was not the day we left the burgers were cooked unmercifully hard and the hot dogs were barely warmed , much less cooked again , have done all inclusives during the holidays for a number of years now this was by far the worst experience we have had beautiful resort and great weather too bad the little things that should make the holiday pleasant were just missing in a nutshell there is a beautiful riu resort right next door to the gran bahia you might want to consider staying there the people are friendly and they really do appreciate the fact you are staying at their resort sorry for the long post but wanted to state the facts as we found them 
language barrier resort was great when i asked for an iron though they sent me two bottle of brugal rum instead so much for ironing 
kids  travelled with sunwing to punta cana half decent food served on the plane liked it better than air canada we travelled from dec arrival was fine beware - we got charged $20 upon entry into punta cana by a customs officer we knew we were getting taken by the customs person but what can you do do not pay $20 to enter the dominican the ride to the hotel was fine a nice air - conditioned bus with seatbelts and curtains to close if you wanted to nap it was about a 30 or 40 mins ride to the gran bahia once you arrived you were greeted with a fruit punch and escorted off the bus we arrived about 3 hours prior to check - in and our room was not ready but that was ok as we and our two children ( aged 7  3) walked around the complex to see what was there it was warm  hot and the kids only wanted to go into a pool our room was ready by 3 30pm and we were promptly taken to it in the little bell - hop tram we stayed in villa 34 with two double beds i must say the double beds were extremely hard and we asked for a different room the next day we were moved to a room with a king size bed instead in villa 6 the boys slept on the couch  it all worked out fine the rooms were always clean and made up while we were at the pool/beach we were very impressed with how clean everyting was the restaurants were clean and we never noticed any smell that some people refer to my husband can smell something nasty a mile away and he never said anything about a moldy smell in the resort or rour hotel oom buffet was half decent and the a la carte restaurants were fine our favourites were the garden grill , and the two french restaurants by the lobby the entertainment at night was great the michael jackson show was quite impressive our kids were in the mini - club and were on stage for the lion king show the animation team did a great job of working with our 7  4 year old and they had great make - up  costumes for the show too as for pool chairs , my husband went out around 8:30am or 9:00am to hold our two favourite chairs and we were usually there by 10:00am to sit by the pool we never saw people running for chairs and saw empty chairs around the main pool even at 11am and 12pm we could not figure out what people were getting so upset about pool chairs there were always some around us that were empty all day long we sat at the far end of the pool where the kids pool was and we never had issues nor did we have issues with chairs on the beach we could always find one or two to sit on while the kids played in the ocean our children loved the mini club they begged us to let them go every day and we had to beg them to stay with us for some family time too the kids they met were great i would highly recommend this hotel to anybody and even my children said they would tell people to come here they especially loved going on the tram i do not think there is anything bad we could say about this hotel all staff of this hotel , including the grounds keepers , were friendly , courteous and nice a simple hola made people smile and respond positively if you can take a few spanish words with you they appreciate it very much the animation team did a great job and if you did not want to be bother a simple , no , gracias , would send them off to somebody else the staff at the front desk or guest services were always happy to make sure we were happy if we had any issues , tipping at the buffet and bars are recommended not that anybody expects to be tipped but it is always nice our bartenders by the kids pool section was always willing to get our orders right away even for $2 or $3 each day i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody and we are already looking at going back again next year 
reasonably satisfied just returned from a one - week stay our family of four takes all - inclusive vacations often ( usually twice per year ) in pv , mazatlan , cancun , mayan riviera and puerta plata and so we had a number of properties to use as comparisons we had two other join us on this trip and they were all inclusive newbies most things about this property are very good :1 the grounds are beautiful and the rooms are clean and spacious ( yes - there was a musty odor at times but we have found this to the be case in almost all tropical locations the beach is absolutely wonderful there are many palapas and palm trees to provide shade and lots of beach chairs you do have to get up early to find a palapa but it was usually possible to find a spot with some shade from palm trees if you arrive later the water is warm and rock free if you head left ( when facing the ocean ) , just past the end of the hotel property there are a few spots for snorkeling that are quite close shore we were able to see many colourful fish the food at the main buffet is quite good and there is lots of variety one of the people in our party is a fairly picky eater but was always able to find a variety of things to eat typically we have found desserts at the all - inclusives to be quite poor but this was not the case here the resort is very large there are many options for food and drink throughout the resort the main buffet is open for all meals the seafood restaurant ( close to the beach ) serves a smaller buffet for breakfast and lunch and there is also a snack bar there are many a la cartes the lobby bar is a beautiful spot and they serve pretty drinks there is a square just outside the main entrance ( this is still hotel property ) and there is an outdoor stage with a live band from 10 - midnight ( with bar service ) , a karoke bar , a casino , a disco and some shops and vendors but there were a few things we did not like about the resort the resort is very large although there are many restaurants and bars the hours of operation are quite staggered so depending on the time of day you may find yourself having to go quite a ways for a drink the pool bars close at around 5:00 and often our dinner reservations were quite late (9:00 pm ) so if we wanted to have an early drink , we would have to go all the way to the lobby this was a little inconvenient as often we just wanted to grab a drink and enjoy it in our room before heading out to dinner the lobby bar closes at 11:00 so if we wanted to sit outside and have a coffee/drink after our dinner , we would have to head out the square on the positive side the shuttle bus comes frequently so there was rarely much of a wait we were most disappointed in the quality of the food in the a la carte restaurants we had four reservations cafe de paris  le gourmet ( same menu ) , the japanese and the seafood my son and his girlfriend also tried the mexican with the exception of the filet mignon at the gourmet restaurants all of the meat was very overcooked this was especially true of the seafood restaurant having been to many all inclusives , we understand that the quality and variety of meat of other food may vary and we do not expect to have five star quality however , this was probably the worst a la carte experience that we have had this was surprising given all of the positive reviews that we had read prior to our trip also we ate breakfast in the seafood restaurant once and everything was ice cold this did not seem to be a problem during lunch so i 'm not sure if this is typical overall the experience was positive but we likely wo not return because dining in the a la cartes is something we really value and we know that you can expect better from an all - inclusive on the other hand , our two newbies loved the experience so i do not want to be too harsh in this review one last thing - i hardly saw anyone tipping at this resort which was quite sad these people work very hard - our favorite bartenders were there every single day of our seven day vacation and this included christmas eve and christmas day you will probably get the same great service whether you tip or not because it does not seem to be expected but i 'm sure it improves the quality of life for these people 
beautiful resort had lots of fun foodthe food was alright you 've got to remember that it 's buffets a buffet is never great wherever you go , even in 5 star restaurants right here in canada or the states there is a wide variety and themes every night ( italian , american , gala etc we went to the gourmet restaurant ( had filet mignon was excellent , do not order the souffl? for dessert , it 's a brownie the other desserts are excellent though ) , the italian ( was o ) and the japanese ( was good except for the desserts - cupcakes with sauce or fried ice cream - fried in same oil as main courses ) , the decor is magnificient and the service impeccable do not be afraid to eat the food even if it 's lukewarm ( as is sometimes ) you will not get sick we did not and ate everthing even the hot dogs on the beach i saw them replace food with new batches so they follow guidelines bugswelcome to paradise during our whole trip saw 5 mosquitos ( was bitten once - take your malaria tablets if your paranoid like me or have your kids take them ) , a few flies ( amazing considering all the food that is served outdoors ) since it is very humid you will see a few millepedes on walkways and in your room - if you 're on the first floor remember though you do not attain bug free paradise without lots of pesticide would not want to stay there too long the water is blue and the waves are not strong ( if you like 'em like that ) for some unknown reason there is no seaweed if you swim on the bavaro side ( where the volleyball net is ) lots of chairs and places in the shade if you 're concerned about boobs on the beach ( for your kids ) , did not see much ( ratio of 1 per 50) the interesting thing was that 9 out 10 going topless were over 50yrs old - go figure servicenever seen better service in my life everyone is polite , smiling and will get you what you need in a flash the maids and some of the people clearing dishes speak only spanish but if you ask them something they actually go get someone who speaks english entertainmentthe shows are alright they dance really well contrary to everybody else did not like the michael jackson show the best ( no one can really compare to the original ) the entertainment at the beach/pool was fun warm up exercises , dance lessons , bingo , sexy guy competitions etc it 's fun if you participate decor and cleanlinessthe resort is beautiful the decor is fabulous decor is very important to me - do not like to see anything shabby , this place did not dissapoint as for the cleanliness everything is spotless even the beach ( they clean the glasses and cigarette butts off the beach - so if you smoke please feel sorry for the guy who cleans and put your butts in the garbage before you leave ) drinksbest drinks are at the lobby bar they serve you in real glasses ( they serve plastic on the beach - for obvious reasons ) and the drinks are not watered down ( as is the case at the beach/pool - again for obvious reasons ) the wine is o no different than the house wine you 'd order over here funfun is what you make of it if you have a crappy vacation do not blame the resort i had a fabulous time and the resort did it 's part by meeting our expectations 
do not stay at this hotel do not stay at this hotel the staff is horrible and this is complete scam below is what happened to me :11/24 - booked this hotel 11/25 - money withdrawn for 2 week stay11/30 - tried to get another room , but was told that hotel is overbooked , however my room is confirmed and hotel is waiting for my arrival12/01 - provided hotel with my flight information 12/05 - received phone call that hotel is overbooked and my reservation is no longer true 12/06 - my money is returned the hotel staff pretends to be clueless about what happened my vacation is ruined , i have my flights , my whole family is traveling to this destination , however i do not have a hotel room because of gran bahia principe do not stay at this property , the hotel management is horrible 
kids will love it here second time in two years to punta canajust returned from gran bahia and was very happy with our stay but we have stayed at the paradisus in punta cana and am basing my comparison on th at resort we have an 8 and 5 year oldnow , we were extremely happy with the bahia but it is not a 5 star resort we stayed in the diamond club which offered private check in , private pool , beach towels to the room etc nice perk , but you can go with out the private pool is very very quiet , no activities , dull actually the benefit was private restaurant for b/f and lunch , quite nice the rooms are average , neat clean , well kept you have to pay for the room safe which i found odd as you are paying a good buck and they penny pinch you for $40 room safe was included at the paradisus b/f and lunch buffet in the main restaurant , simply awsome , huge selection , dont bother with the snack bar by the pool al 'carte resaturants , extremely disappointing , portions were very small and only one choice from each catagory wine by the glass only , unless you wanted to purchase a bottle dont get me wrong , the food was excellent , but this is supposed to be all inclusive french , mexican were the best for us paradisus you could order 12 of the same entree and they were happy to accomadate , and wine by the bottle to your table gran bahia , one entree , one appetizer of the nine al 'cartes at the paradisus , you had to reserve only 3, all other six plus the buffet were walk in you could eat at 6 different al 'cartes in one night gran bahia we were only allowed 4 al 'cartes thumbs way up to paradisus service at this resort was the best , kind and friendly people , better service at th bahia , by far the beach bar was great , no waiters on the beach like the paradisus , no big deal no room service , only two cans of beer in the mini fridge per day , unless you wanted to pay for extra beer that was annoying paradisus was alcohol to the room , beer , bottles of wine , whatever , all included we always ordered cheese and wine before dinner at the paradisus ( to our room ) which was awsome it was nice to get dressed up and chill with a glass of wine on the balcony at the paradisus but were disappointed that we werent offered the same at the bahiathe pool was good , shallow entry for babies and very young kids , attached 18 inch deep pool for kids to frolic in , very nice lots of action by the pool , can get a little tedious by the end of the week , but the pool bar was at the extreme other end of the pool if you look at pics of the pool , it is in three sections , the section with the swim up bar is at the east end of the pool which is closed off from the main and west end of the pool , no big deal for us , but may be for you the pool at the paradisus was huge and tropical , huge palm trees and lush paradisus pool was better for us didnt use the kids club at all , would you leave your children in a strange country with strange people i think notbeaches were both awsome , we walked down by the riu palace which was next door , seemed like dullsville bahia had music dancing etc it was awsomeshuttle service was unbelieveable , a tram every two minutesall in all it was a great vacation , but i have stayed with sol melia ( paradisus ) and they are truely a 5 star chain now if you have gone 3-4 star and then come here to the bahia , it seems like wow 5 star , its really not , its a 4, maybe a 4 +but it does lack in important areas to deem it a true 5 star for the money i will spend the extra to stay with sol melia as they make the vacation truely unbelievable i am not trying to come accross as a high roller cause i am not , but i want and need value for my money and have tried to be as objective as possiblewould i come again , yes ( for around $3000-3500 for my family of four ) , would my expectations be as high , no wayagain it is a great place , but it is not all the hypeif you have kids , go here , they will love ithope this helped and go enjoy mucho gusto 
good times we stayed in the club premier , which is a private section of this huge resort it was great because we could get away from the big crowds , it has its own pool area with daily activities and own buffet and snack resturants which means no wait times and nice and quiet you still get access to all the other main restrurants and bars and pools , but it was nice to come back to our area when we wanted a litttle more quiet time the people in the dominican are the best , so if you have never been here , you will be suprised on how happy they are tip them well , they deserve every penny entertainment at night , not really for children though so if you have children ages 1-12 with you i would skip it the food was good as it can get at another country , enjoy it not many people even get the chance to travel so why complain shopping was available on site , lots of shops we also found out the last day of our trip that you can take a water taxi from the beach in front of fhe resort to a shopping village , about $ 7 per person with return look for the boats that have banana boats , or tubes they are the ones that will take you great shoppiing deals there , and fun ride have fun and enjoy the amazing weather 
okay but not great we stayed at the bahia principe punta cana at the end of november this is a huge resort - bigger than i thought it would be , but it is beautiful the rooms are nice , the pool is huge and the beach is beautiful we upgraded to the royal golden package but i do not really think it was worth it it was nice to be closer to the beach but our room faced the outside of the resort so it seemed a bit isolated we were travelling with an 18 month old child which made the trip a bit more challenging at times my main problem with this resort was the food and i 'm not usually very picky i always found something to eat but i found the buffets really tiring , it seemed like the same thing over and over - especially for lunch since we had the royal golden package we were entitled to 4 a la carte dinners , however we only got 2 and we had to fight for that since we were travelling with a child , we wanted early meal times we got to the resort on saturday afternoon and tried to arrange meals on sunday morning they told us there was nothing left , the only spots available were at 8:30pm ( which does not work with a small child ) my husband complained to our tour operater - air transat but they did not do anything and they did not seem to care the next morning he complained to the hotel again and we got 2 a la cartes for 6:30 we met people who booked the same day and they had no issues , they got early bookings we also met people who were not golden club who had 5 a la cartes when we went for our a la cartes the restaurants were not full at all - weird anyway it was disappointing to have to fight for something we were entitled to they people who worked at the resort were very friendly for the most part and very good with my son there was definitely a language barrier though our toilet backed up 3 times and we had problems trying to get someone to deal with it overall a nice resort but i do not think it is worthy of a 5 star rating 
great service just spent a week at this resort nov this resort has truly great service overall , great rooms , beautiful grounds , excellent pools and beautiful beach the resort is large and takes a little while to find where everything is i found the food to be fairly good at the buffets , was hit and miss though the snack bars i found were not very good , poor quality and not very good selection i found the ala cartes to be fairly good , especially the gourmet restaraunt i found the premaid drinks at the bar were very sweet , almost to a sickening point the beer was fine the lobby bar made some good drinks , try the mohito 's the grounds are immaculate , the service is great , best i 've had yet , compared to riu 's or palladiums other than the food issues , drinks i could manage with , this resort is well worth trying 
spend your money elsewhere a great looking hotel with excellent beaches and amenities , complemented by rude and incompetent staff , disgusting food , cheap and lousy drinks and inadequate service we had a group of 21 people stay at this hotel upon arrival , we were greeted by hotel staff who managed to unload our luggage and leave it in the rain the front desk attendants did not have a clue as to what they were doing and managed to give everyone incorrect room assignments many members of our group were young adults who requested rooms with two beds , however , every single room we were assigned had a king size bed also , several of the people in the group were elderly , and despite the fact that our travel agent requested first - floor rooms for them , they were inconveniently assigned rooms on the third floor the resort , meanwhile , does not have elevators it took us another 3 hours of arguing to get all room assignments corrected for the group , and as a result , all of the rooms were scattered throughout the resort premises , making it difficult to stay as a group after being assigned rooms , several of our group members had to endure waiting for an hour until their maid cleaned their room this should have been done prior to the handing out of room keys as it is the customary assumption that once the room key is given to the occupant , the room should be ready for habitation other group members? had wet floors , causing one of the people to slip and fall , hitting his back , head and arm upon filing of an official report with the hotel , we did not hear from any management , and were in fact told that management was too busy to address the injury on the first night , the entire hotel was without air conditioning , making rooms feel like saunas because of the humidity and the heat the air conditioning was fixed on the second day of our stay , however , no apologies were offered to us for this horrible inconvenience eating choices were very limited at best all buffets had the same food options and i can?? qualify any of these items even as mediocre ? just plain crap badly prepared meat , no fruits , liquid ice cream , etc soft drinks are handed out by staff only , making the wait for a simple coca cola upwards of a half hour we visited three restaurants italian , japanese and french italian venue was so amazing that we decided to hit buffet afterwards japanese had a tolerable hibachi - style show with decent food the service was superior to that of any other place we visited until then the restaurant highlight was the fact that they had sake on the third try ( french ) , our group finished a bottle of vodka before they served us , so food did not taste that bad hint : the only way to enjoy food in this hotel is to get drunk beforehand ( strongly recommend to stock up in duty - free before boarding as hotel lacks anything even remotely drinkable ) i have to agree beach is excellent sand , water , weather ? the pools were nice the club was okay on the first night , however , arriving there on the second and third nights , and hearing the same exact music and cd playing got annoying very quickly since there were no other entertainment options other than the club , our group could basically recite all the words to every song by day four of our stay 
beware of parasites beware travellers i have just returned after spending the last three days and two nites in the punta cana hospital i have a parasite from the water confirmed by the punta cana hospital take your worst illness and muliply it by 10,000 i am not exaggerating although the hotel told us no one else became ill we spoke to another guest in our complex that was ill with similar symtoms at the same hospital we ate daily at the same restaurants by the beach neither of us left the complex my hospital roomate was from another resort with similar symptoms we met an emergency dr who says she has travelled the world and was in the donimican last year with a wedding party 48 of the 51 people became violently ill this is the only place in her world travels she has become sick the clinic - that is independent of the hotel provided excellent care the care at the hospital was excellent as well the tour contacts were very attentive and called numerous time to inquire how i was doing , as well as the hotel medical clinic i wil never return to the dominican 
quality resort but huge my family spent one week at the gran bahia principe in punta cana overall , this is a very nice all - inclusive resort and we were pleased with our stay there the grounds and the landscaping are immaculate the rooms , the pools , the ? la carte restaurants and the beach are definitely better than most other all - inclusive resorts we 've been to the staff was very cordial my wife and i wanted a resort with nice paths so that we could take stroller walks with our baby this resort definitely has nice paths but we really did not fully appreciate the sheer size of this place before booking our trip the size factor was a bit of a negative for us and the likely reason why we probably would not go back tour operators ( and trip advisor for that matter ) advertise this hotel as 700-900 rooms ( which , to my mind , is already pretty big ) but it 's actually two hotels ( the gran bahia principe bavaro and the gran bahia principe punta cana ) that are located side - by - side , each with 700-900 rooms add to that , the specialty higher end clubs ( club premier , diamond club , hacienda club , etc so , you really have one big , huge resort with approximately 2,000 rooms this may suit some as you can really spend your stay in complete anonymity but , in our case , taking the trolley from our room to the beach , to restaurants , etc ( with a baby and stroller in tow ) was a bit of a negative the only other negative ( and addressed mainly to fitness enthusiasts ) , for such a big resort , the fitness centre is seriously lacking very small with a few machines , and opens late so , a very nice and enjoyable trip and a quality resort but be prepared to walk or take trolley rides 
maybe i 'm just too sensitive we stayed at the bahia principe from nov 1/07- nov 8/07 i have been to mexico , cancun  puerto vallarta as well as bahamas and aruba the bahia principe itselft was a nice hotel , a 5 star in the dominican though , is not comparable to a 5 star elsewhere from what i could see very large hotel , which is good , but difficult to coordinate with a large group , as the week goes on you get used to the trolly 's so its not so bad pool was very nice , food was okay , not bad , not really that great , i would have to say average , the breakfast buffet was probably the best part , though they did run out of bacon if you go there later than 9pm the beach was the best part about this vacation , it is definitley beautiful , soft white sand , not alot of shells and beautiful water the only other complaint would be that communication is hard as most of the staff could not speak english , we taught our cleaning lady a few words , she was very thankful you ca not blame the staff as they always made the effort , i feel the hotel should spend a little money and give their staff some english lessons , somehow i think they would be grateful that all being said , my main issue was not with the resort but with leaving the resort if you are a sensitive person , i highly suggest not leaving the resort the poverty in areas was hard to bear witness to , i know there is poverty all over the world , but i just cant relax and party when i know there are starving people and animals just ouside the resort i took some comfort in knowing that the resort was providing jobs , but the whole week i just kept feeling helpless at not knowing how to help those people also , being a huge animal lover , even harder were the stray dogs , on the beach , by the market and all over town if you are not an animal lover you many not even notice them , but for me it was heartbreaking there is one beautiful female dog , blind in one eye who visits the beach by the bahia , if you see her she really likes chicken and if very friendly , but wont let you touch her as she is somewhat timid and afraid , but will take food  water from you if you walk down the beach to the right of the boat ( in the water ) about 30 minutes down is a local market , there are also quite a few dogs and puppies down that way , the locals dont really seem to acknowldge them , however i did notice that the tourists ( some kind hearted one 's anyways ) do feed them scraps it is a beautiful island but for me the poor shacks and destitute looking stray animals in the reality outside of the resort , took most of that beauty away if i do go back to the dominican republic it will be to do something more active to help the people and the animals , not to sip daquiri 's on the beach 
i got bed bugs my trip was from oct 25 - nov 1 and heres my lil story the hotel was very nice and big beyond that heres what went wrong nobody spoke any english not even mangement level this was very very frustrating got a bill the first night for 4700 and they took 30mins and about 10 different ppl to realize it was not me who went to the spa the food was disgusting to say the least we managed on pizza and pasta the entertament at night was kinda boring by the third night you dont care to see them i got bed bugs urrrrrrggghhhhh let me tell you how [ - ]i am about this i did tell the maid to change the sheets everynight but i kinda had a feeling she didnt she did not know any english i am so so beyond frustrated about this i emailed the hotel about this and they didnt seem to care the usual i hope you enjoy your next stay with us and our ride to the airport from our hotel was hell the truck would not close and driver said its ok we finally told him no its not thats our luggage so we waited on the side of the road for another van and let me tell you i thought i was going to get robbed thats how scary it was i would never go back to punta cana or reccommed it to anybody i had a terrible time and ive been to jamica and cancun so its not like im anti - all - inclusive luck to all those who chose to travel to punta cana beware of this hotel and room 27310 
a restful vacation we arrived at the resort not knowing how enormous the resort truly was we were quickly checked in , and then dropped off at our room that was still being cleaned by the maid we read through the hotel material , and realized that we did not have a copy of a map ( i encourage everyone to ask for a map when you check - in ) so we stumbled our way around until we met with our travel representative the next day he advised us off all of the hotel amenities and locations the resort provides a shuttle service from one end of the property to the other the beach itself was a long beautiful white sand beach it truly was a tropical paradise the grounds of the property are well kept and very clean with beautiful lush tropical foliage and palm trees the pool was beautiful with the added touch of a swim up bar at each of its pools our room was nice , we had a king size bed and jacuzzi tub we tipped our maid she ensured that our mini fridge was kept well stocked with an ample amount of water and beverages the room itself was well maintained and kept very clean however we are non - smokers and at nights we constantly awoke to a strong smoke smell in the room the food was wonderful we ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast and for four evenings we were pleased with the food and it quality we ate an ample amount of seafood , fruit , and a large array of other foods we believe that there is something for the pickiest eater the waiters were very very attentive so much so that i always felt like i was being watched as soon i ate the last morsel on my plate my plate was then quickly whisked away we ate at three of the a la carte restaurants ( seafood and japanese ) my personal preference was the seafood hands down it was absolutely exceptional there is much to do at this resort i went to the spa , my husband and i played mini gulfed , walked extensively , we also went on an excursion to the countryside we would highly recommend this as it gives you a true reflection of the culture and the people of the dominican our only concern with this resort was the excessive amount of smoking and smokers at this resort there was smoking everywhere , people lit up at the drop of a hat with no regards for their fellow vacationers our room was on the third floor and the smoke from the other rooms would come into our room through the vents 
love and sweet we just return from a week at the bahia principe resort it 's very beautiful the beach was nice and we always able to find a nice seat the food was fantastic and fresh if the last minute price was right , you must stay and select the diamond club diamond club give us an extra night of fine dining also if you just want to stay at the pool and diamond club have their private pool which was never crowd also we can choose to have lunch at the italian dining which was locate at the diamond section ( shot walk ) as soon as you arrived , you need to book and reserve all your night dinning some restaurant only open on the select day we booked the following restaurant : janpanes dining - it was good and fun sea food dining - it was good the fresh paris dining - it was good but they only let you choose 1 appetizeitalian dinning - it 's ok but i would rather try the steak house which was full ( unable to book it ) my wife was very clean person the hotel was very neat and clean but sometime we do find some small ant the bath room was spotless the hotel people was very friendly and alway smile only problems was they do not speak much english due to our return flight was at 21:30, after we cheked out , we found out they did not have secure storeage they only have a store room for everyone to put the luggage in so we have to keep our valueable things with us all time overall , it 's good resort , worth while to stay there 
relaxing holiday we went to this hotel between 1st and 9th october , and it was great , very big place but everyone is really freindly place is so clean arrivng we had to go to diamomd check in , which took ages to sort out and it was really hot and we had just got off a 8 hour flight you get 4 la carte meals but book asap as they get booked up really quick and some are not even open buffa food isn , t great but its something , best to eat when its fresh , 12 and 7pm rooms are great , massive beds , bathroom and clearness air con bit noisy towels changed in afternoon and you have to remember to leave on floor or they don , t change bar is meant to be re filled every day with soft drinks , there rum and water but all we got was water and when left tip or note they took money but did 't re fill , bit cheeky lobby area is great , nice place to go during day and evening and the cocktails are lovely over there as every were else there in plastic cups and small see any entainment but there was show on was the best and so clean , there clearing it all day long and you don , t get no hassal either which is good , a striaght no is normally good enough if do though , pool is nice and clear but nosiy with all the games going on all in all great holiday but i , ve done it now and would 't go back 
a great week at the bahina principe 9/22-9/29 we did some extensive on line research before booking this hotel and we had some hesitations based on some of the reviews we 'd read but , we wound up getting a fantastic deal by booking an on - line special advertised right on the bahia principe website as others have mentioned , it 's worth noting that everyone has a different expectation level when they travel and people have also had vastly different travel experiences please take this into consideration when you read reviews that are filled with complaints let me start by saying my husband and i have travelled extensively i 've personally travelled all over the us , through 16 different countries in europe and 8 different islands in the caribbean i 've stayed in 5 star hotels with personal butlers and i 've slept in sleeping bags on rolled out cots so i would venture to say i have a good travel repertoire under my belt this resort was truly a great experience it 's a rather large resort with basically 2 mirror sides the bavaro side  the punta cana side each side has separate lobbies as well as separate restaurants but they each meet in the middle along a long road that leads to the beach on the first day it seems that this is an extremely long road but , you soon realize that 's it 's a really nice walk and that you do not necessarily need to take the shuttle that runs all day we stayed on the bavaro side of the resort and we upgraded to the diamond level the biggest reason we decided to do this was to get an additional night at the a la carte restaurants it turned out being well worth it due to the fact that we could take advantage of the private pool area offered to the hacienda  diamond level guests i refer to this as private pool but it was actually huge with a swim up bar for us it was just a nicer , quieter experience with a few less people than the main pool this upgrade also let us have lunch at the italian restaurant which is right off this pool foodthe all inclusive package for a week included 3 dinners at a la carte restaurants ( we upgraded so we had 4 dinners ) otherwise you eat at one of the large buffet dinners i 'm not a huge buffet lover but there is enough to satisfy picky eaters and it gives you the opportunity to try a ton of stuff food items change nightly so you never have to eat the same thing ( unless you want basics like fries , pizza , pasta etc ) we loved the japanese restaurant the sushi was excellent and the hibachi dinner allows you to try everything we also really enjoyed the gourmet restaurant ( on the punta cana side ) we had lamb chops  filet mignon and were very happy with both the pescadore restaurant was decent no raves but it was a good meal the only restaurant we were dissapointed with was the grill/steakhouse i had the mixed grill and my husband had a steak they were both very tough and chewy service/roomeveryone was soooo pleasant it was very rare to walk past an employee without getting an hola and a smile the room was a good size ( you do have to pay $28 to use the safe ) and was cleaned daily every day we found a new towel animal as well as fresh flowers that decorated our clean room we were called numerous times by staff concierge members to check on us to make sure we were happy and to see if there was anything else we needed service was very fast ( considering other caribbean islands where it seems staff can be rather slow to respond ) we had an iron delivered to our room in less than 5 minutes and we requested more water  diet soda and every day our fridge was well stocked pools/activitiesthere is a very large pool right by the water we found it to be somewhat crowded ( and we were there off season ) we never had trouble finding chairs but we preferred the diamond pool since it was a bit quieter the bartenders at the swim up bars were all great ( after a couple of days they would see my husband swimming up and they 'd have his new drink waiting for him when he got there the main pools had a variety of activities , games , volleyball , aerobics , bingo , dance lessons there really is a ton to keep you occupied if that 's what you 're looking for i spent a day getting a massage at the spa it is not a 5 star spa but it 's adequate and how can you complain when you 're relaxing with someone rubbing away all your stress there are also shows each night at the main theater where the staff dances and entertains i would suggest watching these shows they are a great way to enjoy some time after dinner other miscwe are non - spanish speaking americans and , we were definitely in the minority we did not even hear people speaking english until the 4th day we were there for us this was totally fine , for others it might not be it 's a huge destination for europeans  french canadians there were also quite a few staff members who did not speak english very well just remember you are in a spanish speaking country yes , there is a language barrier at times you should expect this and roll with it they all did a great job trying to accommodate the fact that we really do not speak spanish there is also an area just outside the hotel lobbies called pueblo principe it 's a self contained shopping area with a small casino , disco  a large stage that offers evening entertainment you should just remember that when you go to this area you are no longer in you all - inclusive package so if you order drinks at the late night show you should expect to pay for them hopefully you 've made it thru this long review and i hope it answered any questions you might have if i 've missed something you 'd like to know please feel free to email me 
extremely disappointed my husband and i have been waiting all year to go on a tropical vacation - - which was very disappointing our stay was 7days/6nts of full frustration and no relaxation our original reservation being booked by a website availabe to airline employees only was at the bavaro side of the hotel the hotel has 2 sides which mirror one another with the same amenites and we were told they were both accessible reguardless which side you were in we checked in at bavaro and they did not have a reservation at that side and wheeled us in a tram over to the punta cana side they put us in a room at the bavaro side , but only were allowed to use punta cana amenties , bar , buffet , etc once in the room , housekeeping had to be called the first night because of hairballs on the floor , which had to be mopped and sanitized our sheets had to be replaced because of sour linens , our toilet overflowed , and at least twice we had no washcloths there are 3 pools , but you can only use 2 if you did not upgrade to the royal club - - which simply means you have a cabana boy and an extra night to make a reservation at the restaurant of your choice - - - which fill up very quicky this is a huge property and very loud it is filled with all ages the only thing that made this trip was that the people of dominica are beautiful and very respectable i researced this property several months before travelling thru tripadvisor and it is listed #4 out of 56 hotels i am not the type of person who listens to what other people say , but maybe next time i should the food was definitely not to our liking and sometimes could not even tell what it was my husband and i travel every year to the carribean and this was definitely our first letdown in 5 years sincerely , timmelindasan antonio txp as a manager of a major airline , we speak to many people in the business that are always looking of new places to travel - - this hotel beware 
but we travelled with first choice again on this holiday , our second time to the dominican republic but the first time to this hotel , flight was excellent as usual - no delays , and we were checked in to the hotel on the way from the airport - so when we got there it was straight to our rooms to unpack the site is big - split into two punta cana and bavaro , down the middle ( something we were not aware of ) - the trams/buses that run are excellent , running from one end of the site to the other and very frequently - you wont have to wait long for one accommodation was really good ( although with hindsight we feel we should have changed our room - and advice would be if you are given a room at the back of the buildings which face the roads either side of the resort request a change as these roads are service roads used by the staff , when changing shifts , deliveries to restaurants , rubbish collection etc and therefore at certain times of the day very noisy ) our room was clean , tidy and the maid kept the room as such and we had some lovely towel displays make sure you try out the jacuzzi bath the food in the main buffet was good , but choice was limited - even on the theme nights , and on some occasions the food was cold/ luke warm however the salads and fruit selection was wide and on the whole a good selection available the only other thing worth mentioning here regarding this restaurant is the labels they put with the food - these were not always correct - for example , i decided one night to have vegetable soup ( labelled as such ) so imagine my surprise to find several bits of chicken in it ( i 'm not a vegetarian so did not matter to me - but if i had been - i probably would have stronger words to say ) the gourmet restaurants - the french restaurant - food was good ( would not class as a la carte - however ) we went twice ( due to a 2 week stay ) on our first visit the waiters tried to serve us with incorrect starters - twice on our second visit they took our dessert order and then forgot about us this restaurant appears to have good service when they are not busy - when they get busy they start panicking and things go wrong the mexican was ok - nothing special the italian was good , my husband found his starter particularly good as the choice and presentation was excellent - although we were told by our rep that she had had some mixed reviews the garden grill was a different story altogether - we found the service bad as well as the food - would suggest giving this a miss completely ( but we might have just hit it on a really bad night the japanese restaurant was fine - although my husband was a bit disappointed when he was offered tea expecting japanese but got a pg tips tea bag in a cup overall the sight was good , nice clean swimming pools and beach , on the whole the staff were friendly and made every effort to assist us if needed however , most of the staff could only speak limited english , which was an issue sometimes and we would recommend learning some basic spanish before going the evening shows were well put together , the dancers were good worth seeing the michael jackson show and the lion king is good for the kids ( we think both these shows tour the resorts ) would we visit this hotel again probably not , it was good , but for us it was too big , which may have impacted the service we received 
not 5 star but nice beautiful grounds , well maintained we were diamond upgrade in the bravaro side ( villa 30) , nice room with excellent housekeeping buffet was good as a matter of fact we skipped one of our nights at an ala - carte and went to the buffet as we wanted to stay in shorts by the way we noticed there was selective enforcement on the long pants rule should not have that rule anyway imho , food was good , but definately not 5 star by a long shot my only real complaint were the drinks at the swim up bar , very poor quality and limited selection you can only get what 's on the menu , bartenders are not allowed to make anything else even though the ingredients are available it would also be nice to have a variety of music ( it was all spanish ) 
enjoyed every minute i booked my trip at the bahia principe aug 18th to the 25th the resort is wonderful and very well kept the staff are very friendly but at times we had communication issues as we do not speak spanish and some have trouble understanding english or french but then again , i 'm on vacation and for me it 's not an issue i strongly suggest that if you book this resort that you pay the extra money for the royal golden treatment as it 's a very large resort and most of the action during the day is at the beach and the beach pool if you book golden your room will be near this area although there is a shuttle every 3-5 minutes the food in general was ok to good we booked at the french , fish , italian , steak and japanesse trust me on this , i enjoy good food and good wine and your best choice is the french and italian resturant the only one that really irritated me was the steak resturant we were 3, we all ordered the surf a turf and in all 3 cases the steak and the porc were burnt not overcooked , but literally burnt we ate the shrimp , my wife and i managed to cut a piece of the steak and porc to at least taste it which confirmed that it tasted exactly as how it looked my son never managed to cut a piece to taste it we simply got up and walked out and went to the buffet we spoke with people who went the next day and they also did not enjoy it remember people , what happens one day does not mean that it 's always like this i read reviews from people that mentionned it was the best steak they ever had so obviousely something was different when they went i just wanted to mention it but lets not generalize as for the wine , white or red , if you took a couple of drinks before , yo man , no problem , but if you did not well you can make your own opinion on it we were lucky we got a room in building 20, the best in my opinion we were next to the beach and the beach pool and we had 2 snack bars and the fish resturant in which we could have breakfast and lunch therefore we did not have to go to the main buffet at the other end much if you want a great vacation i strongly suggest this resort and i would go back tomorrow if i could have a nice vacation 
went solo and loved it i had to take a trip by myself because my girlfriend was not able to leave her commitments and i was on my own and on total burn out after having passport canada lose my passport renewal for three and half months i booked the holiday at the last minute and have never been to punta cana after reading some of the ??ad reviews? trip advisor i was getting concerned that i may have made a mistake as i really did not want any issues during my holiday so i decided to drop my expectations on every level and just ride with it , as i knew the beaches are beautiful and all i wanted at the end of the day was sand , surf and rest ( ok i also wanted to look at bikinis ) ( girlfriend will discuss this with me after reading ) well to make this short and sweet the hotel is very nice , the pools are great , the beaches are wow , the staff was very pleasant ( much better than mexico ) , the room was nice and very clean , there was one person tending the property every ten feet , the food was so so the food was? hit and miss? depending on where you ate the french restaurant was great as so was the italian the buffets for breakfast , lunch and dinner became very routine and boring overall from a value point of view i think it was very worth while my suggestion is to not worry about the food and focus on losing yourself in the beauty of the area and the hotel itself 
fabulous resort just returned from the dominican republic and thought i 'd post my comments on the resort overall , the resort is top class the grounds and beach are immaculate the rooms are of excellent standard and fastidiously clean the staff cannot do enough for you , they are friendly , professional and always ready to help the two smaller pools are fantastic and yes , stay away from the main pool by the beach , full of algae and rammed with people in our opinion the food is well above average for an all inclusive the buffet is great and yes if you have every item every night , it could be repetitive you are able to book 3 a la carte restaurants per week and we highly recommend the french le gourmet , it was fantastic the italian is okay and the 'garden grill ' well above average the beach bbq is well below average the only appeal is the bbq 'd lobsters , everything else is bland and below par we did not enjoy the beach buffet as the food was exposed and attracted flies and other insects the evening entertainment was average and not to my liking , the shows reminded me of a 'butlins ' style attraction the pueblo was okay although stay away from the shops and markets there , the prices were astronomical stay away from the casino zzzz boring and it 's important to note that you will have to pay for your drinks here we had 3 excursions planned the outback safari was a thoroughly enjoyable day with a fantastic tour guide showing you the 'real ' dominican life you visit a coffee plantation , a local home , school visit , and you end the day with a boogie board trip to a local beach the speedboating trip was a half day excursion which my boyfriend and i loved we did not enjoy the snorkelling though , which was over - managed and with very little to see in fact , sadly , most of the reef in the dom republic is barren and lifeless we were 'supposed ' to go on the saona island trip but the holiday rep ( first choice ) failed to tell us that this had been cancelled imagine our 'delight ' at waking up at 5:30am , ready in reception for 6 30am and sitting there for one and a half hours and finally giving up and going back to our rooms when we finally got hold of our holiday rep , she informed us that she was certain that the local rep had told us that the trip had been cancelled yeah right , because i do enjoy getting up at 5:30am just for fun there are only a few negatives for my holiday one is the resort is just too big , there are hundreds of people staying and at times the beach - front was overcrowded and the pools full the second negative is that the dominican republic is ridiculously expensive , it is geared towards the tourist market and they ask for ludicrious amounts of money for the smallest thing my boyfriend 's daughter wanted a half head of braids and they wanted us$50 at the airport , i bought 2 burger meals from the wendy store and they wanted us$18 my boyfriend wanted to play a round of golf but declined when hearing the price was us$150 overall , a great holiday and i would definitely recommend it perhaps even coming back one day pack loads of sunscreen , you will need it 
my boyfriend and i stayed at the gran bahia punta cana on the punta cana side from august 5th -12th we had a fantastic time however , we did have a small incident during our stay there pros : check in : they made us check in on the bus to the the hotel by the time we got off the bus , they offered us a cocktail and took us straight to our villa i was shocked to see a tiny bell boy carry two suitcases of about 40lbs each and and a carry - on up to the 2nd floor on his own food : we made our reservations on the morning after we got there we were in the golden club so we had four a la carte reservations the mediterranean , the mexican , the italian and the the gourmet i absolutely loved all four of them , however the mexican was my favourite considering we had fantastic service ( not that the other restaurants had bad service ) the buffet was also great food is different every night and the breakfast is fantastic i loved the fact that there was a chef making eggs however you wanted them staff : very friendly , anyone who walks by you will say hola and smile at you if you have a problem , they will try their best to help you bavaro runners : this is a must it was definately the highlight of our trip you really get to know people from your ( and other ) resorts we had a fantastic time on this trip well worth the 80$many people on this site also comented about getting diarreah this frightened me a little so i went prepared with 3 different types of diarreah medications my boyfriend nor i had any problems with that i didnt even brush my teeth with bottled water and i was perfectly fine i think as long as you dont drink a gallon of water from the tap you should be fine the water and ice cubes they serve you in the pitchers at the restaurants is filtered water so you have nothing to worry aboutbeach : gorgeous beach people have stated that there isnt enough space under the palapas by 9am my boyfriend and i got to the beach at around 11 every morning and we just walked 2 mins down the beach and we found space under a palapa every time cons : during our stay at the gran bahia principe we did have an incident which i was not too pleased about everything went fine the whole time we were there until the day before we left we had gone to the beach and got back in the afternoon to rest only to notice that my earings had been broken by someone who entered our room while we were gone , even though the do not disturb sign was on our door knob we went to file a report about it and obviously the maid denied it they compensated us by giving us two tshirts and a bottle of rum which we were supposed to get upon our arrival to our room anyway , considering we were golden members by reading other peoples reviews on the site , i have noticed that there had been quite a few incidents similar to mine with the staff there we had to pay for the safe i have been to other resorts and this is the only one where we had to pay for the safe its not the money so much , just the hassle of having to go to the main desk , sit down with a staff member it should just be included in the price like at other resorts nudity : i dont know if this is actually a con but for me , coming from america , i am not accustomed to nudity in public i saw middle aged women doing fitness aerobics on the beach topless that is not my idea of a relaxing day advice : well first off next time i go on vacation i will put everything of value in the safe at all times , even if you have to squeeze everything in dont take the chance the staff will not ( or rarely ) replace or give you money for the items lost/stolen/broken and if they do , it will certainly not be of equal monetary value the sun there is not the same like in other parts of the world it is much stronger atleast wear fps 40 trust me you will thank us later relax and enjoy ( and dont forget ur sunscreen ) 
bad food , dirty buffet restaurant it?? been over a month since i came back from punta cana , and at first i thought i should wait before writing a review thinking , i might change my mind i?? a big fan of this site and not only write reviews but highly depend on tripadvisor for my travel planning to give you an idea about my travel background????e traveled extensively??o anywhere from a two star to luxury hotels in asia and the middle east this was my fourth trip to the dr , and the second to punta cana excellent : what i would give a 4+ star ( nota 5star ) ? rooms in a great shape ( no bugs ) ? beach , beautiful and clean? bathrooms , shower very clean ? 2 small pools , excellent ( the large main pool is a disaster , and filled with algae ) ? the grounds are beautiful? the hotel large is but not overwhelming? the open market concept adds a lot to the hotel and it is nice but expensivegood : 4 star? the air - conditioned restaurants? the italian restaurant ( and only the italian restaurant ) ? the club is nice , but too much salsa and meringue songs? customer service is good at the italian restaurantpoor : 2 or 3 star? overall the food is mediocre and repetitive ? the buffet restaurants is filled with bugs and flies? the buffet restaurant is stinky , literally it stinks and makes u sick the waiters and waitresses are rude and are not trained properly? the drinks are water down big time , and i?? not a drinker? pool towel service is horrible on several occasions we had to wait 1 hou entertainment??oring , even the lion king , which i had read so much about the staff don?? motivate people to get involved in competitions , dances and sports like many other resorts , so the resort is too quiet and in a way boring we were in a group of 6, one of got sick and the doctors are ??ell??o comment we just paid $160 usd for a short visit and 10 antibiotic pills 
second time at gran bahia - - the good and the not so good this was our second visit to the gran bahia principe punta cana , the last being may 2006 the good : being second time guests at the bahia proved to have many perks on day one - - we received a bottle of rum , cigars , polo shirts , baseball caps and a small bottle of scotch we have been repeat guests to other resorts and have never received such special treatment - - we were very impressed we stayed in club golden , and were in building #20- - the first building on the beach - - good location ( but we prefer building 1 on the punta cana side ) we were able to make reservations for dinner for as many evenings as we wanted we dined at the italian , mexican ( our favorite ) , the japanese , the meditteranean , the beach bbq we also had reservations for the gourmet , but did not make it due to a bad storm that evening the service and food was very good at the mexican , japanese , italian and meditteranean - - the bbq it was not so good maid service was good - - towel art furnished daily one day the balconies were decorated with swans made from beach towels , and balloons were on all doors the room was decorated with flowers several days also main pool bar was the best - - german and luis are the best bartenders on the resort - - they definitely aim to please the weather was good , with the exception of one evening thunderstorm the beach is gorgeous , but was crowded towel game was definitely played 30 to secure our spot - - most days there were not many huts left by 9:00 a the not so good : entertainment seems to be very repetitive - - same music , same activities each day i feel this has gone downhill since our last visit the lobby bars close at 11:00 sharp - - leaving no alternative but the pueblo or karoke bar until the disco opens at 12:00 other resorts lobby bars remain open until midnight the entertainment in the lobby bars is also the same every night the karoke bar is very poorly run a huge songbook , but most songs listed are not available , the management allows large groups to go up and scream their song - - not very amusing - - many people got up and left the person running it really does not seem to care the rudeness of some of the non - english speaking patrons has been addressed here before naked children in the swimming pool - - obviously no health department here overall , we had a good time at the bahia - - but we did have to make our own fun we also met some great people from missouri , michigan and d we definitely will return to punta cana , but most likely will try another resort 
great until the last day my son and i stayed at this resort from july 22 to july 29 everything was great until the last day the hotel , service , rooms , pools and ocean were all great the food was o as far as excursions go the jurassic buggys was fantastic , but the bucaneros speed boats was not so great and most of the boats were really unsafe to use my son became very ill on the friday evening with a high fever i took him to the hotel physician who was not much of a help and was told that my travel insurance through my employees benefits plan would not be accepted , and that i would be charged and would have to request reimbursement through my benefits when i returned home fortunately , he did not charge me as nothing was really done for my son the same evening , it had taken 4 calls to housekeeping to request a warm blanket for my son as he had the chills after over an hour , houskeeping came with two bedsheets and said that a warm blanket was not available at that time of night (9:00 p ) i also notice that some of my son 's belongings that were kept in a drawer were missing i contacted customer service in the hotel and was told that security would come by to determine who had been in the room as they could access the card reader of course security did not show up and i was not reimbursed my son ended up contracting pneumonia at the hotel and was taken to hospital upon our immediate return to canada i called the resort to advise them of my son 's illness so that they could possibly look into whether more guests had contracted pneumonia there and take effective action customer service at the hotel said i needed to make a formal complaint via email for this to be actioned upon , no matter how much i stressed the possibility that this illness could be travelling throughout there resort i had advised them that i did not have immediate access to email and i was concerned for new guests that were at the resort again i was told to put it in writing to them for any travellers going to this resort , you may want to call ahead to ensure that there are no strains of illness going around i wish i 'd had as my son was very ill for over two weeks 
gran bahia is good my husband and i stayed here july 28 - august 4 for perspective , this was our 4th all inclusive beach vacation - - and the 1st we would actually consider returning to ( because there are so many other places we want to see ) like many , i read every review before booking and before traveling , so i would know what to expect we 've stayed at riu and palace resorts in mexico and sun village in puerto plata , dr , for comparison resort/rooms : beautiful dominican people are very hard working and the grounds are immaculate suites are large and comfortable beds were comfortable  we never heard neighbors ( we have before at other resorts ) rooms were cleaned and mini - fridge plentifully stocked we did not have a coffemaker the 1st day  wanted more soft drinks  water , so we left a note ( in english ) they were there that afternoon we did leave small gifts  $$ each day , but i do not think it would have changed the service we got yes the resort is very large , but the tram makes it easy to get around beach : beautiful we go for the beach - - not pools ( which we can do at home ) , so this is a make or break for us the water was clear ( though not quite as clear as cancun )  refreshing there is a constant breeze off the ocean that keeps you cool ( if you 're from the south , like we are - - it actually felt cooler than we do at home in louisiana ) there are fees ( $25) for lessons to use some of the free water sports , but after that it was great to have something at the resort to do we booked a day or two before we wanted them food : we loved the food the buffet had plenty of choices - - but like others have said , if you eat everything off the buffet at one meal , you wo not have much variety the next night but who tries to eat everything at once we also think our creole food in louisiana is very similar to dominican , so we may have enjoyed it more than others if you are used to good mexican food , do not go to the mexican restaurant , though the japanese and the steakhouse were both great great service  food in both again , we tipped everywhere even the buffet , but i do not think it made much a difference in service bars : this was our only complaint about the resort - - in a resort this size i would have expected more beach bars there was so much beach front owned by the resort , and only 1 bar we either had to walk a ways or stay close to the bar - - and we are not especially heavy drinkers we just wanted to stay hydrated in the heat we did bring our bubba mugs  they were great about filling them with whatever we wanted also , we like to relax by the beach in the evening  we could not do that here - - but the lobby bar had great entertainment every evening  that substituted for us tours : we did the saona island tour  it was great my husband wanted to deep sea fish  we spent the extra money for a private 1/2 day charter - - that was wasted money if you 're thinking of fishing , do not expect much here the other 3 - 4 boats did not catch either  it looked like they had not in days , even though it was supposed to be peak season for lots of species oh , well , we 'll just have to go to cabo to catch that marlin summary : we loved the resort itself and the dominican people this was our 2nd trip to dr so we knew how friendly they are we were surprised at how unfriendly the europeans were we would smile and try to converse  they would not even try they would cut in front of you at bars , buffet lines one night a buffet worker fell with a tray of food and the guests around here actually laughed and applauded - - i felt like i was back in high school ( actually i teach high school and expect better behavior from my students we also found it unsettling that there was so much toplesssness ( and complete nudity by some who publicly changed clothes ) with so many children around at other places , the women would put their tops on to walk around , but here they stroll the beaches just a note for parents like i said before , the resort and the area are beautiful , but if we go back we will probably look for a resort that has more americans 
will not return food was horrible mostly all buffet which was bad quality they limit the amount of reservations u can make at a restuarant on the property i stayed for 3 nights and they only allowed me one reservation , but when i went to make a reservation evrything was booked they finally got me into a restaurant and there were like 20 tables empty so i dont know whay they said everything was booked not that it made a difference anyway bcuz the food was just as bad as the buffet food all the drinks/liquor are watered down the beer is not true dominican beer like presidente the service was just ok the a/c doesnt cool enough and there in so a/c in the lobby or propety the restaurants do not have good a/c/ either same exact food day after day all in all will not recommend it and will not go back if you are picky like i am , do not spend your $ here 
a beautiful all - inclusive resort after a stressful year , my husband and i wanted absolute relaxation in beautiful surroundings and that 's what we found at the bahia principe in punta cana in our opinion , many of the negative comments about this resort come from those travellers who simply do not enjoy the all - inclusive resort experience our favourite caribbean destination is cane garden bay in tortola ( definitely not an all - inclusive vacation destination ) but the advantage to the all - inclusive resort vacation is that you do not even have to think about where to eat , what to drink , how to get to the restaurant ( and drive back after a few cocktails ) , and - - most difficult of all - - how much to pay for food , drinks , and entertainment ( all of which can be extraordinarily expensive for what you get , on islands like tortola , nassau , barbados , and jamaica ) the bahia principe provides a top - notch generic caribbean vacation experience the dominican staff is welcoming , competent , friendly , and even caring there is always something delicious to eat at the buffet the specialty restaurants are fun the cocktails are the best ( and strongest ) of any all - inclusive we 've been to the grounds are manicured the beach is absolutely lovely and the weather ( july 4 to 20) was perfect that having been said , if you cannot abide crowded swimming pools , guests who reserve their lounge chairs early and never return to them , and children allowed to run wild by their parents , possibly you should consider another type of summer holiday i have nothing but admiration for the staff and management of the bahia principe this resort runs like a well - oiled machine the staff must be treated relatively well , for the vast majority are happy to meet you and go out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful time this goes for the wait staff in the buffet ( alfonso is a great example ) as well as those in the specialty restaurants little problems happen on any vacation but the administration is quick to remedy them in a polished and efficient manner one criticism : there is no book exchange operating at this resort if you run out of holiday page - turners , you are out of luck suggestion to the bahia - - why not start a book exchange at the beach barbeque restaurant this is done at the bahia principe tulum in mexico and it works fantastically well when you are finished with your book , you can leave it at the restaurant and take another one from the shelf some pointers : no need for water shoes , there are no rocks underfoot in the water or on the beach guests at this resort dress for dinner and evening entertainment it was fun to dress up for the specialty restaurants and then sit in the lobby bar after supper the flaming coffees are the best the filet mignon was the most delicious and tender that i 've had in the caribbean rolando gives excellent spanish lessons every day in the beach barbeque restaurant (11:00) thank you , bahia principe , for an excellent two - week break from the stresses of real life we came home energized and rested 
gran bahia beach is beautiful we stayed at the gran bahia principe from july 18th through the 23rd with a party of 14 people the place is beautiful but it is as huge as everyone says we stayed in building 7 by the beach the lower the number the closer to the beach there are trams that run you back and forth from the beach to the lobby they are no problem to get on but i would prefer a little bit of a smaller resort but i have to say the grounds were beautiful and lush everywhere you looked beach and service : the people who worked at the resort were always helpful and ready with a smile i really enjoyed how nice they were if you are a beach lover ( we are ) you will love it it is really one of the nicest beaches we have ever been to and we have been to quite a few to get the best seating on the beach get up a little early and save your seats i know some people do not like that but we spent the entire day there so it was important enough to me to get some shade food : the food was not our favorite thing about the resort we were in the dominican republic and of course their food was prepared the way they eat we just did not care for it that much ( the buffets ) the ala carte restaurants we went to were great we went to the japanese , italian and medditerrean we enjoyed them all very much make your reservations early rooms : absolutely no complaints they were large and clean the beds were pretty comfortable and they were kept nice and clean by the staff ( leave a few dollars every day ) entertainment : the shows are not very good we watched one or two we may have missed a few of the good ones they had the lion king which seemed like a nice production but we did not stay the casino is tiny and has very few slots ( what i play ) and just a few table games not a great casino but it was something to do excursions : we booked the speed boats it was 4 hours long left at 12:00 pm and got back a little after 4:00pm everyone who went really enjoyed it they took you to a small island and after speed boating you went snorkeling we also took a bannana boat ride a big tube that is pulled through the water five of us took the ride and it was only 10 or 15 dollars a person and we had a blast overall : we got a great price and it was more than worth what we paid you truly make your own good time and if you love the beach you will not be disappointed by this beautiful place 
a big dissapointment i have stayed at other resorts in punta cana and always had a terrific time great food , great service , spectacular rooms , beautiful scenery , you name it but not this time i had to go on business to sto and decided to bring my son and his friend and add a trip to punta cana as a hs graduation celebration for them someone tole me about bahia principe i booked three nights and paid extra for the golden circle treatment what a mistake the staff was rude , which was a great surprise because the dominican people are very friendly and go out of their way to accommodate you but the staff in this hotel seem grumpy all the time the food was horrible they advertise that you can eat at any of their 5 restaurants , what they do not tell you is that you have to make reservations when you get there and by then all time slots are taken we ended up eating in the main buffet place and the food was canned and ill prepared we finally got reservations at the mx place and it was mediocre at best one thing that was awesome was the tours we took we had so much fun the first day we took a speed boat , that you actually drive yourself ( for about 45 mins ) to get to the a snorkeling area which was absolutely beautiful huge colorful fishes that come right up to you the next day we went horseback riding to a cave that has water whole we could swim in , then we switched out of the horses and into a dune buggy to go to a postcard beautiful pristine beach we had the most fun ever on the tours but it had nothing to do with the hotel , you could take these tours at other hotels i certainly recommend staying anywhere but at the bahia principe we area already planning our trip to punta cana for next year , but not here 
would not return stayed at this hotel in mid july , bavaro side , there were seven of us the goodrooms very spacious , cleaning staff work hard and do a good job , room was generally spotless throughout stay , the cleaning staff really deserve to be tipped daily generally , the resort is well maintained , and it 's fit and finish is up to 5 star resort standards as far as i could see , all common areas are kept very clean the beach is great , water temperature perfect , water clean , plenty of chairs , no problems here pools are generally well maintained , although the part of the pool where the pool bar is at the beachside main pool was discustingly green one day , it was clearly from all the people who do not bother to get out of the pool to use the toilet , it 's not the resort 's fault , but it 's a real shame that people treat the pool like a toilet , saw this very clearly on second day there , never stepped foot in that pool the not so goodresort is just too big , and there are so many people everywhere you go , ca not get a moment 's peace outside your room beach/pool towel service was ridiculous , we were routinely told that there were no fresh towels and would not be any for 30 minutes to one hour , i have never experienced this before at any resort and it 's simply unacceptable , i know it 's not the end of the world , but frankly , it was quite annoying to have this happen to us almost daily saw two gigantic roaches , one in the lobby and one outside , i know they ca not be controlled in a tropical climate , but i mention this because i think some people would really want to know this before booking their holiday again , however , never saw any insects at all in room , requested upper floor rooms and used towel under door , never had any problems service at the buffet restaurants is hit and miss , some staff work very hard to give good service , while others disappear never to be seen again , occasionally had a hard time just getting water the badthe food was generally of poor quality by the third or fourth day , we found ourselves making a real effort to actually find stuff to eat at the lunch and dinner buffets it 's very repetitive , they have theme nights , but they only change 5 or 6 things out of the 50 things they have at the buffet believe me , i 'm not a picky eater and as i type this i 'm actually shocked that i could not find something to eat with so much variety , but the reality is that you can have all the variety you want , if the quality is not there it 's just not worth it the only exceptions to the bad food were the breakfast buffet , the japanese restaurant , and the french restaurant which were fine the beach bbq restaurant was a complete joke , it 's worse than the buffet , infact , we left hungry and went to the buffet to eat after that a la carte booking overall , i would say our trip was fine , just wish we did not have to dread the meals all the time 
another great stay this was our second visit to gran bahia principe we are frequent travelers to the mayan riviera and feel that we have a pretty good basis for comparison we learned a lot the first time that we could apply to our return visit we were upgraded to the premier section in december at no cost when we arrived we asked for this on our second visit and were cheerfully accomodated , again at no extra cost since we were return customers , we were given a free safe and several extra touches - 2 complimentary golf shirts and hats , and fruit plates we did not make our restaurant reservations promptly enough to get what we wanted during our first stay we emailed ahead to customer relations and were given 4 excellent dining times in july we learned that you can be driven right to the a la cart places if you just ask the tram drivers we loved the lunch menu at the snack bar in the premier section they served great grilled stonefish and chicken/shrimp kabobs it was a refreshing change from the buffets our very favorite place was the garden grill we also loved the special coffee tables that were in the big lobbies at night our rooms and the pools were very clean we took treat bags with dollar store items and left a few dollars a day for the maids we always had plenty of towels and the frig was always stocked we took large insulated mugs with us to the beach and pool bars it was very hot and these ( purchased at wal - mart ) kept our drinks cold for 3-4 hours they were so big that they lasted us that long they do not come around to to drink orders , so this solved the problem of having to get up and go to the bar how lazy are we the bartenders were great about filling them for us we found the quantity of liquor to be very sufficient , but they were always willing to make drinks stronger upon request our luggage was delivered to our rooms and picked up for departure within 10 minutes of our request although we tipped most of the help , we never at any time saw anyone with their hand out waiting to be compensated we enjoyed the music in the lobbies , but were not thrilled with the quality of the evening shows water aerobics and learning the dances by the pool were a hoot , but wore on you by the last day try to get a room on the 3rd floor if you can handle climbing the stairs the footsteps above you will drive you crazy if you are below a nightowl guest take your own laptop to the lobby if you need to communicate with anyone at home they have computers for you to use on a first come/first serve basis , but they do not have a signup sheet anymore and you often get bumped build up your intestinal immunity for a few weeks ahead of your trip we drank danactive we also got a prescription for antibiotics in the event that the bug would strike it did hit a few of us on both trips to varying degrees avoid the fresh fruits with no skin and the creamy coconut drinks that does not sound like fun , but we found it to be helpful we did notice lots of little gnats flying around the fruit at the buffets this resort is gorgeous at christmas time the weather is less humid and still great for swimming and sunning watch out for the guys in the white outfits at the airport they will grab your luggage and it is a tug - of - war to get it back these guys are worse than timeshare salesmen in summary , we enjoyed both of our visits and found almost everyone to be helpful , friendly , and courteous we enjoyed the varied ethnicity of the guests and the change of pace the beach was gorgeous we loved not being bothered by timeshare salesmen we still prefer the resorts in mexico , but highly recommend that anyone who wants to visit d give this resort a try a happy traveler from toledo , ohio 
no where near a 5 star rating this resort definitely has the layout of a 5 star facility but comes no where near providing the service of one i have travelled to numerous islands and europe and recognize the varying standards of food and service i will never return to this resort nor will i recommend it to anyone there is visible security on the beach however vendors walk up and down the beach soliciting guests to buy their jewellery , hats , etc there is a vendors ' market on the property should guests wish to purchase those types of items dont bug people relaxing on the beach there was a dog that ran up and down the beach every day again , security just sat there at one point the dog approached a young child and snipped at her had the father not been attentive of the situation who knows the damage that could have been done nothing was done about a dog on the beach at a 5 star resort the beach is absolutely gorgeous however the constant traffic of motor boards and the smell of fuel from their motors definitely takes away from the beauty of it the ala carte restaurants were good we ate at the italian , mexican , bbq and mediterranean the staff were very friendly and the food was presented well it was very disappointing that they did not inforce the dress code its made very clear on your reservation ticket plus when you make your reservations that men must be in pants and women in acceptable attire there were people in shorts and tshirts service in the general areas was hit and miss on two occasions we approached the snack bar bar and asked for 2 beers in spanish and it was if we werent even standing there beers were literally handed over our shoulders to other guests that had a approached the bar after us and then we were served at the buffet we had to flag down staff in order to request a glass of wine with our dinner , which typically didnt arrive at our table until we were almost finished eating our room was very nice their definition of a serviced mini bar in the room was 2 beers twice during the week in the fridge the fridge itself bearly kept the beverages chilled even with the temperature turned all the way up it varied from day to day how many towels we were left on several occasions we were only left 1 bath towel we had a ground floor suite and upon returning to our room 1 day the maid , having cleaned the room , had left our sliding door unlocked fortunately we had rented at safe ( $30us ) thats another thing i have never encountered being charged for a safe at a 5 star resort another day we returned from the beach at 5:30 and our room hadnt been cleaned yet each day we had even left a tip for the maid in hopes things might turn around we spoke with several other guests of the hotel both during our vacation time and upon returning to canada and they had encountered similar problems if this resort is classified as a 5 star resort i would hate to think how deplorable things are at the 3 and 4 star resorts i cant imagine paying peak season prices for this resort 
never again , what a mistake food : rate it - 0i have been to punta cana for 3 years in a row i have stayed everywhere , and everything has always been perfect one of the reasons i kept going back was the food lobster , great seafood , etc this year i made the mistake of booking this hotel i went to the seafood restaurant and all they had was salmon i really was not expecting that in the carribean the only had lobster one night in my whole 7 day stay the excursions all promise you a lobster feast , and when you get there you get pork chops if you 're lucky you also have to make reservations for the restaurants , and of course there are never any reservations for the time or date you want the food in the buffet is ridiculous i felt like i never left the u frenchfries , salmon ,  burgers nothing worth getting fat over service : rate it - 9for the most part the service was excellent the servers did the best they could to accomodate the fact that the food was horrible at the end of the day they ca not do anything about it , the problem is way above them the preople there are very friendly , and speak various laguages they were overall very nice room  decorrate it - 10well , if they would 've spent half the money they spent on the marble floors on the food , maybe my vacation would not have sucked as much the decor was beautiful everything in marble , very clean and new , it was very nice atmosphere  activitiesrate it - 3one word , boring beach and more beach if you do not leave the resort on any excursions , you will be bored by the third day of your stay because there 's nothing to do there but sleep  tan the casino was the size of my bathroom at home the club was no where near what i would call a club ( maybe because i live in miami , i expect a littlemore ) the entertainment shows at night are not very etertaining so once you eat dinner , all there 's left to do is sleep the beach is very pretty , the water is not as clear as the bahamas but the sand is very soft the rental place for the beach activities such as the catamaran , kayak , etc is a nightmare to deal with you also have to reserve whenever you want to use any of the equipment and let me giveyou an example of my experience my appointment to for the catamaran was at 12 pm and was finnally able to ride it around 4 pm overall reccomendationrate it - 4i do not reccomend it at all unless you just want to lay on the beach for 7 days and not eat , do not bother if you do go you must : see - samana island ( not free ) saona island ( not free ) laguna gri gri ( not free ) eat - ( if they have it ) mangufondongolimocillos ( mamones ) coco loco ( drink ) 
beautiful but , not quite there the 2nd of our experiences with all inclusive vacations but , did not measure up to our stay in the mayan riviera while the hotel grounds are quite beautiful and the food offering was exceptional ( prior to some contrary reports ) , even room accomodations were great , there are some nuances which were bothersome all business transactions are conducted in american dollars no need to carry any r yet , very few hotel employees spoke any english even front desk workers were unable to communicate with the pools are beautiful and immaculately kept but , close at 6:00pm therefore , there 's not much to do after that time except , eat then plan to watch the nightly 'show ' which were sub - par daily activity information was also not readily available and not communicated room clean up times were also odd for after spending entire day at beach , in most cases room service did not arrive till after 4:00pm lastly , there is no out of resort area to visit worth speaking of at this time there is a new mall in punta cana but at time of visit was but 40% occupied and is / will be catered to an upscale crowd not , a local market type environment overall , if all one expects from a stay here is to lay on the beautiful beach or by a pool during the day hours then eat after hours it 's great but , frankly there 's nothing else left especially when traveling with our 15 year old who expressed extreme boredom 
stay away from the spa all in all , the resort was nice , pretty clean , the food was alright , and the beach was beautiful we loved the animation staff as well all i have to say is , if you are a woman , stay away from the spa do not get a massage from the male spa staff i did and i pretty much was molested he touched my breasts and was extremely inappropriate 
not fantastic first the good rooms are very nicethe beach is fantasticthe pools are greatthe resort is spotlessthe service is excellentnow the badthe food the buffett was very mediocre ( almost bad ) and the ala carte mexican restaraunt el charro was pretty terrible we ordered the mix grill at el charro and i 'm not kidding when i tell you the the chicken part of the mixed grill were two little chicken wings we did fare better at the garden grill and the french restaurant the garden grill was pretty good and the french restaraunt was great my fiance developed the flu while we were down there and is still recovering ( they have doctors available 24 hours ) i got a nasty stomach bug that i am still dealing with three days since returning becareful what you eat and drink i thought i was and still got sick but otherwise , you will have a great time we found the best part of the trip just sitting on the beach and going swimming and sailing ( if you know how to sail a hobie cat , you will have a great time the prevailing winds are great ) but with that said , i think this was our last all inclusive we did sandles in jamaica last year and found the overall quality of the food a lot better but next time i think we will just head to a five star hotel or rent a villa 
we just got back from a week at bp (2 adults + 3 kids , 15, 7, 4) what a bliss to be back home i 'll start off by saying that i am a picky traveller when i pay for a 5 star , that 's what i expect , and that 's not what we got a 5 star in cuba , in dr and in mexico are 3 very different things , and we are used to the 5 star mexico style check - in : amazing we went golden , with air transat , and the check - in was made on the bus , on the way to the hotel paperwork , bracelets , etc besides being very close to the beach , the quick check - in , having a ' 'concierge ' ' and extra reservations at the ? la carte restaurant , not sure going golden is worth it rooms : we were in a building closest to the beach (60) with 2 communicating rooms ( which i had requested directly at the hotel , by e - mail ) big rooms , quite nice we did not get the fancy towels or any extra attention ( guess it depends on the maids we tipped well every day ) biggest turn - off in the room , tiny black bugs everywhere , on the furniture , and in the bed took me over an hour to fall asleep every single night , never got to kill them all , they came from god knows where speaking of bugs , do place a towel at the foot of your door at night , this will keep them out i saw a cockroach slip under the door as i was about to place the towel one night much too big for my taste , especially with young kids in incredible heat the little train that drives you around the resort is hard to find at night , it does not come often , and when it does , it is often full food : i know this is dominican republic , and i was not expecting gourmet food , but i do not expect hamburgers to stay out in the sun for 3 hours either some people mentionned a horrible smell at the main buffet , it 's true i personally hated the food same thing over and over again , with a different sauce the food at the ? la carte restaurants was better than the buffet , but it still was not very good in fact , we all lost a few pounds our 2 eldest got sick ( even though i carefully watched everyone 's plate ) major cramps , diarrhea , fever , nausea i dreaded meal time , 3 times a day , for 7 days pack little snacks and immodium drinks : staff at all the beach and pool bars is very friendly their idea of a strawberry daiquiri is a glass of bright fushia liquid with 2 cubes of ice in it they do not blend it service : the staff 's english is either very limited or nonexistent service at the buffet is a joke the plates pile up on the tables , ask for an orange juice , get lemonade , etc service at the ? la carte restaurants is very very good beach : probably the nicest i have ever seen water is perfect , sand is beautiful a lot of people , but if you go all the way to the left , there are plenty of chairs in the shade , and many many palm trees watch where you step my 4 year - old daughter kindly handed me , on 4 different occasions , huge pieces of broken glass she 'd found in the sand i found about 10 during the week looked like broken drinking glasses the weather was beautiful , and very very very hot  humid pool : my kids loved it i had problems putting my toes in the water it was practically boiling not only was it not refreshing , but it was also a little sickening overall : my hubby and i agree that the resort is more like a 4 star , and that the food does not deserve more than a 3 we are mexico lovers , and that 's where our next trip will be it is well worth the extra couple of hundred dollars for those wanting their hair braided , the spot at the hotel will charge you 80$us for a full head take 3 minutes to walk to the little yellow hut on the beach ( left side ) , the ladies there are very nice , very quick , and will charge you a lot less they wanted 60$ for a full head , but i managed to bargain 60$ for both of my daughters we met couples and families that were really having a good time at the resort some were on their 2nd trip there , and were liking it just as much as the 1st time maybe dr is just not for us 
june 24 - july 1st we ( total of 6) were in punta cana and stayed at this hotel from june24- july 1st and had a really great time our tour operator was signature vacation and they arranged a plane for everyone from that operator to punta cana lucky for us , we were able to find our bus that takes us to the hotel without much trouble the tip is ??ollow the crowd? we saw ppl heading to the signature booth so that 's what we did once we got onto the bus , the signature tour operator gave us the wrist bands , information packages etc everyone else on the bus were told their rooms were ready except for ours : ( we landedat pc around 11am but did not get our rooms until 3pm so most of us just hanged in the lobby/explored the hotel this is a very big hotel it has 30+ villas , 3 pools and a huge lobby ( there?? another smaller section just north of the main hotel too it also has 10+villas , 1 separate pool and it?? own mini lobby ) the main hotel is really 2 hotels in 1 one side is called bahia principe punta cana and the other side is called bahia principe bavaro they are identical the only issue i had with their 2 hotel systems is if you are booked under bavaro , you can only do your check - ins , guest services and eat at certain restaurants in the bavaro side we originally suppose to stay in the bavaro side , but we ended up staying in the punta cana side of the hotel it 's a bit of walk under the summer heat so we always look for shades we took the tram to the pool and the beach most of our time was spend by the beach and we were able to find lawn chairs under the shade without much trouble even though it 's in the middle of the summer , but you wo not feel much of the heat because of the ocean breeze but it?? hot everywhere else in the hotel i didn?? expect there would be topless women in the beach , so it was a bit of a shockfor me you get used to it and won?? even notice it afterwards we stayed for 7 nights and got 3 a la carte restaurant nights the mediterranean was really good , the french restaurant and the steakhouse ( garden grill ) were good we ate at the main buffet restaurants many times because that 's where it has the most variety we walked into the punta cana side for buffet one day and told us we need to go to the bavaro?? buffet but they both serve the same food , so does it matter which side of the hotel you eat at we also tried the snack bar by the main pool and the food was ??kay? we asked the front desk about lunch and they told us there are 3 restaurants open for lunch ? mexican , seafood and italian we went to the mexican rest and they told us only seafood is open we went to italian rest and they told us it?? available for club diamond and premium members only for lunch you?? think the front desk checked our bracelets and then point us to the right direction hence we ate our lunch mostly at the main buffet l 5 out 6 of us got either minor ormajor stomach problem tips : do not drink the milk or put milk/cr?me in your coffee dominican pasteurized their milk differently , so it didn?? sit well with our stomach we also checked out a couple of their ??ightly grand production? in the theatre hall do not underestimate their talents these people can definitely dance my bf was extremely impressed with their productions his favourite was michael jackson we saw ppl tipped their favourite bartenders , etc? but we only tipped the maid twice , couple of times at the bar , servers at the a la carte rest and the folks during our excursion other than that , we hardly tipped anywhere else all in all , i enjoyed this hotel and luckily we didn?? have any major issues just minor stuff : the mini - bar could be cooler , bettercommunication among hotel staff , larger gym and more workout equipments but overall people were very nice , the maintenance is kept up very well everywhere and i?? go back to this hotel 
good holiday we have just returned to the uk after two weeks at the gran bahia principe our room was nice , clean and tidy we did have a few problems in the room , the air conditioning didnt work , our toilet seat broke , bed side light did not work and the safe broke did have to spend quite a bit of time going to the repecption to complain the main pool by the beach was very crowded and quite dirty did see a dirty nappy at the side of the pool and it was not moved for hours the sun beds were all quite cramped together and the music was really really loud we did move to another quieter and cleaner pool and was a lot happier the beach was lovely , lots of sun beds and plenty of space if you wanted to get away from the crowds on check out day two bell boy 's came to collect our suitcases from the room they stood in the bedroom patting their pockets and then putting our their hands waiting from a tip found this really uncomfortable and very rude of them never throughtout the holiday did anyone expect a tip until this episode we did tip regularly and service always inproved 
pretty good this is everything i learned from tripadivsor and my own experiences this was my first all inclusive so i do not have too much to compare it to but i read this site religiously for 2 monthes before departure and i had apprehensions about going my boyfriend and i stayed at the gbp june 10-17 we are both in our early 20's and did not find any disrespect regarding our age etc arrival : easy , ignore the guys trying to take your luggage , find your travel agency ( sunquest , signature etc ) and they 'll tell you what bus to go on the resort is huge , yes stop complaining though , it 's about a 15 minute walk end to end , give me a break with the way north americans eat , we all need the walk and you can eat alot there , depends on how picky you are we are picky so we thought the food was not the greatest we definitely survived on rice , pasta and fries for the week breakfast was by far the best meal served in the buffets , i say to stuff yourselves in the morning lobby drinks are the best pool was pretty gross , wipe yourself with a towel after exiting the pool , nice green algae beach is nice , a little seaweed but fun if you want to try the paddle boat etc there is a 1-2 days wait , so book it when you get there we had no trouble with line ups for reservations , or front desk trouble never had to wait longer then 5 minutes so i guess it has to do with timing could not get into the japenese restaurant though ( heard it was awesome ) went to garden grill and italian restaurant both were okay , not as classy as we thought it would be the bf got sick off the italian lasagna , paid for it the next few days trams run constantly shuttling you up and down the middle of the resort it mirrors eachother , bavaro and punta cana get a map ( one is handed to you on the bus ) and wander around the first day maid service was excellent , she was a sweetheart left her about 13 bucks throughout the week and lots of presents from the dollar store she left us wine , rum , t - shirts , and fresh flowers even a bubble bath with balloons in it one day and we were just standard suite with yellow wrist bands went down to get my hair braided , done for about 70 dollars ( us ) i have a lot of hair and it was full head of braids 5 hours and she was going fast ( she was really nice ) it held up well throughout the week but taking them out was a huge pain i would not get them again based on that alone overall i say to just enjoy yourself , i mean , if you go with a bad attitude , you 'll have a bad experience the people are so nice and courteous , be nice back : ) we went for the beach and the sun , and we got a great vacation mind you , we decided we could go to the beach up north and it would be a heck of alot cheaper i say try to it , just do not go with expectations of a high class 5 star resort that you would find in canada , because it 's not but they try pretty darn hard to be 
never going back i traveled to this resort with my boyfriend , soon as we reached the airport an everyone was rushing around and pushing you i knew this was going to be a disaster immigration and customs was so unorganized i was ready to pull my hair out we could not find our bus to the hotel we had to pay some one to find it for us once we reached the hotel i was so excited we were upgraded to the premier club because the punta cana side was all filled up this was not a very nice upgrade in my eyes we had our own pool but that was about it we were the farthest from the beach and food but i guess being far away from the food was a good thing i got sick after the first day we got there on a monday afternoon i got sick tuesday we came home friday i was not completely better till the following tuesday to make things worse the resort stunk of cigarettes and gasoline the entire trip there was no break from it i think that was part of my distress i spent a good part of the trip in my room to top it all off if you have fair skin spf 50 will not cut i applied over and over again and i got sun poisoning i could not lay down at all my boyfriend has a stomach like a rock and very dark skin he even got sick and a sun burn my advice to you if you plan on going here is be careful when i showered i kept my mouth closed tight i was sure not to consume any water maybe it was the ice cubes but they came from bags so who knows the nice part about the resort was the beach was beautiful the pools felt like bath water it was gross because you got no relief from the heat trust me it was warm the grounds were beautiful but slippery i almost fell walking around out side every day because they had sprinklers on and power washed every thing the language barrier is not that big of a deal the people who vacation there do not speak english we met no people the staff are friendly but i felt like every one looked at you like they knew something about you that you didnt definitely invest in the room safe i did not feel safe on the resort people can just pop in your room at any time over all the resort was beautiful but the food was disgusting , it made me so ill when we got home my boyfriend was not allowed to even say the name of the resort around me i had to wait a week to write this review because i was not able to think about the food with out feeling nausous good luck if you have the guts to go maybe june is just a bad month for the bahia principe because i read such wonderful reviews but it seems in the month of june the reviews have gotten negative oh on the way home be prepared to have your luggage searched 3 times in conclusion i would probably never return to the dr it was an experience i will never forget it was beautiful but my stomach cant handle it 
very disappointed we have just returned from our second visit to this hotel we were there same time last year and though we both suffered 'dodgy ' tummies then , you kinda expect that we have travelled far and wide and are extremely careful about what we eat and drink my toothbrush never touched any water from the tap - it was all done from the bottled stuff the hotel is fantastic clean , beautifully kept , the beach is to die for the comments written by others re the smokers are true i am extremely anti smoking and it was difficult to get away from it the dress code was not really adhered to either in the evenings we figured that if the staff are going to the trouble to lay a nice table and prepare your food you could at least make an effort and get out of those shorts and flip flops it seemed that bbcs were the dress of the day at breakfast sorry - not at a 5* place we ate in the french restaurant on our 6th night and i was violently ill all day the next day i went to hospital for blood tests ( as per the advice of the hotel doctor ) and got kept in for 4 days on various iv drips on my return to the hotel i was too weak to do anything but customer services were great and arranged 'plain ' food for me every night we missed most of our a la carte meals as i was so sick back home now and waiting for the hotel to get back to me after writing them an e mail am off work till at least 9/7 as i am so weak if you have booked - please take care what you eat and try to boost your immune system before you get there take extra care with youngsters both in the sun/heat and the food 
let the good times roll i have to say , the first night there , we were ready to book the next flight home the staff could not speak english , and all the restaurants and bars were closed it was h - o - t and we were dissapointed that we could not find a drink anywhere however , the following day , everything fell into place our tour guide ( nolitours ) showed us where everything was , such as the restaurants , entertainment , and the activities , and we were very pleased after that the buffet restaurants were alright , nothing special however , the a la cartes were amazing especially the garden grill the pools and the beach were extremely clean it was gorgeous as well as the lobby , which was a common hang - out place the nightlife was relaxing and the shows were entertaining overall , the place was very clean and the staff was great we had a great time 
completely inconsiderate and not accommodating the setting is a true paradise the resort is beautiful with great food and great drinks some staff members lacked english but considering that i speak spanish , that was the least of our problems the service was impressive it left such an impression that i will never consider returning the hotel was not accommodating to our needs even after we paid extra for an upgraded room members of staff from the male sex were absolutely the rudest , even to the point of whisteling and gawking at a woman in a simple bikini for service so disgusting , i would much rather enjoy a week in afghanistan my image of dominican republic , specifically punta cana , has forever been changed i sincerely hope that bahia principe clubs and resorts as a whole , does not share the same work ethics i will let grupo pi?ero , the administrative offices , know exactly how i feel about their resort in punta cana it was a true disappointment hope all who read this consider my opinion and think twice good luck bahia principe 
worst service ever i have been to all inclusive resorts in dr before and by far this is the worst when it comes to customer service we stayed here for a wedding and there were a lot of us first of all when we arrived and checked in they told us that they upgraded us because of the inconvience of having to stay in a room for one night and then we had to arrange the next day to be moved to our reserved location i had called ahead of time to request a crib be placed into our room i was assured that they always include it when they know a baby is traveling well of course the room had no crib and then we had to call several times to make sure someone showed up it took hours after we checked in and got to our room , it was around 5pm and we were starving we asked several people where they were serving food and when we went to see if food was available everything was closed until 6:30pm and then i found out we had to make dinner reservations dinner reservations at an all inclusive resort what 's up with that they have open buffets , no reservation needed , but i found this out a few hours later this place is way too big , and you have to take a trolley like car to get to different parts of the hotel there are also different levels of service ( wrist bands are different colors ) which limit where you can make dinner reservations since we had the platinum , we did not have a problem , but we did not know this ahead of time the next day when we went to change our rooms , i waited at the front desk for about 3 hours , constantly having to harass the staff asking , what am i waiting for where is my room , what is going on no one would answer my question , staff would disappear in the office and then would not come back with an answer the wedding guests filled the lobby , very pissed off and i was one of them , with a hungry cranky baby on my hands i was almost to tears , and someone nearby was crying she was so frustrated all we wanted was an answer , if the room was not ready , tell us that and tell us the time it would be so we could enjoy our time there rather than getting frustrated with the resort staff this resort does not know what customer service means then when we get to the room it was clean  nice and had no crib my husband called to request for one and we waited for an hour when he called again , they hung up on him what hotel staff hangs up on a guest he asked very nicely and was treated very poorly i would never , ever recommend this resort the worst part is they tried to buy us out at the end they offered us a free stay there again in the future exceptions : you could not use it during a holiday and during black out dates when i asked what black out dates meant , they could not/did not answer we told them no thank you please do not give this place your money worst service ever 
somegood - some not so good this was our seventh all inclusive trip (2nd to punta cana ) several cruises thrown - in love cruises , but all inclusive is the way - to - go the most bang - for - the - buck this resort is big , not overpowering but big enough that a person with a little mobility issue will notice english is language #3 or 4 we had to muddle our way through some of the staff conversations no major problem but compared to other resorts , very obvious the room was very nice turn down , jacuzzi tub , etc we do not smoke ( terrible , nasty , stinking habit ) , but 75% of the adults did this is a smokers paradise because they do not enforcement the no smoking areas this was disturbing this alone would prevent us from ever returning to this resort the food was good , just like all the buffets , you get a little tired of them but you gotta eat stayed 8 nights and ate mostly fruit the last two days the seafood specialty restaurant was horrible the steak house ok the japanese was the best the beach was beautiful and plenty of chairs , palapas again plenty of chairs and palapas the pool was missing a lot of tiles in places we have not seen this at other resorts pool maintenance seemed to be a bit slack the lousy crushable drink cups were left lying around for several days , mainly around the bridge areas , but still a lack of maintenance/cleaning let 's talk drinks did i mention the lousy crushable drink cups the drinks at the pool bars , other than the beer , were not good they do not make frozen drinks that stay frozen more than , 20 seconds this was a major problem for both of us their ice is just barely frozen and melts too quickly when mixed the lobby bar had much better drinks , but that 's a 400 yards away for most of the stay , the ice cream in the restaurants was more like thick milk than solid ice cream they have a real problem with keeping it solid the flavor was good , but here again , we wanted ice cream , not scoopable milk shakes we realize that this review is negative , but please remember , we have experienced better resorts and this review is based our experience from these resorts ( iberostar , riu ) this is still a good deal and nice vacation , we just did not like the differences the arrival process was smooth and simple pay your $10/person , go through immigration/customs , go to your bus and head for the resort getting out , a different story make sure you have 2 hours or more during the busy times little air - conditioning , lots of people i wo not bore you with details , but this was a horror story we will not be back to this resort and probably not to the dr 
nice resort , but not good in food at all if this is not going to be your first time trip to punta cana your expectation will be deferent our first experience two years ago was with grand palladium spa  resort which was excellent in everything , cleanness  food , day  night entertainment but our second time trip to d bahia , on the positive side , is very nice  clean resort with friendly hard working staff , but on the food side , i ca not give a positive rate to it it has 8 restaurants but all of them are pretty the same , it was not the mater of taste that much , our problem was the freshness of food which we both ( my husband  i ) had concern about it you got to watch out what you pick to eat the entertainment was ok too , i am not giveing it a wow factor over all it 's a family resort with lots of kids , not recommended if you are looking for a place to relax for us was ok because we had a 15 months old baby with us , which sort of made a busy vacation for us rather having a relaxing time going after a baby all the time is not easy , better off to wait another couple of years 
puna cana equals puka kaka do not get me wrong , the place and the staff were simply great room , great beach , super facility while sitting at the pool bar i stuck up a conversation with a couple from chicago they informed me that 10 of the 14 they were traveling with were sick in there rooms from the food i kind of shrugged it off and had another beer ate drank and had a blast for two days , then my fiance became ill and could not leave the room lucky the bathroom was really plush , if you get my drift we came home after four days , then i got it on the fifth day i am italian with an iron stomach and the puka - kaka got me too advice bring plenty of drugs and build up your immune system before going to punta cana it is a shame such a beautiful place can only be enjoyed if you really watch what you eat no bugs , not the external kind which we were prepared for and never got one bite the internal ones really gave us a run for our money , tough to get a tan when you are talking to the porcelain man got to run , or should i make that plural 
mostly good but some problems i have read so many of these reviews prior to my trip that i feel somewhat compelled to write one myself first of all , i was impressed right from the time of my arrival catching the bus at the airport was really easy and we were checked in right on the bus unfortunately , because we had an early arrival ( we were at the hotel by 11 am ) we needed to wait until 3 pm in order to check in since we already had received our bracelets on the bus we were able to eat , swim and access any of the bars when we arrived but before we could access our room you should pack a bathing suit and sun screen in your carry on bag as you will not be able to access the contents of your suitcase until you get to your room speaking of sunscreen - pack a lot my husband and i went through 3 bottles in a week - they sell it at the resort for $20 us a bottle the sun is extremely strong and you 'll need lots of protection the rooms were fine , better to be on the 2nd or 3rd floor as there is more privacy we had to switch rooms halfway through the trip as some one who moved in next door was a heavy smoker and the smoke goes through the vents our room was engulfed in cigarette smoke every time they lit up , and was so bad that it actually woke us in the middle of the night if you are a non - smoker , there is very little escape in this resort without exaggeration , 80-90% of the guests were smokers and smoking is permitted everywhere people were smoking in the restaurants , on the trolley , every in the pool i found this to be the worst part of the trip most of the guests were spanish speaking and they clearly smoke a lot more than canadians speaking of spanish - you may want to brush up on some basic soanish phrases as you will find it challenging to communicate without it food was not great the french and garden grill restaurants were great the seafood restaurant was horrible - i took one bite of my lobster and had to leave , it was putrid the japanese restaurant was also pretty bad but was great for meeting people the buffet was alright but we got sick of it pretty quick it was pretty much the same food day in and day out there are no places to get a snack ie chips , crackers etc while there and i wished we had packed some if you are hungry at 4 pm your can have pizza or chicken - both of which you will be sick of - pack some snacks - you 'll thank me for it bring lots of $1 bills to tip - you 'll be happy you did the service is amazing if you tip - we got lovely decorations in our room , bubble baths drawn for us etc and our fridge was full of the specific drinks we requested also if you tip the waitresses at the lobby bar ( which is the best bar - they make the best drinks ) they will be like glue to you , always refilling your drink order i do not think we would go back , but for the price , it was a great vacation 
but food not so great we stayed at this resort on the puna cana side from 6/9-6/16 in the diamond club there were 14 people in our group (2 yrs -60 yrs ) everyone in my family thought the resort was beautiful , the lobby was grand compare to other resort we saw when dropping people of off from the airport even the paradisus lobby was by far no comparison to this one eventhough it cost more we did consider staying there prior to finding out about the gran bahia principe so glad i did not booked there airport : the process was quick and efficient , just pay $10 for a tourist card , after getting our bags we were whisk off and transfer immediately to our resort , it took about 40 mins since we had to made 3 prior stop to drop off others the return was a different story , it was chaos on the weekend , the line was super long and hot and it took forever to check - inhotel  rooms : beautiful ground it was breathtaking you wo not be disappointed the room was very spacious and nicely layout the king bed is truly a king compare with other resort i 've stayed in the past if you travel with young kids one can sleep on the sofa bed the maid will come and put sheet and pillow down for them they have crib for really little one , i requested for my 2yrs old it is a graco portable crib , which works out great since my little one naps in it at home so it was like sleeping at home for her the maid did a great job cleaning our room early everyday , we left her $2-3 tip each day , we got plenty of everything ( water , shampoo , towels , pillows ) beach/pools : the beach is gorgeous clean and not strong wave so it was perfect to swim in we did not have any problem reserving loungers at the beach for our big group i saw a lot of empty palapas if you have 2 or 4 in your group you should not have any problems finding shade at any time during the day food/drinks : i will start out with the drinks the fruit cocktails were sooo sweet it was like drinking syrup like the other reviews only the lobby bar makes decent cocktails the pool/beach bar was a hit or miss depending on what you ordered and the bartender do not even bother ordering a drink in there it was the worst do try the frozen bahia principe , it is pretty good but ask for it frozen otherwise they will serve it on the rocks a word on bartenders some were really nice especially the beach and pool ones but the ones in the theater and lobby do work for tips , if they see a buck in someone hand they will run over to serve them first everyone in our group do tip when we order drinks but we give it after if the service is good you should not have to buy service same for restaurants , our group would leave $20 - 25 in tip for the waiter if the service is great , the look on their face when receiving the $$ is priceless we got 4 ala carte so we booked 2 french , 1 seafood  1 japanese , here is my take on the restaurants : french : food was not good , portion was quite small and the service was extremely slow 5 hrs for us to eat in there , i had the surf and turf ( lobster  steak ) , the steak was overcooked so it was really tough  the lobster was mushy because it was dead for sometime prior to cooking my whole family grew up on the coast eating seafood all our lives so we knew right off that it was not edible it does not matter what part of the world the lobster is from , if it 's mushy do not eat it or you can get really sick shellfish should not taste like that we tried to book other restaurant after our first dinner here but was not able to so we were stuck eating here twice one over puna cana and one over the bavaro side the service was not any better , everyone in my family did ordered something different hoping that it would be better but it still was not good seafood : if you are a seafood lover , do book this restaurant it has an appetizer bar with lots of good selection such as ( calamari , fish ceviche , seasoned shrimps , squids ) we all had the lobster special it was really good the lobsters tasted like it should do ask for the garlic butter to dip with you will leave very full and satisfied the service here was also good japanese : it was okay if you 're looking for a different dining experience , we had a big group so they cooked everything for us ( beef , chicken , shrimps ) the shrimps were really small and previously frozen the service was super fast we were at the hibachi table less than an hr and was whisk away to another table to have dessert buffet : our group had to eat dinner buffet 3 consecutive nights , it does get repetitive and the food was not good i 've stayed at other ai in mexico and the food was much much better even at the buffet excursions : our family did the caribbean festival which was a lot of fun , it was a 4-5 hrs trip on a catamaran which we snorkel and party the do have dominican dancers to entertain you during the boat ride it cost $78/adult and half price for kids under 12 my 6yrs old loved it they do require life jacket to be worn during snorkeling or else you have to sign a waiver if you do not want to wear one my husband , 6yrs old and 8 other family members did the atv crazy wheels (4 wheeler ) they all had a blast they got to drive the vehicle for almost 3 hrs going through town , river , beach , coco plantation , swiming in a cave they video tape the whole excursion with everyone in it and sell it afterward for $35, my husband bought it since there were 10 of them in the group if you go in a big group it is worth buying it is $90 for single rider and double rider are $60, they do have helmets for everyone ( they do not allow you to ride without a helmet ) and my husband said all the vehicle was in great condition i do not know where the other reviewer booked their atv excursion that allow them to ride without a helmet and also for only $40 maybe you get what you pay for do book your excursions in the tour operators office for a more organized and safer excursions , the scuba caribe sales people will go around to get you to book with them , they had a 2hrs snorkeling tour for only $28, they take you out on a small boat , it did not seem like a safe and quality kind of snorkeling trip so we all opted for the $78 snorkeling trip , glad we did it was worth it overall , the resort and beach is beautiful but the food was a little disappointing to us my husband and i have traveled the world and we are by far not picky eater because we love trying new food but here we have to rate the food as below average if they could improve on the food , this resort would be top notch keep in mind when booking here , if you come for the beautiful scenery , resort  beach you will not be disappointed but if you come expecting culinary cuisine 
would not recommend we just visited the hotel in june for a wedding our experience with most of the visit was not at all pleasant starting with our arrival as has been mentioned in the other reviews , this resort is huge when we got to the hotel , we found that our room ( # 40112) was the farthest away on the back part of the resort , far from the beach and having a child with us , we wanted a room close to the pool and beach the number 40 block of rooms are approx 200 yards from the lobby , which you have to walk , and then the trolley is another 75-100 yards from the lobby we asked to be upgraded near the beach and had to pay more but they kept telling us because we upgraded we now had certain restrictions and would not be allowed to go to one of the pools and one of the restaurants i still don?? understand that one? and paid more money so why are there now more restrictions well after spending the better part of the first day trying to get a decent arrangement , we finally were upgraded the rooms were fine but we found a cockroach crawling in my husband?? bathroom bag hanging on the bathroom hook location seemed ok the beach was great - - - no seaweed and clear the sand was white and soft and didn?? get too hot cleanliness : the maids cleaned and made our beds twice a day but my perfume , a $70 bottle went missing the last day , the maid did not show up to clean our rooms i have never in my entire life eaten such horrible food the buffet was terrible the food in general was overcooked the shrimp was so overcooked that they actually tasted like pork rinds and the filet mignon was like eating cardboard and while eating at the garden grill , a mouse crawled by us the drinks were horrible also , i asked for a mojito and the leaves were brown and old the strawberry ice cream tasted like chewing gum most of the desserts were not good this is one resort that i will never go back to and would not recommend 
relaxing trip - my take i visited the dominican on june 5-11 with my boyfriend overall the place is very well kept and the service it great here are my opinions on the various points room - awesome spacious - cleaned and stocked daily was on the first floor and really have no bug complaints hotel grounds - beautiful as everyone says extremely well kept and groomed resort is big but not as enormous as the boards make it out to be we were all the way in the premiere section ( furthest from the beach ) 5 city blocks to the beach - a nice walk but , yes the trams run very frequently for those who wish to not walk on vacation beach - beautiful there is some seaweed but really not bothersome had a few days of waves and a few calm days and both were great really enjoyed watching all the activities on the beach that the resort does like the constant volleyball action or beach aerobics still cant get that song out of my head pools - nice very warm water didnt spend really any time here as we go the caribbean for the beach chair problem - was actually not at all a problem we slept in every day till 10:00am and got to the beach by 1030-11 and never had a problem there were plenty of chairs and shade as the beach has a ton of gorgeous palm trees that provide ample shade the pools didnt look bad either i actually did see signs posted about not saving chairs know this has been a problem for others but really at this time it was a breeze drinks - they were alright had a few drinks that were not terrible but by the end i was sick of them think this is an area they could do better service - very accommodating all the help seemed to go out of the way to help you most spoke english or understood enough to know what you were saying aside for one or two servers in the bavaro lobby bar , found all the employees very nice food - i am not a picky eater and generally like to try new things and eat almost all foods i have to say though this was the big area of lacking it was not so much of a taste issue but more of a freshness issue the food just was not fresh it was very evident as both my traveling partner and i got pretty sick for a couple of the days we had only been drinking/ using bottled water so it was not from that also , felt the alla carte restaurants were somewhat of a rip off in that it was really only served your entree that your ordered the appetizers were still in a buffet style overall - the resort is beautiful and its a good value for a nice trip i would just be cautious with what you eat and drink 
very nice resort no complaints here just came back from bahia on june 9th and all i can say is this resort is huge do not get me wrong we ( wife and 3 son ) knew when we booked , but the size really surprised us no problem thou as there are trams every 1-2 minutes on with the review : flight - - we flew with sunwing and except a 1 5 hr delay , due to one of the flight attendance sickness everything was just great check in - - done on the bus on the way to the resort , once in about 1 hr wait for the room food - - buffet pretty good , always something to choose a la carte : french - - i liked it , wife and our son did not japanese - - very good italian - - very good grounds - - absolutely georgeous , amazing room - - very clean , big hmm a room : ) beach - - worth travelling for no words to describe it , must be seen stuff - - very friendly remember you are in dominican you make the effort , we did and it was very much appreciated overall - - very nice resort , great holiday , only complaint 
if you are going with your baby read this so after much homework and reading all of your reviews we choose to stay at the bahia principe did we love it no not really , but it also was not all that bad either check in was great we were diamond so we did not have to wait at the front desk to check in which was a bonus we travelled with our 14 month old daughter and requested a crib i e - mailed the resort 3 weeks before our holiday to put in my request and the best they did was a pack n play this is a 5* resort , so that was annoying after 3 days and about 10 different people we finally got a crib the rooms are nice , the property is gorgeous without a doubt the food , well for a 5* again sorry but you can do better than that i have stayed at 4* hotels that offered a better variety if you are staying for a week then you 'll be fine anything more thenthat good luck to you my daughter did not eat anything she did not like the food whatsoever i would strongly advise bringing enough food for at least1 meal a day if travelling with a baby most of the staff are really friendly and great , others are not somehit on me right in front of my husband which was just crazy we ate at the japanese resaurant which was great cafe de paris , also great and the mexican which was our favorite the restaurants are actually good , it is the buffet that is just okay i have travelled the world so my expectations were high , i wouldnever suggest that this is not a great place to go to it just is not a 5* hotel because we travelled with a baby we did not get a chance to see the shows make sure you re - apply your sunscreen often especially for your children , and bring bug spray oh and the drink are only good at the lobby bar 
beautiful resort - loved it just returned yesterday ( june 3rd ) there were 11 people travelling ( ages ranging from 3 years old to 56 years ) we had a great time the resort is very well maintained you will always see someone cutting grass , trimming trees , power washing the sidewalks , etc our maid was excellent - if we needed something , we just asked and we had right away our rooms were cleaned every day around 10:00 am , clean sheets every day , towels , stocked mini - bar ( tons of water , pepsi , diet pepsi , 7up , orange pop , beer ) , coffee , etc we needed extra towels the first day and they sent us about 20 towels the one thing that they do forget is face cloths but just ask , they do have our floor lamp was broken and the plug cover was coming out of the wall , the maids ' supervisor saw this and had maintenance come right away ( within 10 minutes ) to fix because she said it was dangerous for the little one we had no bugs in the rooms and no one in our travelling party got any type of bug bites at all food was very good - tons of selection at the buffets , same with the snack bars we did the gourmet a la carte ( not the best , slow service and not very much food ) , the seafood ( way too much food as the starters are a buffet style and then you get your main course afterwards ) and the japanese ( food was really good , tons of it and it is really different to have the chef cook right in front of you ) there is a snack bar in the pueblo principe that is open from 10:00 pm to 7:00 am - they offer hamburgers , cheeseburgers , chicken burgers , tuna , chicken , ham and cheese sandwiches and nachos and cheese - not bad , especially if you want food late at night ) evening entertainment in the theatre is more geared towards the kids which is fine ( lion king , circus , etc ) the entertainment in the pueblo principe was not all that great did not go in the casino but went a couple of times to the disco - was not bad - we made our own fun anyways so we did not care evening drinks are best at the lobby bar - great service beach is fantastic - very clean , warm water , tons of chairs ( never had to get up early to get chairs and we had 11 people ) the main beach pool is a little too warm but clean and there are activities going on there during the day size of the resort is not as bad as people say the trams run every 2 - 3 minutes ( at least 3 running at the same time ) but you can walk from the beach to the main lobby in about 10 minutes anyways very easy to find your way around just read the information that you are given and the large book in your room and you 'll be fine all in all - this was a fantastic resort and we can not wait to return at christmas time 
little disappointed i have been to cancun , riviera maya , cozumel , bahamas , grand cayman , puerto vallarta , hawaii , key west and miami i have stayed at sandals , palace resorts , riu resorts , westin , and other 4 or more star resorts this is not a 4 star resort , 3 at best upon checking in we waited in line for over 30 mins when we finally got to check in , the guy at the desk barely spoke english and was actually rude we made sure to upgrade to the golden club and were under the impression that most of the rooms in the golden club had at least a partial ocean view we were in a building pretty close to the beach but had a view of another building , as most of the buildings in this resort do there are only a few rooms that have even a partial ocean view as they carted us and our luggage across the massive resort i realized i had completely underestimated the size of it i knew it was big , but it is uncomfortably big i like to walk places but this was too much and it just was a real hassle we were 10 minutes late to our dinner reservation one night because a tram never came by and we finally had to start the trek to the front of the resort sometimes the trams come , sometimes they don?? the rude guy who checked us in said the safe was $5 a day , and we said ok meaning yes we need a safe well after we get to the room the safe didn?? work turns out he didn?? add the safe to the room key and we had to make the incredible trek to the front again this actually took an hour to get to the front , wait in line and get back to the room so now we are in our room and one lamp doesn?? work but even worse the tv remote did not work we tried changing the batteries but it was broken so we called the front desk well 2 days later we finally got a new remote after complaining at the front desk the remote is not that big of a deal i know , but this is to show the kind of service you will get from the front desk and management then the electricity started going out again it went out about 20 times over the course of our stay , usually at night , so it would mess up the alarm clock if we needed to wake up in the morning the beds are ok but the pillow are 2 inches thick the room is dark and doesn?? feel luxurious the bathroom is kind of nice with marble but the shower is open and water gets everywhere so then we venture out to the beach where your eyes will sting , not from the salt water but the blinding view of thongs on people who definitely should not be wearing them everywhere , and topless women you need to watch wear you walk on the beach because there is trash , cigg butts , etc the worst part of the whole beach experience is there is no sunset on this part of the beach it is normally my favorite part of going to the beach watching the sun set but the sun sets on the other end of the island the water and sand look beautiful though the pools are fine and warm but can get a little crowded , nothing special , no waterfalls , etc they have aerobics and other activities like bingo now and then make sure you wear bug repellant wherever you go i wore it and i still currently have 12 mosquito bites the pool bar is always hopping with people from canada , europe and south america , we only met 2 people from america on the whole trip the drinks are the lowest quality liquor but we found i drink we liked called amarita ( something like that ) the food is horrible and i couldn?? even eat it at the buffet and snack bars we ate at the japanese and gourmet restaurants and those were pretty good though make sure to book as soon as you get there because it was hard for us to even get a decent time until the last 2 nights the shows were cute at the theater but nothing special the casino is a little room where i didn?? see anyone winning the disco only played spanish music and after a while we couldn?? take it anymore the karaoke was one of the most fun things , but its only open for a few hours , 9-12 i think , not sure the shops in the pueblo will try to sell you 2 tiny silver earrings for $155 us we ended up getting them for $25 the last day we booked a horseback riding trip to h3 ranch through the tour desk at the resort they said the bus would pick us up at 4pm and we would get back to the hotel at 6:30pm 7pm latest we had an 8pm dinner reservation , so we thought it would work well the bus picked us up at 4:40pm and didn?? get us back until 8pm we had to get ready fast and we just went to dinner late everyone is on ??ominican time? which means if they say 15 minutes , it means 40 horseback riding was one of the best parts of the trip once we got there , it was beautiful the horses were wonderful and macao beach where we rode was breathtaking it also gave us a glimpse into the dominican country leaving the hotel the bell boy did not get to our room for 45 minutes and he said it would take 10, so make sure to give your self extra dominican time overall it was a little bit disappointing trip the service of the waiters/bartenders was good ( probably because of tips ) but the front desk and management needs a lot of work plus the quality of the hotel is not luxury , it is mid - range , like a 3 star resort we walked down the beach to majestic colonial ( next door ) and it seemed much better i would go there instead if you are going to punta cana 
perfect for couples food/water well we just got back from a beautiful amazing week @grand bavaro principe here it is in a nutshell since i now have 200 emails waiting for me at work beach - crystal clear turquois waters , white sugar sand chairs were plentiful handful of topless women ( not offensive though ) lots of activities available , but many of them are not inclusive went scuba/snorkleing for $65 you can bargain but they dont go down too much worth it though we spent a lot of time at the beach after dinner as well water was cooler at night but laying on a long chair under the stars with no sounds other than waves crashing was priceless grounds - immaculate first thing in the morning until last thing in the evening , you will always see the workers painting or cleaning or gardening , the maintenance is kept to a t ive read many reviews talking about how large the resort is - - which is true , however the little trams running until 3am make getting anywhere on the resort less than a 3 minute ride away we had a very large group as well and always managed to find eachother w out a problem people - it 's been a slap in the face coming back to the states and remembering how people normally act everyone who works at this resort smiles and says ola like you 're their best friend you feel like they truly are family i became friends with a few people who worked there and when i left i was actually sad to say goodbye friendliness and warmth like you have never expeirenced before most of the guests at the hotel are either southamerican or european while spanish will certainly help you a ton , you should be able to get by just fine w the english tongue food - highly reccomend booking at the restaurants since i only got to eat at one ( le gourmet ) the buffet hours are super convenient and its easier than going to the restarants but the food is simply better at the restaurants buffets were good too w a huge selection , but dont expect american tasting food even if its an american entree being served i enjoyed it but some of my party found the food just okay and sometimes even bad my only caution is that , be it from water or food , many of our group returned home with stomach illnesses ( diareah and vomiting ) the food is the only thing we can link it to , though not everyone who ate it got sick just be sure to be cautious i brushed my teeth w the sink water while a lot of ppl used bottle bottle is probably your best bet just in case i had my boyfriend and cousin both wind up in the er w iv 's so be careful drinks - sort of on the weak side when you order all the fun and fruity ones , i reccomend ordering a separate shot of rum on the side and adding it to your drink they will gladly give it to you activities - since its an all inclusive resort , everything is done on grounds to get a little adventure in your trip i highly reccomend booking something off - grounds activities like the safari we took that brought us doonbuggy riding , cave swimming , and horseback riding that was probably the best part of the entire trip a bus picked us up and took us through the rural villages of the dr where you really get to see the real deal and we got to do so many fun adventures that really get you dirty it was probably the most memorable part of it all oh , and don t forget to hit up the nightclub congas we had fun dancing to both latin and american dance music until 2am shows - average but more just a place to sit down and relax and have drinks while performances are going on in the background casino is very small also , but has blackjack , roulet slots overall - - excellent vacation from start to finish my parents who said that apple was terrible and made getting home a nightmare others who met us down there had no problems so who knows only negatives were the post - trip travelers sickness and things didnt always start on time ( my sister was married there w the judge an hour late leaving us all in 100 degree temps outside waiting ) another caution - - two members of our party had their cell phones stolen out of their room so get the safety deposit box it is offered byt i believe you need to pay a small fee for it totally worth it just becareful too because there were a couple times when i had to get back into my room and left my key at the pool and the maids let me in w out a question showed how easy it was for anyone to get in your room and carry cash w you for tips - not pesos , they will exchange it for you and give you pesos as well the on site atm 's give out pesos too , but i found iti a lot easier to keep track of cash using american dollars if you are use to them they take them just as well as pesos 
wayyyyy to big for me our visit was in may we returned from a one week holiday on may 20/07 the reason for the trip was my niece 's wedding we had hesitated booking for a long time due to the malaria information , flight inconveniences etc my family and i have traveled to mexico all inclusive resorts extensively ( probably 20 x 's in the last 8 years we love the amenities these resorts offer we were hesitant to travel to the dominican the price was high , and other problems that i mentioned i really did not want to miss my niece 's wedding so we booked the flights offered were all horrible with an 8 hour lay over in either toronto or montreal we traveled for 2 days to get there , and2 days to get home ( have been spoiled by all the direct flights to mexico ) there was no direct flights upon arriving , the resort is beautiful it is what i would expect from a 5 star resort however , the resort falls short in many areas the rooms are missing the small touches robes , slippers the mini bar was only restocked every other day , if you wanted more , you paid for it all 5 star resorts i have stayed at have had 24 hour room service the staff were not as friendly as mexico the food was onlyaverage , nothing special could not have stayed for 2 weeks the biggest drawback for this resort it was wayyyy to big forme if you happened to be down at the beach , and wanted somethingfrom your room , it was so far to go i did not like the mini tram/buses that took you everywhere blowing their diesel fumes could not see the ocean from any room i love ocean front rooms some good things though i was worried about mosquitoes only had about 12 bites most from one night so not too bad the resort was clean and i would not have missed my niece 's wedding for anything and we were all having similar thoughts on the resort we had a nice time , have had better elsewhere we would definitely not go back , but glad we have been do not like the malaria pills taking them ) mexico here we come 
relaxed and feeling fine we stayed at the gran bahia principe from april 23 - april 30 my husband and i and my parents we had a nice flight down and when we arrived the punta cana airport looked so beautiful we booked club diamond through sunquest when we arrived at the airport you are given a number and directed to get on the bus when we arrived at the club diamond bus there was a card with our names on it and my parents name on it , but when we got on the bus everyone was given an envelope ( a club diamond check in envelope ) - we had no envelope with our name on it i was then asked to show the hotel voucher ( which is behind your flight tickets ) unfortunately it said premier let this be a warning to all first time travellers - check every detail of your tickets , i had no idea there was a hotel voucher to be checked , i only checked our tickets for accuracy well , we were then told to get off the bus , remove our luggage and get on the premier bus even though i explained to the representative from the hotel ( she is there to meet you ) that it was obviously a typo and that i was positive we booked club diamond - we were demanded to leave the bus to cut the story short , we refused to leave the bus the hotel representative told us on the bus that we would have to check in to the premier section and figure it out the next day as we had no sunquest representative at the property to help us she sent two other people from the bus company to force us off the bus - we did not get off the bus all the way to the hotel we were very upset by our treatment and when we arrived at the gran bahia we could not even enjoy the welcome that they put out for you - dominican dancers and a welcome drink as soon as i got off the bus i saw our sunquest rep , i immediately went over to him and explained the problem and i demanded to call canada to speak to a sunquest rep in toronto and our travel agent he calmly said we do not need to call canada we will look after it from here - he made one call and determined that it was in fact a typo and we had definitely booked club diamond we arrived at 11:00 a and our rooms were not ready until 3:00 i went into the club diamond lounge to complain about the rep on the bus and spoke to her boss who gave each couple a bottle of champagne and fruit platter and an extra a la carte restaurant to eat at the restaurants - a la carte - we booked them as soon as we got there - next day - and they were booked , unless you wanted to eat dinner at 9:00 or 9:30 at night when we did get into a restaurant at 6:30 the restaurant was only half full the best in our view was the italian and the mediteranean we also enjoyed the beach barbeque and we ate lunch every day at the brazilian bbq the hamburgers are inedible the meat is pink and i met a fellow traveller who got sick on the hamburgers the fruit is always nice and the salad is good as well we found the property to be very well kept and clean the rooms are large the beds were very comfortable the people are very friendly the buffet was average you have to be careful what you choose to eat the beach is beautiful and we spent our days at the beach and then finished at the club diamond pool bar - the drinks are plentiful you do have to save your chairs both at the beach and the pool - they say you are not allowed , but everyone does it and if you do not you wo not have a spot we found the night life - the shows - started too late - 10:30 they should have two shows one for the crowd who gets up early and one show for the people who like to start their evening at 9:30 the shops in the square were great for souveniers all in all , once we got past our initial first day troubles , we all relaxed and had a great vacation since we do not travel that much , i would prefer next time to try somewhere else , perhaps mexico or aruba 
beautifull resort - april 23 to 30 april 23 to april 30resort is beautiful the resort is large but the tram runs from the beach to the front lobby almost every five minutes but it was only about a 10- minute walk we were booked on the punta cana side but were in building 64 on the bravaro side so we tended to use the lobby and buffet on that side even though the resort was large ? it was manageable and you really didn?? notice that there were many people there the grounds are beautiful and everything is so clean the beach was awesome although the water was a little rough we had great weather overall - you know it is hot when the workers are carrying umbrellas to keep the sun off a few rain showers and one day of rain ? hey , we were in bathing suites anyhow ? so it didn?? matter we were in the golden section in building 64 the room was nice and the air conditioning was great ? much appreciated after a long day in the sun large bathroom with big soaker tub , separate shower , separate toilet with frosted glass door - great water pressure and lots of hot water for the shower ? king size bed ( mattress was a little hard ) but not a major hardship room was always clean and we always had clean towels the maid service was great we enjoyed being close to the beach and pool a little jockeying for chairs and shade but that is to be expected the pool bars were good not a great selection of drinks but we are not drinkers so it was not a big deal to us ? just enjoyed getting a cold drink we ate breakfast at the main buffet and enjoyed the food we tried the breakfast buffet by the pool once but not enough selection at lunchtime , we ate at either the pool buffets ( not great but okay ) or we went to the main buffet no major complaints about the food - it was as we expected for a buffet for supper , we did five a - la - cartes japanese - excellent , garden grill another favourite ? great menu and a good cold/hot buffet - service was excellent at both gourmet and french were okay ? same food at both ? not a lot of selection ? service okay at french much better at the gourmet bbq was terrible and service was poor ? 9:00 reservation so maybe they just wanted us out of there supper at the main buffet was fine ? breads were fantastic ? many sweet breads desserts were good too reservations were hard to get and mostly late at night 8:00 to 9:00 we usually arrive 30-45 minutes early and got seated in 15 minutes or so ? restaurants were always half full the wines were a hit and miss some of the white wines at the restaurants were okay others were like vinegar staff were helpful ? a little problem with english but otherwise okay found the maids and ground staff was friendly and always greeted you waiters and waitresses , bar staff all friendly oddity was that for some of the staff the better their english the poorer the service having said that , we had some dealing with some of the shift managers and we had some good laughs ? juan in particular entertainment was as expected ? it is not las vegas they really work hard and try their best the shows were good we saw the lion king and it was well - done ? think high school production they even included the kids from the kids club , which was a nice touch we went to the karaoke bar and had a good laugh also , went to the disco one night just for the experience saw one show at the pueblo with a bit more adult content - it was a good laugh with audience participation we took a walk to the market on the beach be sure to haggle with the vendors ta advised use to pay ? of what they ask we checked the prices at the pueblo before hand to get an idea of the prices bottom line ? the trip is what you make it ? and we had a great time 
beautiful resort , poor service , bad food first , a warning to parents traveling with two children : there are no rollaway beds available in this resort ( first time in my many times in the caribbean all - inclusives ) so you have two choices - - either sharing a king - size bed with one of your kids , or getting a room with two full - size beds , each of them too small to accommodate two full - size adults the resort is large , well - maintained with nice pools and beautiful beach bartenders are cheerful , skilled , and drinks are plentiful tips are appreciated , but not necessary mini club for kids is apparently a lot of fun some of the nightly shows they put together ( michael jackson , circus ) are almost professional during our stay , guests were mostly canadian , french , a few italians , and very few americans size of the resort is not a problem at all , there is all - day transportation from the main lobby to the beach with stops throughout the resort the food ranges from semi - decent ( italian restaurant ) to below - average ( french ) to simply inedible ( mexican ) in the buffet we could only handle pasta , eggs , breads and fruits and vegetables everything else was either bland , or greasy , or whole - fried service in all a la carte restaurants was just ok , but in the buffet it was pretty terrible due to the fact that no one ( i mean no one ) speaks any ( i mean any if you , god forbid , turn away from your half - eaten meal for a split second , the plate will disappear from your table the generic wine was horrendous with your eyes closed you wo not be able to tell the red from the white , because they both smelled and tasted like vinegar room service was pretty bad i gave the woman $5 us daily and she still would not clean the room till late afternoon , so if we wanted to return to our room before 3pm , we could not it was impossible to get extra towels , or an extra bottle of water a few times we could not get any fresh towels until very late afternoon , despite calls to the front desk the worst of all are the reception desk people arrogant , rude and inept upon arrival we had to wait 3 hours ( from 2 pm to 5 pm ) to get a room , despite a rather large tip they would not crack a smile , or thank you one night i actually witnessed them mocking a tipsy female guest who lost her hotel bracelet requests and phone calls are answered with such impoliteness , that you would think twice before asking them a question they call it , as one of the front desk managers told me , ??eeping the integrity??? you say , it 's all minor stuff , do not be petty , enjoy your vacation , but at the end of the day little things like these prevent your from calling your stay in gran bahia principe a ??reat vacation? 
great place and people - dissappointing food date : april 21-28very beautiful and clean resort we travelled with 11 people and had 4 rooms in building #1 in the golden section it was great being closest to the beach and pool there also was an indoor and outdoor restaurant close by so that we did not need to travel to the main lobby area the resort is huge but the trams come every 2-3 mins - even at 2:00 a in the morning they are always cleaning and maintaining the resort inside and out and the staff are most friendly the big dissappointment was the food this was our 4th all inclusive (2- dr and 2- mex ) we have never experienced such poor a la carte dining anywhere i can say that we never experienced a single poor a la carte at any of the other 3 resorts - here we had 4 bad experiences do not do the lobster beach bbq - as others have mentioned it is not so good without the lobster i felt so bad for the wedding party beside us who obviously were looking forward to a nice meal the groom was very distraught - do not blame him the bbq steak was like chewing on your boot the japanese was probably our best outing however if you are looking for authentic taste and presentation - you 'll be disappointed - i would give it a 5 out of 10 we thought the next night at the italian restaurant would restore our pallet we arrived and found 2 people from 2 separate tables returning the food on their plate 1 from our table had to do the same finally came the steak house we arrived once again to have the table beside us very upset with their meals the 7 of us who ordered the rib steak could not cut the meat bring a steak knife 2 from our group ordered the tenderloin - it was the only meat that was edible i have never experienced such poor quality of food for a la cartes i have never witnessed so many people returning food it 's too bad because the place really is beatiful it is great for families kids and even singles our 19 year old lived every night at the disco - meeting girls every night - he had a blast with some effort on the a la carte dining this could be a 5 star facility however i would rate it a 31/2 or 4 max the beaches are definetly 5 star even better than when we stayed further down the beach at the paradisus you ca not even compare the dining at the 2 facilities tim - toronto canada 
huge resort - but veryyy well kept we just got back from the bahia our weather was so so which was a disspointment we had sun and rain almost every dayfirst and foremost this hotel is enormous i there are many villas that you have to take a trolley to get to we upgraded to golden which i highly recomment for a few extra $ by being a golden member , we were closest to the beach , had our beach towels replaced every day by the staff , two bottles of water and our own reception area to make reservations , checkout , etc if you speak english , please brush up on your spanish because the staff speak littler english we especially had a problem when asking quesitons on how to use our safe , and transportation to the airport our room was umbelievable very spacious ( golden room ) jacuzzi , shower , big vanity we loved our room food - the food was decent , buffets were geared towards european but being from america , we were able to make due the breakfast was great , lunch everything is the same no matter where you ate that was a negative you couldnt go anywhere diffrent for lunch i am not a fan of eating hot food when i am in the sun all day so i felt there wasnt enough variety we did ala carte dinners all week the restaurants were very good we ate at four places : japanese , steak , italian , and mexican mexican was our favorite the italian was good too drinks - as stated in another review , the drinks were extremely watered down you have to tell the bartenders more alchohal the mexican restaurant had the best margaritas beach - excellentbeach pool - very good there are lots of pools we stayed at the one closest to the beach we didnt have a problem finding chairsnightlife - there are theme shows everything this huge hotel has its own village of shops during the day and entertainment late at night the casino is not worth visiting and the disco was a great time the only negative is , it opens at midnight and closes at 2 the disco has its own dancers to dance with guests we felt like were at the resort in the movie dirty dancing positives - rooms , a la carte dinners , pool , beach , breakfast buffetnegatives - way too big , confusing , we didnt know there were two lobbies until day two of our vacation - the lobbies are identical mirror images of eachother , lunch buffet 
great , great , great just returned from a 4 day stay at the gran bahia principe i have to personally thank everyone who took the time to post reviews to this site i read hundreds of them before leaving and felt well prepared and knew what to expect once i got there for the most part , everything that i 'd read was accurate the resort is huge ( i ca not tell you the number of times i got lost or thought i was on the punta cana side and was actually on the bravo side ) i flew from baltimore on usa 3000 the flight was wonderful i 'd actually booked my air fare and hotel reservations seperately and received a better deal than i would have had i booked a package the plane was filled with travelers who 'd book through apple vacation because i did not do a package , i had to arrange and pay for transportation to and from the airport and resort i found a company online , s silva , and paid $90 round trip for the service when we landed in punta cana , went through customs and retrieved our bags , someone from the transportation company was there waiting with a sign to take us to the resort all i had to do was give him my printed confirmation ( more about this later ) the ride to the resort was exactly 30 minutes and uneventful ( probably the most intriguing thing was seeing a soldier on the side of the road with a m16 rifle ) we arrived at the resort and were informed that we 'd be given vip status i was not sure what that meant but was appreciative we were assigned to villa 7, room 7302, which was fairly close to the beach ( although to see the ocean , we had to stretch really far over our balcony and look to the left and in between the tops of the trees , we could see water the room was very nice and clean with towel scuptures and fresh flowers on the bed and the bathroom counter shortly after arriving , 2 gentlemen knocked on the door and delivered fruit and dessert trays , and bottles of champagne and rum someone else came while we were away and left a gift bag with golf shirts and hats in them i guess that 's what we got for being vip the air conditioner worked too well there was a white box by the front door that controlled the air and everything else electrical whenever you removed the card from the white box , everything shut off at night the room was too cold there was a refrigerator , which did not get very cold , stocked with 2 beers , 2 bottles of water , and 4 sodas on the second day , we left our housekeeper a note asking for a lot of water and beer along with $5 when we returned to the room , there were 12 beers and 6 bottles of water , a very clean room with clean towels and fresh flowers we had a different housekeeper after the second day , left her the same note with $5, she was not as generous as the first one we did not see any mosquitos and were not bitten we ate at the main buffets , the japanese and the french restaurants i 'm a very picky eater and i really enjoyed all of the food the main buffets ( on both sides ) did have a weird smell as others have noted the japanese restaurant was really , really good the french restaurant was just ok for me i ordered the sea bass with squid we had lunch one day at the mexican restaurant which was good there was paella which was good with the exception of the lobster in it it was very mushy we had breakfast one day at the outdoor restaurant on the beach i really had a hard time with people in their bathing suits ( with no cover - ups ) and bare chested hairy men in speedos at the buffet so , for me , the food was just ok we missed dinner one night because we 'd had a late lunch when we started to get hungry , everything was shutting down so i remembered the vip status thing and called for room service i was told that room service was not a part of our accommodations so much for vip status ( needless to say , we went to bed hungry ) the beach is beautiful you do have to reserve a prime spot early ( we got to the beach every morning around 6:30) however , there are chairs available mid - morning as well there were some topless women but it was not a big deal saw the michael jackson show which was really good spent some time in the casino and probably lost about $130 over 2 days not worth it but the weather was so bad i could not leave that 's another thing , it rained everyday we were there the first day for only about 1 hour , the second day , it rained for about 6 hours straight , a cold , hard , windy rain ( that 's when i got stuck in the casino ) then , a little bit for the next couple of days the weather report did say rain but i 've been to the carribean many times and know what that means so i really did not expect any boy was i wrong this time we were able to check out with no problem , however , i 'd remembered the night before that i was supposed to call the transportation company to confirm our pick - up time the person who met us at the airport did not return my print out so i had no information to call with i spoke with the person at the front desk about it , she sent me outside to the bell hops who sent me to guest services who sent me to where you book your tours who sent me back to guest services who sent me back to the front desk who sent me back to the bell hops it was a nightmare finally it did not matter that i 'd pre - paid to be picked up i just need to get to the airport i asked about catching a taxi and no one could tell me where to go after all of this and about 45 minutes of running around , i look and the van from s silva ( the transportation company ) is pulling up they had may name and everything and took me to the airport with no problem all - in - all , i had a wonderful vacation , i would go back in a heartbeat and highly recommend this resort 
awesome holiday well we just got back from staying at the bahia principe and loved the entire experience check in was so so as we did not know we had been upgraded to diamond club and could have checked in at the special area for diamond guests we were served a great fruit drink while we waited in line to check in and were very pleased with our room when we got there our room had been prepared with the air conditioning already one so it was a nice break from the heat the heat is hot hot hot plus humid so you will want many bathing suits and wraps if you do not own wraps do not fret as you can get any color you want down in the dominican at the local shops or in the flee market ( approx 30 min walk down the beach ) our room was way larger than any suite we have stayed in in canada and was kept very clean we were on the third floor and over looked one of the swimming pools we were a little ways from the beach and main pool but that was ok as we were on vacation and did not mind taking our time to get any where this resort is very large and they have trams for you to catch to every where you would want to go so you do not have to do lots of walking if you do not want to there are 3 different breakfast and lunch buffets you can eat at every day and then if you are diamond club or greater you can have 4 plus a la carte dinnes to get close to the beach you will have to upgrade through your travel agent and from what i understand this costs a lot more and i do not feel it is worth the upgrade for the few little extras you get we were entiled to 4 a la cartes but only ate at 3 as we did not want to be eating at 8-9 pm for our dinner they are difficult to get the times you want at the most popular ones so book when you get there we ate at the greek , japanese and french they were all good but i still prefered the buffet over the a la cartes as i like to sample a little ove everything the buffet is nver boring as it has a different menu every night you have domincan night , italian night ect there is always some of the same at the buffet so it should not be hard for even a picky eater to find something i have read that is does not taste like at home in some reviews , and it should not i would have been disapointed going to another country and everything tasted like at home remember you are in another country i loved almost all the soups served , my fav was pumpkin i had never had it before ) hubby is a good ole alberta boy and likes beef , chicken , pork and potatoes and he was more than satisfied every meal we went with no real expectations and were not disapointed we did see gechos ( spellling ) and two cock roches while we were there , again these creatures are like daddy long leg spiders here in alberta ( native creatures ) never near food or in our rooms though i found the resort tried hard to entertain their guest with pool games beach activites and in the main lobby the night entertainment was cute and we never did make it to the disco as it did not open till 12 am and we were exhausted by that time we did get up very early to get spots at the beach and if we could not find shade we hung out in the water when we got to hot from the sun chairs always seemed to open up so it was not as bad as i thought it was going to be the sea water is amazing , nice and warm and very salty so little ones might get tummy aches from drinking to much when you get out of the water you will find salt dried on you there are showers between the beach and pool to rinse the sand and salt off you the flea market is fun but i got tired of hearing cheapy cheapy come see my store if you are not good at bartaring or do not like to then do not go a hint , when they give you a price on their calculator you type in exactly half or less and go from there many of the merchants knew french german and english some had so so english but we could get by we loved the beaches except for the smokers that threw their buts all over the beach the hotle did a fairly good job at trying to rake every morning to clean it up but it would help if smokers could be considerate that was our biggest issue in the resort was the smoking you are able to smoke pretty much every where i just have gotten so use to it here in alberta where our buildings are smoke free so it was a little annoying that we had to keep moving to get out of the smokes way but tht is our problem not the resorts the workes in the resort may be there 12 + hours so do try to be friendly , tipping is not required to get good service but it sure can put a big smile on there faces to get a dollar or two every now and then we always left something for our maid but again it is not required we also took a bunch of old clothes and dollar store items to hand out we went on two tours , the caribbean snorkling and the bavaro runners would go back on the bavaro runners again but found the snorkling to be a wate of money and would just go from the guys offering it at the beach if i were to do it again our guid on the other tour let us hand out our gifts but not all do you can hand out near the end at the supermarket if your guid wont let you throught the trip i feel this was a great vacation and want to go back hope this helps you 
high expectations had a great time we traveled with our 2 children 13 and 11 just got back this morning my wife and i have been all over the carebean , and hawaii we had a great time and we make the best of every situation , we are not negative peaple , but the reviews we read were very helpful , and thats what i 'll try to do late fight arrived @ 7:30 arrived at the hotel @ 8:30 too late , you need daylight to try to get your bearings with this huge resort when we got off the plane you are mombed by dominica men trying to get your luggage , i have read previous reviews saying just to ingnore , we did that and saw an apple rep and he said juan will help you it wasnt an apple rep they were just helping the porters get some luggage crazy drive to the airport , we were golden members they said express check in , went to the lobby the said check in over there , no signs how are we supposed to know once we arrived everybody expected tips , i understand they are a poor country , but i am doing an all inclusive , i dont want to have to worry about carrying money around all the time , i will tip @ the end of the week if the service is good we found dominican men are very disrespectfull , rude , and are trashy if you dont tip you will hear them when you walk away , saying something about you if you take a tour , as we did a speedboat / snorkeling tour , the men will approach the bus gaucing @ your wife and 13 year old daughter shouting inapproapiate things , we dont need that the island is trash , dirty , nasty , smelly stay in the resort the resort people were even hitting on my daughter and wife , toatally innapropriate , and unproffesional the resort is 60% canadians , 30% french , and 10% us my impression is they do not like americans , and we did hear people say that obviously , the canadians are great , but the french people will not give you the time of day , they wont even look at you , but i guess thats expected in the morning i would get up about 6:30 to reserve chairs , then go back to sleep till 8:30 get everyone up , go to breakfast @ the ocean buffet dont get me wrong it is an excellent experience to share this time with my family , i am just giving you the facts the breakfast buffet , had undercooked sausage , bacon , slimy eggs we then went to the pool all day it was crowded but we didnt mind , had a great time you did see how the french people acted though they would let their kids run ramped without a care , if they are bothering anyone trying to relax , just as long they didnt have to deal with them one father let his child sit in the chair and screem @ the top of his lungs for 30 mins , instead of taking the child out of the pool area , he interuped everyones relaxation time the lunch buffet @ the pool was , red hamburgers , hotdogs , pizza with ketchup on them , and overcooked beef in gravey , every day dinners , were very good , even the buffets i was very concerned with all the reviews about getting sick , i have a very weak stomac , we do like to drink and i thought the ice in the drinks would be bad not true the water @ the restruarants and the ice is all filtrated , we even brushed our teeth with the tap water no problems my wife did 6 open water scuba dives , and my daughter did one , they had a great time then the day every traveler hates , the day of departcher after reading reviews everybody said no problem the first day i torn my tendon in my knee playing voleyball on the beach , so my mobility wasnt that good , this is not the place to be not being able to walk good we had a late fight out 9pm , so we were going to enjoy our last day the best we could again got up @ 6:30 reserved our chairs , @ 9am decided to get the check out process out of the way we were in villa 60 right by the beach , farthest away from the lobbies i waited for the tram didnt come after 15mins , so i decided to hobble , to the next tram stop , still no tram , i kept walking the property is approx 1 5 miles long , i finally got to the one lobby waiting in line , they said no you have to got to the other lobby , waiting in line she said you cant check out until we have your luggage and safe key , waited in line for a bell boy to drive me back get our luggage , came back waited in line @ the other lobby she said you need to check out @ the golden club , this is an hour and half later , so much for spending the last day @ the pool waited in line , then had to go to the tour dept to see when we had to be in the lobby to catch the bus spent the rest of the day @ the pool , left for the other lobby at 3pm , to get a shower for the flight home stayed @ the lobby bar till 5pm to get the bus while in the lobby we wanted to get some drinks , just to unwind , i approached the bar , and the bar tender said ,  what  i then started to lose patience knowing i am leaving the service was not there at all the drive back was similar to the drive to , buses passing on a one lane road , mopeds coming 6 inches to the bus to see who is in there , locals yelling and gaucing at the passengers inside the bus , trash on the side of the road long lines at the airport , hot , when checking in the airport rep doesnt speck english , i asked for special needs , being i can not walk , and he put my family all over the plane , screwing up everyones seats i know this review seems negative , but my family and i did have a great time , you just have to make the best out of every situation i think we are spoiled after going to st lucia is a very poor country as well but the people are respectful , clean , and appreciate tourism they earn their tips , they dont expect them 
returned from the gran bahia principe good overall , but we got sick i just returned from our vacation to the gran bahia principe punta cana i traveled with my husband , three children and parents my experience with this resort : we had a great flight , caught a coach bus at the punta cana airport and had a half hour ride to the resort the resort representative gave us an information packet with our room keys , wristbands and towel cards upon arrival , we were met with a red punch drink and dominican dancers in costume we tagged our luggage and left it with the bellboys our room was not yet ready , so we used the pool until about 3:00 p the gran bahia is two resorts in one they are mirror images of each other the bavaro to the left and the punta cana to the right ( we booked on the bavaro side , but were actually placed in a room on the punta cana side this really did not matter to us because they are identical ) if you are staying on the punta cana side , you must use the lobby bar , buffet restaurant and guest services on that side likewise with the bavaro side the rest of the bars , a la carte restaurants and facilities are for all guests to share the premier area of the resort is for guests who want to spend a little more money to have their own little resort within the larger resort we found the hotel reception staff to be a little stand - offish they seemed irritated when we asked them questions or tried to exchange money the rest of the staff : bartenders , waiters , housekeepers were very friendly and tried very hard to help even when they knew very little english our rooms were in buildings 5 and 7 for us this was a perfect location because we were close to the beach for those who are further from the beach , there is a trolley that runs continuously we would catch the trolley to get back to the lobby and buffet restaurant another reason we liked being within walking distance is that the pool restrooms were not kept very clean we opted to use the restrooms in our hotel rooms the rooms were large , clean and comfortable the bed linens and towels are not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel in the us , but were adequate housekeeping was great we left a tip each day and asked for extra water the beach here is absolutely breathtaking get out there early in the morning to get a good spot in the shade the hotel rules state that you 're not supposed to save lounge chairs , but this is not enforced it seemed that people were getting up earlier each morning my dad would usually go out around 6:30 a to save some chairs there is a company called scuba caribe who rents out the sailboats , windsurfers , kayaks and also the excursions and motorized sports that cost extra they are located in a little building on the beach i would suggest getting there first thing in the morning ( i think they open around 9:00) to reserve the activity you would like to do because they fill up fast their english is not great and there 's no rhyme or reason to the way they wait on people either you can be the next person in line and they will pass you over to help someone else this was a source of frustration for us we went on a two hour snorkel excursion to a nearby reef it was fun , but the guide drove us to the reef and basically said jump in there was no snorkeling/safety instruction that we 're used to getting on these types of excursions we went to the japanese , french and mediterranean restaurants the medditeranean was our favorite i know that a lot of guests favor the japanese , but it was not up to the standard of any japanese steakhouse i 've been to in the us the lobby buffet restaurant had the best variety you could eat breakfast and lunch at the seafood restaurant by the beach or lunch any of the beach snack bars , but the lobby restaurant had the biggest selection ( they will serve hotdogs , hamburgers and chicken at the beach snack bars ) the fruits are delicious , pineapple , mango , guava , passion fruit and watermelon at every meal they also serve some kind of seafood concoction with mussels , squid , etc and a pasta bar at dinner one thing they do well is dessert the desserts were excellent the meats were usually overcooked you will be served the same cut of pork , chicken , steak and fish in every restaurant , they 'll just put a little different spin on it not the quality we 're used to getting in a good restaurant here go to the lobby bar to get the best drinks we drank a lot of umbrella drinks , but they were not very strong because i never got a buzz and i 'm not a heavy drinker do not bother to wait in line at the swim up bar there 's a bar across the pool to the left that 's never busy there were two shows every night an earlier 9:45 show ( located in the lobby theatre ) and a later 11:30 show ( located in the pueblo pricipe theatre ) shows will be posted on a board outside of the theatre the michael jackson show was entertaining what is the pueblo principe the pueblo principe is a large courtyard located in the front of the resort here you will find the casino , disco , pool tables , shopping , a hamburger restaurant , bar and a stage beware of the vendors they will solicit you to purchase items from their carts if you 're brave enough , you can bargain with them things i wish i knew before i came : with a family of five , we went through a lot of sunscreen i had to buy two more tubes at the cost of $17 i also forgot my sunburn lotion and had to buy that too if you have children , bring one of those lycra swim shirts many of the children were wearing them and i wish i had them for my kids they got burned the first day even though they were wearing lots of sunscreen bring more cash , less traveler 's checks 
enjoyed the bahia we were a group of 8 that stayed a week overall the stay was good we had been in contact with the resort prior to our arrival and much to our surprize we received a free upgrade to the royal golden club this gave us 1 extra a la carte (4 instead of 3) , slippers and bathrobes and turn down service that would replace your beach towels when people say this resort is huge they are not kidding , many people used the tram service we would usually walk as with all the stops the tram has to make you do not actually save any time the resort is so big we left with the feeling that we did not get to see everything food - the food at the a la cartes we went to was fabulous we did the japanese , mexican , steakhouse and meditrianian ( sp ) service at these we great food at the buffet was very hit or miss there was nothing offered at the buffet that made you say boy that was really good but it filled the hole make sure the hot food is hot and cold food is cold , quite a few times i left food on my plate because it was ice cold and should have been hot beach - very nice , lots of seaweed this week , but the beach was kept clean waves were a lot of fun pool - lot of pools to chose from , all very clean not much activity going on at the pools i had read some reviews stating it was to loud and busy at the pools , i 'm not sure about that as we could barely hear the music and the only activity was people looking for chairs beach/pool chairs - its true , if you want a chair at the beach or pool in the shade you better reserve it before 7am i was up really early (5:45am ) one morning and went down to the beach to sit there and watch the sunrise there were people scrambling around in the dark reserving chairs actually it was quite comical as they were tripping over stuff and walking into other things rooms - very nice , king size bed , jacuzzi tub no problems here at all entertainment - surprizing very good , no it is not broadway but still very well put together we went to every show except the michael jackson one and thats because we had late dinner reservatations service - for the most part it was very good still some strange stuff goes on for example we went for breakfest one morning and when we were seated the lady asked if we would like coffee , after a quick yes we were off to the buffet to get our breakfest i am still waiting for that coffee little stuff like that happened a few times not sure why but not really a big deal i just asked someone else for a coffee and it was there shortly there after another example is if you throw your beach towels into the bathtub the turn down service should replace them everytime we did this all the turn down service did was hang them up but our friends in the very next room would do the same thing and get new towels again not a big deal we just traded them in at the pool the next day but strange service weather -2 full days of rain , what can you do , we made the best of it all in all a good vacation , bahia met all of our needs probably would not return though as there was nothing provided that made this resort stand out from any other al resort 
reserving chairs - - a big problem we stayed at the bahia principe from march 16th to the 23rd the place was beautiful , well - maintained and the service was excellent the white sand beach was gorgeous the food was wonderful and none of us got sick we tried the japanese , dominican , mediterranean and french restaurants and we were very impressed with all of them the resort wine was not the best but you could order from their wine list for an extra charge we found the resort too big my husband and i have been to many resorts which were much smaller and we never had a problem with beach and pool chairs at the bahia , i had to be at the beach by 6:30 every morning to save chairs under a palapa for our family (6 people ) i witnessed some guests paying staff in the afternoon to save chairs for them for the next day these guests would show up just before 11:00 a we also heard that some guests were putting towels on chairs at midnight how sad is that there were many beach chairs along the beach but far from the washrooms and beach bar for the hotel 's 4,000 guests , they should add more beach bars and washrooms for future vacations , we will definitely look into smaller all - inclusive clubs where you do not have to fight for resort chairs 
great facility and beach - however the gand bahia principe was generally a very nice resort with great facilities and beach however there were several incidents that made our visit less than enjoyable and thus my lower rating for overall experience first the cons our flight was cancelled and we arrived a day late even though  the hotel was notified thru gogo travel there seemed to be a snafu with our check in at the club golden reception area it  took about 20 mins even though we were the only people  checking in at approx 3:30 pm much computer checking for our room it appeared finally assigned villa 64-110 it was 2 dbl  beds , not the king requested and we were told we would get unpacked and headed to beach/pool came back and went to  take shower and discovered water leaking from above our  shower from what i assumed wwas the shower above contacted club golden to inform and they said thet would send someone went to dinner/drinks and returned to room late shower was not leaking ( anyone using unit above ) but wiped up what i thought was residual water on the floor next morning awoke and found puddle 2x4 ft on floor from  leaking shower also discovered no robes/slippers/room  service menu per club golden upgrade conatcted club golden again and informed that i wished to be moved to another room , this time with the king bed and amenities included in club golden moved to villa 23-104 around 4 pm when it was  available club golden said that they would comp the cost of the in room safe for our inconvience , just stop by the club golden reception office to collect the refund we set the safe and tested it once and all ok when we got ready to go to dinner and lock it , it would not work called club golden to report and  told a technician would be there in 5-10 mins 30 mins later we carried our stuff with us and went to dinner because no one  came stopped by club golden after dinner that same night to collect our refund , but was told that we would have to come back the next day after 10 am for this also checked on the status of safe repair and was told that we needed to be in the room when the tech was there call them when we get there and they will send a tech , 5-10 min arrival after call we made the 1st call at 8 pm from the room at 8:30 we made the 2nd call to inform no show at 9 pm called main reception and spoke to a manager ( ) who took info and said they would call right back at 9:30 called guest services to inform of all the above  and my desire to register a formal complaint with management i did not pay to stay in my room all night at this resort while  being told 5-10 mins , i had been more than patient up to this point at 9:45 the tech finally arrives and replaces the 4 aa  batteries that caused the whole problem , a 5 min fix on our 3rd day there we were called at 8:20 am telling us we needed to stop by and sign new papers for the safe , even though we had done this with our initial room good thing we were awake finally went to club golden office late that  afternoon and they did not know what we were talking about told to return the next morning again to resolve i 'm spending more time with club golden than anywhere 's else in the resort finally on the 4th morning we meet with juan in club golden office to resolve all this juan must be some kind of manager because he wears a golden yellow shirt to set him off the other employees he now tells me that i must present my passport so they can make a copy in order to refund my measley $20 dollars at this point i inform him and all in the office that i will not do this and this is the last  apearence i will make in this office i have spent way too much time in dealing with the club golden reps with little success little do i realize that i have to go to club golden to check out on my last day when i do there is a discrepency in my bar bill we had 1 scotch and 1 grand marnier that where not all inclusive the first check presented to me that night was for $2500 dominican which was an error and i did not sign the  correct amount was $510 dominican which i signed for of course at check out they wanted $3010 dominican one more time i was asked to come back in a little while after they went to check the issue out at the lobby bar we go to breakfast and return to find all is finally well and we are issued our all important check out voucher without this security will  permit you to collect your luggage and board the transferr transportation to the airport you must get up early ( before 8 am ) to place towels on chairs if you desire any shade during the day resort info says that this is prohibited , but not enforced we observed many reserved chairs not occupied from 8 - 12:30 pm and then the reservers would leave by 2 pm no consideration for others and these were not all americans as a lot of people are fond of blaming hard to make reservations for restuarants with many groups staying for 2 weeks at a time it was hard for us on our 5 day trip to get in anywhere unless you wanted to dine at 9-9:30 pm then there were still limited options we wound up only getting one while there now the pros - beautiful resort and generally well maintained great beach and water a little murky and choppy but still great very hardworking employees , make sure to take $100 worth of $1 bills and tip not needed but they deserve it buffets were good tried several things that i 've never had  before never got sick ate at the mediteranean one evening good food and service a nice change from buffet outstanding bartenders in punta cana lobby bar at night to alexis and juan please tip them well drink mamajuana , it will cure what ails you called liquid viagra by some we brought the makings home buy it at the airport after you clear inspection and carry on ( bottle with dry ingredients only ) 
we stayed at the grand bahia principe punta cana feb , 19-26th we were a group of 4 adults 40-45 years of age we enjoyed our stay thoroughly the resort is very well taken care of and comes as advertised as in most of these reviews we had ala carte at the japanese , french , and garden grill ( steak ) all were excellant with the japanese being my favorite the buffet had a good selection , but most of the items were repeated every night but , we never went away wanting more the rooms were well taken care of , and we never had any problems with the maid service resort and beach : this is a large resort and the shuttles are a plus to get around especially for handicap and older individuals we have stayed at several of other resorts over the last 15 years i rate this one as average and is inline with the 5 apple rating due to the services they offer it is also inline with the iberostar and a little better than the catalonia both of which we have stayed at the beach is very nice , but crowded it seems the trend in the dominican is to go to these super sized mega roomed resorts to this resorts credit , bahia does a great job of handling the operations needed to serve such a great deal of people also , the bar service was excellant at all areas poolsat all the pools expect to have alot of children running around it 's fine if that is what you are expecting also , it does seem that some parents let their parenting skills go on vacation also when at these resorts i guess my point is that if you want solitude then you most likely will not find it at the pools airportno problems here transfers were fast and easy all in all we had a great time we booked this vacation through [ - - ] for the price we paid it was worth dealing with some of the issues i discussed above though some people we met paid twice as much and that definitely would not have been worth it for the same price we would probably go back , but if i had a choice between this one and smaller similar resort i would go smaller if you have any questions please e - mail me 
great 4 a vacation not a wedding lets start out with saying the resort itself is beautiful , the servers are attentive and the food is excellent however the wedding coordinator was not very time oriented at first i wrote it off as a langauge barrier however my good friend and father in law ( who traveled with us ) speak very good fluent spanish and there were still way too many mix ups for me before we got to the resort i had attempted to get in touch with the wedding coordinator several times ( five to be exact ) by phone and email , i did not receive a response until four days before we left then when she finally sent me the options on where i could have my reception and the menus , i printed them for my fiance to look at the next day i receive an email stating that since i did not respond ( in that time one day ) she would have to book it where she had availabe when we got there our room was directly next to my father 's oh soo romantic so we switched our room however all of our gifts ' from the hotel went to the wrong room day after day the literature i was sent stated the would press the bride and grooms attire , did not happen there was no rehersal just a quick do this do that with a little map they gave me a choice of songs to walk down the asile , they played the wrong song so once we got there it was a little choatic we arrived at the reception where our dinner was supposed to be a the hostess kept informing us that we wer not on the list the cake served at the reception was only vanilla , when i ordered half vanilla and half chocolate okay fine so i drank a few more cocktails and then i was over it until i go to pick up my pictures and they were not ready and when we returned the said they lost them we eventually got the pictures but the dvd we ordered was not finished so we were leaving at 6 am the following morning the said it would be done at 9 pm that evening by 11 pm we finally received our $220 dvd that has to be reformatted on a different disc to play in a standard dvd player ( it will play on a computer if you own a cd rom ) and the icing on the cake it says john and mary which of course is not our names so i suggest you go on vacation there after you have the wedding somewhere else 
but resort too big my husband and i and his two sons 16  18 just returned on tuesday from a week at the gran bahia principe bavaro we had a wonderful time as it was the first time the kids had been on trip of this kind my husband and i are frequent travelers and wanted to share the all inclusive vacation experience with them after much research , reading many great reviews and our previous experience at the bahia principe akumal in the mayan riveria a couple of years ago , we decided upon this resort and anxiously awaited our departure date while on the bus to the resort staff attached our hotel id bracelets and gave us our room keys we were in the club diamond section ( block 31) and our room was located in very close proximity to the club diamond pool and restaurant we were very happy that we upgraded to the club diamond section , as we enjoyed the extras that it provided we were entited to 4 a la carte dinners but when we were booking the times on the first day we were offered an extra meal at the dominican restaurant this was a very nice touch and proved to be one of the better meals of the trip we very much enjoy the a la carte dining when we are on vacation and having a quiet relaxing meal i felt that the meals and food were ok , but they were nothing really special everything was very mass produced and we quite often felt rushed from one course to another also , we were limited to the number of dishes that could be ordered ie appetizer or soup but not both i am one who likes to try lots of different dishes when i am on vacation and value the availablity this is the first time that i have ever felt limited at an all inclusive resort that being said , our favourite meal was at the steakhouse the steaks were fabulous , cooked to perfection and melted in you mouth we also very much enjoyed having breakfast and lunch at the club diamond restaurant as the main buffet and main pool snack bar were always very busy the beach and the weather were both phenomenal we walked the beach a couple of mornings in each direction it is wonderful white sand and the water is so warm the week that we were there it was sunny and warm the entire week with the exception of one afternoon where it showered for a couple of hours our rooms were on the third floor of our building and were large and spacious the marble bathroom was gorgeous and we always had hot water for a shower the only thing that we found disappointing was the maid service our room was never cleaned before 3pm and most often it was not done until 5pm this was inconvienent for us as we very much enjoy getting and early start to the day and returning to our room later in the afternoon to get out of the sun and relax before dinner overall , the resort is an amazing property the lobby and lobby bar are beautiful the best drinks are at the lobby bar much attention has been paid to detail throughout the resort the grounds are so extensive and all very well kept , but the resort is massive it is a lot of walking to get from any one area to another the shuttle buses were always a welcome site , especially at the end of the day also with the size comes the number of rooms with in the three resorts that comprize the complex there are approx 1500 rooms and they are still building more it really felt as though you were in a small town my husband and i really learned on this trip that we prefer the smaller resorts and their more personalized attention to detail all in all , we had a wonderful time at this resort but are sad to say that we would not return , prefering to try another resort , perhaps the excellence or paradisus when we return to punta cana 
beautiful place , bring the pepto my wife and i stayed at the grand bahia principe from jan 20 to 26 let me start off by writing that we both have been to some beautiful places in the carribean ( st bart 's , anguilla etc ) and i think we can say the beach and weather at grand bahia is on par with these places the hotel consistes of well over a thousand rooms , over two thousand + guests and considering the size of this huge resort they have done a fine job with the construction of the resort and the landscaping is beautiful the staff are the highlight of the hotel always singing , dancing and very polite and respectful some advise though , be respectful and learn some simple words in spanish , we found it helped bring a smile to there face and they were warm to respond we heard all to often some guests saying i don t speak no spanish  or  what did you say only real complaint was the food after the third day we just could not enjoy it look 's better than it tastes a few more trips to the bathroom then normal and a little of the pink liquid ( pepto bismol ) helped 
please do not idnore this review i ignored several negative reviews , thinking of that saying you ca not please everyone all of the time , and that surely it could not be that bad , and decided to choose this resort because it is fairly new , and it looked beautiful well never again we were soon made to regret this decision i know this review is long , but please take the time to read it i wish i could warn everyone we travelled to punta cana with our 2 children , ages 7 and 4 on our first night there , someone ( hotel staff ) came into our room during the night while we were sleeping ( sometime between 11 pm and 8 am ) and left beach towels on our luggage i know this may be hard to believe , but it 's the absolute truth were supposed to be beach towels in the room when we arrived , and when we called down and said there were not any , we never thought they would bring them during the night this is so wrong , on so many different levels - privacy , security , safety i just could not believe that this happened - especially in light of what happened in mexico not too long ago when i went down to the club diamond desk to complained about this , a guest there said the same happened to them , but he heard the maid open the door and was shocked too we had used the bead - bolt on the door , but soon discovered that it too was activated by the entry card since there was no do not disturb card we could use on the door , we constantly felt on guard and could not relax in our own room we spoke with some other guests who said their maid walked into their room during the afternoon while they were lying on their bed did not even knock first this is obviously standard practice , especially since when i complained , no - one really seemed surprised the lady at registration said she was sorry and would tell the maid not to enter during that night i was totally flabbergasted as this is a serious issue and shows total disreguard for their guests the kids club at this hotel was well rated which we thought was great and would allow us to have some quiet time without the kids we soon discovered this would not happen the staff at the club did not speak english - ( actually throughout the entire resort , it was very difficult to communicate because no - one spoke english ) , and there was not much to do there in the club the kids were left to play on their own and the staff sat around and chatted there were no organized activities our 7 year old was happy enough playing nintendo , and basketball with another little boy who was there , but after 2 afternoons that got boring and he no longer wanted to go there our 4 year old walked around the room and very soon discovered there was nothing for her to do they had a couple of movies and that was all when i asked about crayons and colouring ( which i had to do through geatures ) , i was told they finished how is it , at a 5 star resort , they could not ensure they had basics supplies like crayons and paper on hand had i known , gee , i would have picked up a couple boxes at the dollar store i realize we were in their country , but considering tourism is so important to them , you 'd think they 'd want to speak some english when i say practically no one spoke english , trust me , i 'm not exaggerating despite the language barrier , and the kids club ( which we could have done without it anyway ) , the biggest and most significant issue we had was someone coming into our room during the middle of the night , while we were all sleeping , they were right at the foot of our bed we had no security in our room if one of the maids lost her key and someone found it , they would have complete access to the rooms the guests could do nothing , even at night there was no way to secure your door this still sends shivers down my back at the thought of my kids being there , and what could have happened , and the total lack of respect for their guests we can honestly say we will never go back to this resort which is sad , because the resort itself is beautiful , the grounds are very well kept , and the food was fantastic definitely the best food we 've had in the carribean , but definitely not worth the risk to us 
just okay my daughters and i just returned from this hotel where we stayed for five days i would not recommend this hotel mainly for one reason and that is that we have returned with mosquito bites all over us our room was infested with them and had to have our rooms fumigated we were kept up at night with them attacking us and had to sleep under the sheets i found the staff at times unfriendly and they did not understand much english i had to contact the bell desk three times to come and pick up our luggage but we ended up taking it ourselves to check out the food was okay and what saved this vacation for us was the beach it is absolutely beautiful but unfortunately , they were playing music non - stop , so if you wanted to have peace and quiet , you needed to bring ear plugs the pools were nice , but also music was everywhere 
will never go back i have returned from bahia principe on jan 19 2007 and will never travel here again resort was too busy , food was horrible , my husband and i were both sick with cramps , he is still sick and needed anti - biotics for his sickness our room had a leaky ceiling when the person above flushed the toilet raw meat in the restaurants , had to get up early to reserve a beach chair , the beach was so busy i felt like i was on the 401 highway , staff did not speak english and were rude , pool bathrooms always had a line up and 2 out of 4 toliets were functioning the whole week , i guess they have a toliet problem , after eating that food , anyone would drinks were not all inclusive , only their cheap brands , no baileys , no cognac , no bicardi rum , no whiskey i have travelled all the islands and have never experienced this the only thing that was good was the weather and you can go to so many other places for good weather the staff never looked happy , we had to say good morning or no one else would the entertaiment was boring , the night club was pathetic , and if you wanted to go to the casino , bring lots of money , the drinks are not included , how sad overall , my worst experience , will never go back and was happy to come home , this is no 5 star hotel , more like a 3 star 
need to complain just a little i spent new years , and the week following , here with my husband , mother and 3 grown kids it is a huge resort and we were glad the trolley ran as freqently as it does we found the food to be very good and were lucky to enjoy rooms in building #1 which was right at the pool/beach my kids had a great time in the evenings with kids their own age in the casino or karyoke bar for example the only complaint was about their check - in procedure it was the worst check - in as a golden club member we were supposed to get prefferred service howevere the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing and check in took us from 3pm to 4 we had to be a little aggressive after a while or face being ignored signing up for dinner was awul as well and we never got the times to eat we reqested in fact we ate at 10pm one night way too late we took our own bags to the room and back to the bus on check out my boys were in a different building and despite empty rooms around me there was no way they were going to move them and would give no reason why not either i guess i wonder what we got as a golden upgrade and wonder if it was worth it ( room close to beach was nice tho ) we really had a nice time but we decided to go somewhere else next vacation :0) 
my husband and i stayed at the gran bahia for two weeks over the christmas/new years holiday we have traveled extensively ( mexico , caribbean , hawaii , europe , cruises , usa , etc ) , but this was our first ( and probably last ) time to the dr the good : the room , buildings and grounds were very clean and well maintained ( except the pools ) , the weather was warm , and the wait staff and maid staff were pleasant not so good : the food - - from the cold burgers , hot dogs and fries at the beach grills to the buffets with bland , lukewarm food to the ala carte restaurants??he food at this resort was not up our standards for even a three star resort the bars opened late and closed early , typical bar brands were considered premium ( and cost extra ) , and the wine was undrinkable there were no snacks at the lobby bar ( if you were lucky and asked they would bring you some peanuts or olives the entertainment was so/so?? one - man band playing music that put you to sleep in the lobby bar , shows typical of all - inclusive resorts ( michael jackson , etc ) and a very small casino ( where you had to pay for drinks - - $3 for a small glass of coke ) the shops were expensive and had items you can buy in the states for less than half the price overall , we felt that this resort was at best a 4 star ( and we are being very generous ) we also agree totally with a prior reviewer who said , ??anagement at this hotel comes across as incredibly cheap and stingy? the hotel itself is also a disappointment trying to maximize their profits by being cheap in just about any area? believe them - - this is definitely true excursions : we did take a day trip with the bavaro runners and would recommend this trip we got to see the countryside , sugar cane fields , rice fields , ride horse on the beach , and the guide was excellent if you take this trip , i would recommend taking some items to hand out to the children ( they recommend you not give money ) i took pencils and stickers and wished i had brought more 
beautiful resort but 3 out of 6 ended up sick i have used trip advisor many times when researching a holiday and decided to post a review of my most recent trip to punta cana so that hopefully others can learn from my experience i travelled with 5 other people , ages 28-62 we stayed in the golden club section of the gran bahia principe from january 4th -11th the resort is huge as mentioned in other reviews but the carts made it very easy to get around the golden club was great as it was closer to the beach however our room faced the construction that is being done on the bavaro side the rooms themselves are beautiful huge soaker tub , king size bed , nice sitting area only complaint was slamming doors from neighbouring guests the waves at the beach were awesome we got boogie boards ( with a $20 us deposit ) and played in them almost every day we did notice that a lot of the meat in the buffets is not cooked enough one person in our group got very sick the second day from eating an undercooked hamburger at the snack bar even chicken does not seem to be totally cooked by the fourth day of our trip another person got sick with very bad stomach cramps and by the fifth day yet another in our group was sick with very bad stomach cramps not sure what caused this , hard to pinpoint when eating at buffets nightly shows are not really worth watching but we already knew that from past reviews all in all it was a wonderful holiday but be careful what you eat 
good but not great just returned from gran bahia principe , bavaro spent 2 weeks over christmas and new year nice hotel very impressive on arrive , lovely large rooms although we requested a high floor and got a ground floor stayed in diamond club section no explaination on check on what the different colour bands mean especially that you may have restrictions never mind spanish speaking staff 90% of the guests were french and we later found out this is a very cheap holiday if you come from canada unlike if you are coming from the uk the staff had very poor english which is expected although i do believe the reception and customer services in the diamond reception to be able to converse clearly , which they could not , if you want international guests unfortunately you need to provide the service most importantly if you pay any money absolutely must get a receipt , we paid $96usd in the diamond reception and when we went to check out they had no record of it even when we spoke to the lady we paid she conveniently could not remember and we ended up having to pay it again irrelevant of your band colour everyone and their uncle uses all of the pools event though they are not supposed to , so i would not bother paying the upgrade at 11pm everything closes only option is to go to pueblo principe , we went there on new years eve and there were young guests stealing bottles of champagne from behind the bar which was unneccessary as the drinks were free but made you wonder what else they might try to steal so we did not go back there again italian restaurant for breakfast was ok but dont ask for a cup of tea , it is totally alien to them , they are only ok with coffee and when you finally get yourself understood , even in spanish , you get a cup of hot water with no milk mexican was very disappointing , i love mexican , it had no atmosphere at all and only served beef fajitas and i dont eat beef the beach pools and the beach were like sardines in a can , it was very loud and if clubbing or playing bingo is your thing then you will love it we stayed at the diamond/hacienda pool that was much quieter but is supposed to be for those guests only but all guests were using it we did the helicopter flight it was excellent and dolphin island although you have to be quick to get anywhere near a dolphin dont go to manaty park it is awful and if you have young children dont go to soana island , it is a very long day and there is no shade on the speed boat and it is very bumpy too overall , i would not recommend this hotel based on my personal experience , the resort is too large so if you like the personal touch there is not one , the small buses need to be changed to electric or battery operated as they choke you with fumes if you can stay on long enough i would rate it as a 4 star and that is being generous 
wondering what it was people liked we tend to stay in 5- star hotels whenever possible , and thought the gran bahia would be acceptable ( and this understanding that carribean hotels are not of the same quality as north american or european properties ) problems were not major , but extremely flagrant considering that this property is marketed as a premium hotel with all amenities particuarly irksome was the accumulation of unpleasant things not one or two , but a countless number ( had a certain number of amenities been impressive , it would have made it easier to accept those things that were more bothersome upon arriving , we found out that a number of little things are not included ( of course , if you can afford to stay at the gran bahia , the cost is not necessarily an issue - but it is a matter of principle first , the hotel safe $31 usd per week , so there 's $62 within 2 minutes of check - in ( this is after having been charged $10 usd each to enter the dr , b/c the airport officials told everyone on our flight that the airline 's arrival forms were erroneous - it smelled like a sham , to be quite honest next among the unincluded - drinks that we consider ordinary jack daniels , tia maria , kahlua , canadian club while i can see paying for these at a 2-3 star property , it makes no sense at a 5- star hotel we 're not talking premium alcohol ( while we do not drink per se , the few libations we had were definitely on the yucky side meaning the drinks which are included - local alcohol - are far from good value for the price paid other issues , price - wise : if you lose a room key or your little plastic/rubber id bracelet , you get to pay for the luxury of receiving a new one ( need i say duh bottom line : management at this hotel comes across as incredibly cheap ( did i mention that the plastic keys they give out are really old , and need to be changed every 3-4 days or so , b/c they get demagnetized this stinginess is also apparent with things like towels , some of them being so old there are actual holes in them ( not just worn or threadbare - physical holes the hotel itself is also a disappointment a bunch of issues , in random order : 1) lobby : vast , but cold no warm colours , or anything that even hints at cozy 2) furniture ( wicker chairs and other to sit in , lobby and other areas , including rooms ) : not one single such piece was comfortable thin pillows , so much so that if you sat down too quickly , your butt would hit the undercarriage ( yes , ouch just horrible ( as an aside , there was little to do on the site , so sitting in the lobby and bar area after dinner would have been an option , but seating was too uncomfortable to remain there for long periods of time 3) outdoor walkways : made of painted cement , which was extremely slippery when wet ( it rained for shortish periods every so often , so we did a lot of slipping and sliding ) particularly dangerous for the elderly - we saw a few cases of near - falls , etc 4) grounds : no colour , mostly sparse coconut trees and smaller shrubs , all green the few flowers there were ( ordinary , not even as nice as what we plant in our gardens around the house ) were picked every day by the chamber maids , to scatter around the rooms workers would also cut the grass with weed - eaters ( whipper snippers ) , leaving numerous yellow areas where they lost control and cut the grass to the ground 5) reception desk : with the exception of one or two employees , most of the workers at the reception desk were highly blase , quasi - rude ( cracking a smile would have killed them , it seemed 6) pool : main swimming pool is littered ( glasses , plastic bags , etc ) and the water is too murky ( maybe not dirty , but bad enough that you see things in a haze ) there are two other smaller pools , but not large enough , and not equipped with enough chairs and , a good number of existing chairs were broken in the back , so you could not raise them to a sitting position 7) specialty restaurants : while service was good , the food was more than ordinary ( i should say that the best of the bunch was a restaurant called le gourmet ) we tried a total of 4, and only finished our meal in le gourmet - we barely ate in any of the others , and on one occasion , trekked off to the buffet afterwards , just to grab something before bedtime ( the food at the main buffet , in fact , was oftentimes better than that in the specialty restaurants ) 8) lack of wildlife ( all wildlife ) : while we knew we were not going on a safari , seeing more than 8-10 birds over a 2- week period would have been nice we saw : 2 pelicans , 3 white birds , 1 osprey , 2 parrots , a few greyish birds the site is fumigated for bugs , but this obviously chases away some of the local fauna ( the fact that there are few trees also does not help much , i 'm sure this was likely one of the most disappointing aspects of our stay , as we felt we could have been anywhere nothing on the site made it stand out , fauna - wise , as the dr ( the only roaming animals were caterpillars and on occasion , ants 9) dull , dull , dull : do not go to the dr unless you wish to do nothing bird in a gilded ( and not that well - gilded , to be truthful ) cage syndrome while the hotel does put on nightly shows , they are overly geared to children ( that is the only entertainment ) ( there is a casino , but that 's too funny to even describe - small building , perhaps 20 slot machines and 6 tables very shabby - looking and not a spot where one would be motivated to spend an entire evening 10) shopping area : there 's a small complex attached to the hotel most of the stores offer cheap souvenirs , most of them touting the hotel name ( some overpriced , some not ) while there is a wonderful jewellery store , harrisons ' , which offers magnificent pieces , these are unfortunately priced at about 30% -40% above their market value ( no incentive to purchase there ) in the center of this market area are local stalls where merchants ply their wares they are - every last one of them - extremely bothersome so much so that even though you may want to shop ( particularly given that there is nothing else to do at night ) , you will leave after 2 minutes plus , there is nothing for sale that is unique in any way ( cheap bracelets , wooden statuettes that all look the same , etc 11) water : you cannot drink any water from the faucet this even means you do not swallow - at all - when you brush your teeth you need to be very careful when eating , as we - as well as everyone we met - battled at least 2 days or more of intense stomach cramps and the ensuing ( it may have been either washed lettuce , ice cubes , anyone 's guess 12) food in general : while the food was not bad , everything was pretty much cooked or fried in oil ( lots and lots of oil ) steaks and other meats were also fried in ( i kid you not ) about 4-5 tablespoons of oil , on a huge plaque fish was fried ( you could see the grease ) , or accompanied by a sauce while not on a diet , we were often hard - pressed to find standard fare ( ordinary food , baked , grilled , etc ) - of course , given the water/lettuce problem , salads were also out of the question ( to their credit , the food was tasty , and the variety impressive , it was just the sheet volume of grease floating around that made meals pretty difficult ) we ended up eating pasta for the last 5-6 days ( it was very good , excellent sauces ) aside : other excellent food items included all breads and all desserts ( variety and taste truly phenomenal ) 13) rooms : good and bad the good : quite large , with a sitting area ( couch and wicker table set ) and bathroom ( exceptional , particularly the tub with integrated shower behind a glass partition ) 
not what expected after expecting luxury 4* , we had leaking bathrooms , toilets that did not flush - including the public toilets , which were constantly overflowing , no fixtures or fittings in bathrooms , ( we had two rooms as we had to change , after a flooding of water on bathroom floor ) , we were completely disappointed with the accomodation overall the rooms , we saw quite a few , are in need of refurbishment , the pictures in the brochure and online are nothing like where you stay , they are grubby the entertainment was very repetative , all by some nights embrassing the audience with going on stage doing pathetic games , it was just dancing the same dance to different music everynight the food , was never hot , never had enough plates , and not enough variety we were glad to be going home on the 31st dec as on the 2nd jan the hotel was 10% overbooked , which was going to be a huge problem a lot of the guests were already unhappy and were changing hotels after going to peurto plato in april 06, we have been very put off going back to dr on a positive note , the pool and beach so close to one another is very nice even though the location is a little remote in a nutshell , our advice is dont go find somewhere else , there are alot of other nice places to go in dp 
adquate stayed at the baja principe over the thanksgiving holidays the resort and the staff were very good but some things need to be looked at i upgraded to golden to get closer to the beach and more reservations at the theme resturants since the resort is so spread out you need to walk or ride the trams either to go to the beach or to the resturants - so no need to get close to the beach also , upon trying to reservations to the themed resturants i could only get one to the steak house at 9:15 four days later - could not really use the feature food was fair at best and the variety was poorer i was charged $28 00 for use of the in room safe they also advertise the mini - bar in the room but if you use it and want more than the norm the is an additional charge the exclusive reception and check in is no big deal because you naturally go to the main desk where they route you to a different area and you have to walk there leaving your luggage at the main desk - eaiser to check in at the main desk 
fair stay at bahia we returned from a 7 day stay at bahia principe on oct 28 many of the comments from previous guest are very accurate i 'll start with the positives the resort is beautiful and huge ( the tram makes it easy to get around ) the beach is gorgeous with wonderful fluffy sand and warm clear water the grounds are kept clean the pools are a great change from the salt water and there are many of them to choose from there are plenty of palapas at the beach and the pools the drinks are good and plenty of them the coco loco and banana mamma were our favorites from the lobby bar we were in diamond club so we went to the italian rest for lunch daily the japanese restaraunt and the steak grill were really good for the a la carte dinners negatives : our room stunk like must and humidity it really smelled terrible the cleaners moped with bleach one day but it still stank and we werent able to change rooms i have washed all my laundry 2x and the smell is still in all my clothing the food was typical buffet/all inclusive fare , fairly greasy , not always the temp the individual restaraunts were better however , this is pretty typical of the previous 3 all inclusives we have stayed at in the past some thing that i ate made me very ill for 2 days i had a fever and felt naseaus and was unable to go too far from the washroom from talking to other guests many others fell ill the same days that i did i assume it was something i ate the worst part of our stay was having belongings stolen the day before we were to leave we had tipped the maid daily and were fairly pleased with our room cleanliness the items taken were an mp3 player and headphones , a new bottle of lacoste cologne , digital sport watch and a $10 bill from my backpack i highly reccomend you use the safe for everything you can fit in there these items were not excessively expensive but they are a hassle to replace and they add up we reported it to the resort and they were only able to offer us spa services and 1 hour prior to our departure we werent interested in my opinion they could have done more to compensate us or to resolve the problem apparently this is relatively common as well the shows were terrible but that also is pretty common with all inclusives i agree with the previous post about the thongs our neighbors had a problem with bugs and mosquitos in there room , try not to have a room near the pond it is true most of the staff dont speak english however you are in a spanish speaking country if you ask respectfully if they can speak english most of them can a bit when we were there most of the guests were also spanish speaking overall we had a fair time at the bahia , however i highly doubt we will return there nor will we reccomend it to others 
french fries in paradise i just returned from a week at the gran bahia principe and it was a decent vacation but not necesarily because of the efforts of the resort rooms : the accomodations are very good spacious , clean and comfortable i did have a couple of problems during my stay 1) the tub clogged and there was a leak in the bathroom celiling due to heavy rain 2) after a major storm the power went out in the entire room making it a pain to dress for dinnerservice : this is where the hotel runs into the most problems everyone is quite friendly and makes it a point of asking you repeatedly if everything is okay the problem is that they ca not understand you if you have a problem and if they can understand you they do not seem to know what to do about it my bathroom repair took a long time and the electrical problem that happened in the afternoon was not fixed until after dinner at about 9pm both repairs also required that i call twice to ask someone for help not what i want to do on my vacation also , my call to bell services at checkout was futile 10 minutes they said i suspect if i had waited , i 'd still be sitting on the edge of my bed in short : the service is non - existent food : now this can chage things for me a place with all the aforementioned problems could still win me over if the grub is out of this world unfortunately , that was not the case here the buffet food is , well buffet food nothing memorable there you can probably find an item or two that you like mine was french fries ca not go wrong with french fries my package also included 4 ala carte selections we chose japanese , steak house , mexican and gourmet again nothing to really rave about a bit higher quality than the buffet but most folks have a hometown favorite that could easilty beat any of these establishment the japanese was the best courses of sushi , tempura , then meat and veggies flamed on the grill right before your eyes before you 're moved to the main dining area for dessert everything was kind of rushed in all the dining establishments no time to linger if you want whats on your plate you 'd better be actively eating or the plate will be snatched instantly i found that rather annoying of course drinks are included dinner comes with wine selection of red or white both overly sweet should be dessert wines you can order different wine at some of the ala cartes but of course it will cost you the pool/activities : the pools are great clear , clean and always full of fun plenty of room to gather or for couples to float off quietly alone all have jetted spas which are nice for a nice water massage and swim up bars of course you have to tip the bartenders for drinks that are more that really cute smoothies as for activities , i felt they were lacking or less publicized than true five star resort i did see water polo being played daily and a few random dance contests and disorganized games by the main pool supposedly there were aquaerobics , volleyball and spanish lessons just to name a few happening , but i never saw or heard about them the beach : it 's pretty to look at plenty of loungers for all who wish to bake however , if you want to go swimming you might like to stick to the pool this is the atlantic ocean , not the carribean sea so the waves are pretty rough and sea weed is very heavy on the beach overall , your vacation is always what you make of it however , if you 're going for ultra luxury , five - star service , fine dining , english speaking , grown - up oriented this ai not it if you have a family ( kids ) and want someplace laid back and are super easy - going this might be the one 
so so vacation just got back from our stay at the bahia principe punta cana warning : if you are from the states , do not expect great service pros : the beach was beautiful , although packed with topless smokers if you put your blinders on , you could look past that and take in the beautiful water and white sand beaches the rooms were immaculate despite other reviews , we did not have any insect problems , and our maid romona was so sweet and did an excellent jobs the grounds were very well kept they were constantly cleaning it and keeping it nice the pools were nice as well , although they too were super crowded weatherwise , we could not have asked for a better week we had low '90s everyday , and not a drop of rain cons : the people were not friendly i took basic spanish years ago , and while i am by no means fluent , my effort was not appreciated we got snapped at on many occassions while plates we cleared quickly and drinks were brought fairly quick , we were rarely approached with a smile this is quite opposite from my trip to mexico , where any attempt at the language was appreciated , and they were just as eager to learn about our culture as we were theirs the front desk did not speak good english they pretended like they did , although when you really needed something , they could do little to help i am from the new york city area , and i was looking forward to a low key vacation believe me , i was not anticipating a five star i would have stayed here and dined at the ritz if i wanted that our first night there , i read the policy that you must wear long pants and long sleeves to the buffet ( but only for dinner ) i was upset as i looked at my boyfriends wardrobe and saw the endless short - sleeve polos i asked the front desk what women must wear , and guest services told me that to the dinner buffet , women must wear skirts or long pants again , i glanced over at my 5 or 6 pair of dressy bermudas that are good enough for my office , but not for their buffet i told him this , and he said bermudas were not allowed i decided to check it out for myself , only to find the buffet packed with people in shorts , tees and flip flops i am still confused the food was not good the steak restaurant was the only really good meal however , to their credit , this is not a 5 star , so you ca not expect too much i left dinner everynight with a stomach ache it was that or starve i am not sure where you people are eating that found the food fabulous edible is more like it not much to do other outside of the resort , as the cities are not very safe we did the catamaran exursion , which was nice , and finally the staff was nice the only downside to that was the snorkeling saw only 2 types of fish i have snorkeled in belize , however i guess i am spoiled i was suprised to see that we were one of the few to tip at the end of the trip cheap cheap people in the dominican to add to the above , tourists there are unfriendly all they do is smoke i was bumped into several times , and i got not one excuse me while this is an all - inclusive trip , please tip for good service i was astonished at how ungrateful people were while i have more negatives than positive , all in all , it was a relaxing vacation if you want to sit back and relax and are not looking for crazy ngihtlife , this is for you to add to someones point about north americans staying away , i would like to agree 
non habla espagnol after spending a week at bahia principe , we are glad to return to toronto we travelled as a family and found both pros and cons to this resort there is seaweed and sand the water is not clear however , the sand is nice and white we were not able to find shade most of the time the beach is also very small all water activities are over - priced the pools were always packed with people and unfortunately , the water was very very hot ( the jacuzzis and the pools use the same water ) food : decent you wo not go hungry but do not expect gourmet meals the french , mexican and japanese a la carte restaurants were better than the buffets entertainment : terrible the largest problem we had with this resort was that most employees there did not know how to speak english or even french we found that if you did not speak spanish , you did not get as much attention , hence , bad service the nightly shows were all in spanish so we did not understand much but the dancing shows deserved an a for effort but not for presentation we spent a whole week saying non habla espagnolthere is also a casino where you can kill an hour or so rooms : the rooms were clean enough with the occasional creepy crawlers there were little ants on the dressers and ants crawling on the walls due to the massive size of this resort , there is a train/taxi service that drives you to one end of the resort to the other tipping is optinal but is always appreciated the alcoholic beverages were exremely weak having been to cuba three times before , dominican pales in comparison although it was not a bad vacation , we will not be going back mainly because of the language barrier in conclusion , north american tourists : stay away this resort is mainly for europeans 
great tour of the city the good aspects included the general scenery and landscaping the grounds were well maintained the staff in general was very pleasant walking on the white sand beach was also a must do activity by far the best thing to do was the trip to santo domingo , truly rich in historicity and old world charm the japanese restaurant was also a positive experience room service was mostly good good general ambience the not so good aspects were :1 if you have a sinus problem or are a non smoker this is not the place for you my wife and i were surrounded by smokers everywhere even in places that had some semblance of non - smoking signs this was the worst aspect and i would not return for this reason the huge property uses shuttles which become a necessary evil on very hot days sitting in the shuttles usually meant ingesting a lot of fumes i found that the rooms were not well lit during the days this was not an issue as you could open up the blinds but during the night there was barely enough light to read comfortably the food was average i had stomach problems and had to settle on white rice and bread by the fourth day plan to carry basic stuff like advil and pepto - bismol as you will pay dearly in the shops for these amenities the airport was a nightmare it was too small to handle the volume of passengers there was no ac and once again my wife and i were subjected to cigarette smoke 
ripped off , beware this place is not special , but i guess it 's a bargain since it 's lower end , expect poor and slow service also , the help will bully you into tipping them i was staying for a wedding they made us pay with a credit card when we checked in , stating that ( for some unknown reason ) they could not use the travelocity reservation , but that they would not charge travelocity what are you supposed to do in this situation , so we payed they charged us twice for the same nights i tried to get this resolved with them no luck , they usually do not answer the phone and there is never a manager travelocity was not helpful , but from their point of view , i guess that makes since nevertheless , i 'll probably go with orbitz or some place else then my visa card looks into it and accepted the lie that it was an additional tax an additional tax of 100% this is who they are at melia in the dr , so beware roaches and snakes 
not so friendly i decided to write a review because i often use this site to research my trips and it has been very helpful this was my second visit to punta cana d the first time my husband and i stayed at the bahia principe hotel , rather large for my taste , but with excellent service and amazing food note : you can never complain about the beach when it comes to punta cana now this time around we stayed at melia caribe because we had a wedding next door at the palma real ( which is way too expensive for our budget ) so here goes although the hotel and grounds are very nice at the melia - the staff is not by the way i am hispanic so spanish is my first language they are defintely not friendly , kind of rude and will not go out of their way for anything including : towels , directions , some coffee , extra water , or any other request basically , they want to be left alone the grounds are also extensive , and good luck trying to get anyone in a golf cart to stop and give you a ride to your room , even when they see you with luggage compared to the bahia principe hotel and the palma real the food at the melia is tasteless i will not stay at this hotel again it is not worth it i am thinking next time about the riu palace - it looks beautiful hope this helps in making your selection 
a bit disappointed i was down there for a wedding , first night when i walk into the room , there were crocoach crawling on one of the bed , bathroom door lock not working , they send a maintenance guy at 12:30 to try to fix it and told us that they cant get it done next day , on the next day , they came in while we were not in the room and kept our door wide open we live on the main floor , when maid came into clean up , she forgets to lock the balcony door twice out of 7 days on the wedding day , we were told that the band on our wrist can be cut off for photo and can bring it to reception to obtain a new one without a problem , when we went to the reception to obtain a new one , they told us that we will need our passport to get it , send most of us back to the room they should have a better communication with us , and should have more authority for customer service also , with a la carte dinner , they always lost our reservation the beach is good , food is good , guy that gave us coconut to drink is good customer service is so important and i think they need better training 
asyou 'd expect beware the timeshare sellers let me just start by saying this resort was exactly what we expected based on it?? 5 out of 6 star rating and reviews i had read on debbie?? dominican page and other sites there are two resorts here the melia caribe is geared towards the americans and english speaking customers while melia caribe tropical is geared towards the europeans from what i understand the main difference is the two have different check in lobbies , so the staff can speak that particular language everyone goes to the same beach , pools , restaurants , etc the resort is large and spread out over several acres the grounds are beautiful and well maintained the shuttle service can be a very slow , especially around dinner time , when everyone is trying to get to the restaurants sometimes , when it did come it was full flag down a golf cart and tip the driver a few bucks if they can take you to your destination they will food : our experience was good at each restaurant we went to : dominican , chinese , american , and french the steak at the french restaurant was out of this world i eat steak maybe twice a year , this was so good we did have a problem getting into our restaurants of choice we were not able to get into the japanese at all we did get the french twice though and did not hesitate to go back the buffet was good you have to remember that they are trying to appeal all sorts of nationalities all sorts of cheeses for breakfast ( french ) , lox and chips and salsa ( count me in ) , tons of fresh fruits and juices i did read about and experienced on our last day ? a bird in the fruit bin that grossed me out beach  pool : i read where people complained about the seaweed on the beach let me tell you , i live on the atlantic ocean and no one is allowed to touch ( clean up ) the seaweed because it is a ??atural resource? these people are out there every morning cleaning up the seaweed yes , there is some seaweed on the beach ? welcome to the ocean also , it is a public beach - expect tp be approached by locals the beach is clean and the water is warm ( but not overly , like the gulf of mexico ) yet refreshing the sand is beautiful , however , for some reason no seashells or rocks ( odd ) not that , that is detrimental because you can go shoeless , on the beach where i live you need to wear beach shoes , lest you cut your feet the pools were beautiful and well maintained as well there is a swim up bar at the pool the kids loved that there is lots of shade for those who don?? want to spend the day in the sun the pools are crowded lots of water sports to keep you busy , entertainment : the entertainment basically begins at 10pm way too late for us , we were tired after a day in the sun and a big dinner at the towel ??eadquarters? at the pool you can get a schedule of events for the day there is something going on all of the time horseshoes , volleyball , dancing lessons , etc we did not do any of that , but it was nice to know you could if you wanted to there is also water aerobics at the pool every day that was a lot of fun non - motorized sports are included for example , we took out a catamaran the problem is you are supposed to have it for a certain duration of time but no one has a watch on them to know how long they have been out ( or were they just having too much fun so you may need to wait , even if you reserved something for a specific time don?? blame the staff , it?? not their fault we did parasailing right at the resort ( $85 for two ) which was so worth it the staff did an exceptional job i had never parasailed before and i was nervous but they did a great job shopping : twice a week the resort has local vendors you probably heard about them whereas you can bargain with them one day they are on the american side one day on the euro , check with the resort , they were there tuesday  thursday if you walk down the beach you can also find local vendors , they are like hawks looking for you though , i preferred the vendors at the hotel fyi their local stone , larimer comes in many different qualities see the stones at the euro gift shop so you are familiar with the stone and don?? expect real silver from any vendors my daughter bought a larimer bracelet from the gift ??ut? near the pool and the stone popped out within 5 minutes , unfortunately we were already home , or else i would have brought it back the gift shop on the euro side is larger and has much more to offer the water : 6 out of 8 of us were ill at one point basically we had the ??quirts? ? a day or so nothing that would ruin your vacation but make certain you have your medication of choice ( i prefer pepto bismal , my sister prefers imodium ) one of the staff had the bartender fix me a local remedy with bitters , sprite , a little alcohol and who know what else it was gross but they only gave me a 1/2 cup and i felt better i was not so sick that it kept me from the pool ? i just set up next to the bathrooms ??ust in case? timeshare : it is amazing how they know if you have attended once you attend they know it and leave you alone find out in advance what is expected of you we were told if we sat through a 90 minute presentation , which was too much of my precious vacation time , so we bargained and received a $50 gift certificate ( my sister used her for parasailing , i used mine in the gift shop ) once i told the salesman there was no way i would buy anything today and no way i would buy anything without researching customer feedback on the internet he lost interest in his sales pitch sounds good to me ? took my $50 gift cert and i was outta there 
dont eat anything we stayed at the hotel from the 9 oct to the 23 oct , there were 13 of us in total as we travelled out to the dominican for our wedding i would like to start by saying the hotel is amazing very well kept and the staff were so friendly and helpfull our wedding day was amazing and all our guests loved it apart from one little problem on the 2nd day at the hotel we tried to book an a la carte for all our party but the a la cartes at the top of our list were all shut for restoration we were slightly upset by this as we were not informed by the travel agent or when we checked in at reception we managed to get boked in at the japanese which was fantastic and also booked at the american grill this is where things started to go downhill one by one everyone in my party started with severe stomach cramps which turned in to upset stomachs and vomiting i wont go into detail but if you end up the same there is no way you will be leaving the hotel room when a few of us were finally well enough to leave the room we started to talk to other guests who informed us that the a la cartes were not shut for restoration but were in fact closed for deap cleaning after giving other guests food poisoning it really is a shame as the hotel is superb but something as important as this realy ruins your holiday especially your wedding day i wont comment on anything else as i dont see there is a point unless you plan on not eating for 2 weeks 
loved punta cana , hated hotel this is only the place for you if you do not care about quality at all and you are going for cheap i love punta cana , and we plan to go every year from now on , but i would not stay here again i will stay at the ritz in cap cana from now on it is way to spread out i had read that in several reviews , but i thought how bad could it really be the food was terrible i would rather go to a fine hotel and decide on quality not quanity 
save your money this was by far the worst all - inclusive hotel that i have ever stayed in let me start with the fact that we did not pay for royal service however , we expected acceptable service , which was not provided we arrived at the front desk  had to wait 45 minutes to check in once we checked in , they sent us to our room , which they claimed was ready we took about a 1/2 mile walk ( there is a train that runs every 20 minutes ) to our room to find that the a/c was being worked on ( looked like it exploded ) , so we could not get into our room  was faced with a 1/2 mile walk back to the front desk we finally got into our room , changed  went to the buffet ( which was decent , particularly for all - inclusive ) when we returned to our room ( around midnight ) , we were locked out of our room we had to walk the 1/2 mile back to the desk to get our key ( credit card type ) recharged we stayed at the hotel for four days and had to get our key re - charged at least 10 times i spent more time in the hotel lobby than on the beach we were there for a wedding  this was a problem for almost everyone there for the wedding (40 people ) though we complained , it did not matter unless you were royal service , they did not care what you thought of the hotel further , to get to the breakfast/lunch buffets , you had to go past the time share desk they would pounce on you every time , even if you said you were not interested i felt that the hotel was more concerned with selling the time shares than taking care of their guests it got so bad that we eventually started sneaking into the buffets to avoid the sales pitch the beach is wonderful and the pool bar was fun however , i have stayed at lower star 'd hotels in dr and had a better experience my recommendation is to avoid this over sized hotel unless you want to be hasseled by sales people and treated like second class citizens as non - royal service 
average resort returned aug 22 from my 1 week stay at the melia i 'll begin my review with the flight to punta cana as all should know by now tropical storm faye hit the dominican republic on the 15th of august needless to say that our trip was the most eventful journey my family and i have ever made i have personally traveled just about every continent and i have never experienced what i lived through that day first of all , i had been checking throughout the week the national hurricane center weather outlook for the region there was activity brewing out in the atlantic and it appeared to intensify as the week progressed on the day of the flight i had checked the depression 's progress and it was sitting right off the coast of dr it was clear that the storm was more than just rain however , the carrier air transat elected to have the flight 's departure proceed from montreal i had advised them that the weather was not good and they should reassess their decision unfortunately the carrier proceeded as planned well needless to say that the flight never landed at punta cana but was diverted to puerto plata but only after an attempt was made to land at la romana the flight landed at 6:00 pm all passangers were stranded in the airport as there was no flight arrangements into punta cana the plane we were on left for toronto without any announcements the transat representative addressed the passengers at 9:30 pm and gave the following said that we have to leave by bus for punta cana , an 8 hour ride , or spend the rest of our vacation in puerto plata and try to find a hotel at our own expense all hotels were apparently booked well having heard that a tragic accident occurred the same day resulting in the death of 22 tourists did not assure us that this decision was the right one nonetheless we had no choice but to leave the airport as the police were called in to evict us as midnight was approaching as a side bar note , we all felt as if we were a nuisance to the dominican people working in the airport we were told by the senior police officer that he wanted to go home to sleep and we were the ones keeping him from doing that so we had to leave incredible to believe that one of this country?? important source of foreign currency comes through tourism and yet they fail to adequately make the tourist feel welcomed we left the airport at 12:15 am and arrived at the punta cana airport at 7:40 am to be separated in respective resort buses by the way the travel was adventurous and at times terrifying now for my review : pre - travel plan : my wife , my nine - year old son and myself were vaccinated for hep a and b ( two doses each ) my son had taken dukoral , my wife nothing and i had taken daily dosage totaling 60 million cfu of probiotic pills over a two week period to counter td we all ate salads , fruit and vegetables ( cooked and raw ) as for water , we drank bottled and water that was said to be bottled by the waiters also , we had sodas with ice my son and i had no complications my wife had all the symptoms of td for one day she did not need medical attention but she sure watched what she ate afterwards all three of us took malaria pills ( melarone ) with no side effects whatsoever our decision to take the pills was based on the advisory notice i have traveled extensively , especially to africa , and being stricken with malaria is a serious issue we did not see a single mosquito while we were there but one of the couples who we met on the plane had a mosquito infestation in their room their three kids and them were bitten quite a few times on the arms and face one of the kids came down with a fever two days later i am glad that we did take the pills check - in : there were three couples from our flight that were checking in so check - in was 25 minutes and we were told to go have breakfast as the room was not ready didn?? quite understand why as the resort was not full i did inquire about some sort of credit for the night that we did not stay but were politely told that it wasn?? their fault so one hour later , we went to our rooms and the luggage had not yet arrived after several calls , the luggage arrived the front desk was polite but no smiles as if we were disturbing them from their conversations rank : 2 5site : it has been stated many times that this place covers a lot of acreage well you just have to experience it there are trains that will take you throughout the caribe and tropical sections of the resort however , you can definitely flag down a cart that will take you where you need to go or , you can do what i did which was to get one the vacation club concierge to do all the restaurant bookings and arranging for a cart to be at your room when you need it the landscaping is definitely beautiful and the setting at night gets amplified with the gentle lighting rank : 4 5 room : our room was in building 1 room 0114 this was a family suite with two double beds , a single bed which could have been used as a sofa , and a sofa also could have been used a single bed the room was clean but outdated the bathroom ceiling sprang a leak which took three days to get fixed there were no bugs we had clean towels every day along with washcloths that you must ask for we had thought about upgrading to royal service but the added cost of $70 per person per day for 1 bedroom suite or $90 per person per day for a master suite did not excite me our room was located no more than 100 feet from either the agora grill or the tropical pool and we were no more than 300 feet from the beach the agora grill was closed two days after our arrival and were left with the turey grill which was a 5 minute walk from our room rank : 3 5food : for the first two days we ate our breakfast at the grill restaurants which were open aired and for the balance of our stay we ate the international market place which is closed with a/c the selection and overall quality is better at the market place however , it does not mean that the food is better tasting we basically stuck with hard boiled eggs , juices which were not freshly squeezed , and breads essentially all of their basic cooking is deep rooted in cooking oil which gets to be hard on the system on a continuous basis for lunch we stuck with turey each day came with different selections although you could stick with pasta and pizza if you wished the taste was mostly bland on the hot dishes unfortunately flies were everywhere and over the food i guess it is to be expected in an open air environment as for the a - la - carte restaurants , we consider that the thai ( the pagoda ) to have been the one which very good 
above average facilities below average service we just returned from 8 days at the melia caribe ( aug 1 - 8) the resort is big , bustling and , in many ways , beautiful unfortunately , the service does not remotely match the quality of the facilities royal service is anything but royal - - average would be a better description we encountered check - in difficulties , maintenance issues , transportation issues , rudeness be prepared for very slow response times and endless communication struggles ( no one speaks english ) the beach was extremely nice go early in the morning before the sea grass gets all stirred up by the motorized water sports good luck trying to hitch a ride from the royal service villas to the beach the golf carts run inconsistently , when they run at all the food was pretty good be sure to visit the japenese restaurant it was as good as everyone claimed if you are looking for a disney - like experience with big crowds , lush grounds and you have a high tolerance for inefficiencies , you will probably enjoy this resort it is very family friendly and does offer alot in the way of tropical beauty as for our family , we do not plan to return just too many frustrations if you are going to the melia caribe , be sure to take all of your paperwork from your travel agent with you you will need it when you check in also , you will be ordered to attend certain meetings at certain times this ticked me off we did not attend one single meeting if you too elect to not attend the meetings , be sure you get your transfer pass the day before you check - out this is your ticket back to the airport we spent about $150 in tips looking back , we probably would have gotten the same ( marginal ) service if we had spent $15 in tips lastly , if you are planning a romantic getaway , i strongly recommend you study the different floor plans before selecting your room type our room ( royal service , bldg #49) , had a see - through bathroom off the bedroom yes , you could see into the toilet area as well if modesty and/or privacy is important to you , this see - through design will severely disturb you and heaven forbid that you get sick , as i did a couple of nights hopefully , you get the picture here i wish we had chosen the one bedroom suite with two bathrooms 
i would not return here we just got back from our stay at the melia caribe tropical we stayed there from thursday 7/31- monday 8/4 leading up to our departure , i had been reading the reviews on tripadvisor and i have to say that most have been on the money if you are looking for a clean room with plenty of towels ( including wash clothes ) and good service , then definitely book royal service i ca not stress that enough upon arrival , we waited in line to be checked in for over an hour there did not appear to be any particular reason why we waited this long ( there were probably 8 people in front of us when we arrived ) the service is just very slow we were determined not to let this bother us ( as we had read on tripadvisor that this was an issue here ) we requested to be in a building near the beach so the manager put us in building 32 and asked us not to go to our room for an hour as they were still getting it ready ( it was about 4:30pm at this point ) we readily agreed and went to get some food and waited about an hour and a half before heading to our room when we arrived , there were about 4 maintenance people in our room working on the ceiling/plumbing in the bathroom the head maintenance person actually asked us if someone had sent us to this room he seemed very surprised that they would book someone in this room i asked him if we should call and try to get moved and he said no and it would be no problem but just give him another hour needless to say , the first night it rained hard and the bathroom floor was soaked from the leak we also saw large insects in the bathroom we called to complain and they said that they would send someone over first thing in the morning to fix the leak but no one ever showed since our stay was relatively short , we decided it was not worth the hassle of dealing with their management and trying to get moved we read that it is a good idea to tip so that you get better service we tipped everyone in hindsight , i think that it was really only worth it ( if you are looking for better service ) to tip the maid and bartenders the casino was shady one of the dealers actually told my boyfriend that he wanted to punch him my boyfriend had done well at the casino over the past few nights and had done very well off of that particular dealer the night prior i promise you that our actions had not warranted this threat we were always very pleasant and courteous to all the dealers ( especially with tipping ) the food was average/below average the japanese restaurant is definitely the best you are definitely hounded by people trying to get you to purchase their time share we did not have any issues getting restaurant reservations we went to the spa for massages and they were very nice there the grounds are beautiful and very well kept the place is huge ( and confusing to get around as there are few signs ) however that did not bother us as we did not mind walking we absolutely made the best of this and tried hard to not let it ruin our vacation i think our experience in punta cana would have been much better had we stayed somewhere else 
melia diarrhea tropical we went with a group of 10 people and i have been home for two days and am finally off of the toilet long enough , i hope , to write this like just about everyone writing about this place , the grounds were beautiful and well maintained check in gave us our first glimpse of what was to come apparently noone in the dr has , or ever will utter these four words  may i help you after waiting to check in for 20 minutes we finally cornered a desk clerk a resort this size with as many americans visiting should have at least one staff member fluent in english it definitely would cut down on the check in times if they could understand us and we understand them they also need to at very least be able to give us correct information i think , we were told royal service was $70 a day per person ( another $2500 for my group of 4, a bit much do not you think , melia ) while another family in our group was quoted $90 a day per person by a different clerk never did get an answer on that one it was after 3:30pm when we arrived at our room only to find the beds unmade and towels on the floor any motel 6 in the world will not let you go to your room if it 's not ready but this 4 star just sent you on your way the room was ok but try to get a first floor room if you still want to go the second floor rooms have vaulted ceilings and the air just does a minimal job while the first floor rooms were actually cold one bed was fine while the other was caved in the middle maid service was hit or miss we never did get our fourth towel for 4 people and the room was not made up one day even at 4:30 pm ( four star ) the shower water temp control was non existent ( no cold water nothing like a hot shower on a sunburn ) and the toilet filled with scalding hot water when flushed making each and every all too often visit all that much more special the restaurants were just ok and the food was passable if you could keep it down or in the manditory reservations are a joke all the restuarants always had empty tables the buffet was ok and even had saltine crackers available for a short time for those of us that could not eat anything else everyone in our group was in great spirits the first day and wondering what all the negative reports were about everyone in our party was sick beginning the second day with vomiting and diarrhea the kids in our group seemed to bounce back , but the the adults all had a very long week , even with imodium bar service at the pool was also hit or miss some days you got your 8oz semi cold drink or beer quickly and other days you just stood and sweat because you did not exsist we have to agree with another report posted here about tipping if your provide decent service a tip is in order , but in the dr you are expected to tip everyone before they do anything whether it 's done correctly or not side trips are another adventure trips are not refundable unless you call your special agent  the night before your adventure to cancel that must be why there 's a phone on the wall by the toilet if you are sick the morning of your trip , too bad , most trips leave at 8 am and your special agent does not roll in till 9:30 we were told by him that i needed $150 medical excuse from the hotel in order to get a $75 trip refunded makes perfect sense to me it is a different planet outside the resorts apparently in the dr garbage belongs on the side of the road , if you want to call that pot holed piece of asphalt a road public beaches are just another place for locals to dump stoves , refrigs , cars , etc and set up yet another almost free  tablet of trinkets in another 5-7 years the whole island will be a land fill it really is too bad the natives think so little of their paradise t he beach was ok , however this was the first island in the carribean that we visited that has ever had seaweed or some type of vegetation washed up on the sand the pool was ok , but not refreshing could have been cleaner the trains to transport you around the compound were sporadic , some days really good and other days not so good and one really needed to be overhauled diesel smoke and high temps and humidity make for a less than enjoyable ride the casino was small and extremely smokey ca not tell you much about the entertainment because we were usually scrambling back to our rooms after dinner for an imodium nightcap not for that kind of money if tourism is going to be the dr 's major industry besides tobacco , they 've got a really long way to go as far as service and health issues before they even come close to any of the other carribean islands or cruise lines 
not a great choice my husband and i visited this hotel for our anniversary trip we take a trip to the caribbean every year and we chose the dominican republic we were aware that we had to pay the $10 00 to get in the country but we were not aware that in order to get good service you had to pull out a dollar we paid a lot of money for this all inclusive resort and we had to upgrade to royal service and tip non stop to get decent service the customer service is not the best the dominican people are not the friendliest i understand that their country is very poor , but they do have a job to do and that is to serve the guest at the resort i believe in tipping , but usually after i receive good service i must say the food was good , but the bartenders did not make good drinks at all every time you ask for a drink if they did not have a spanish name for it they did not know what it was i do not recommend this resort to anyone that does not speak spanish fluently it is a huge communication barrier and that interferes with your service please avoid the ??elcome package? it is a time share/ vacation package presentation this was a major turn off , i am trying to enjoy my expensive vacation and you have people manipulating you to receive a package and waste at least 2 hours of your day if you are not on the royal service side you have to wait for a train in the hot sun to come and get you to take you to the main building for the restaurants and entertainment huge problem ) the pool closed at 7 pm i have a sun allergy so i have to swim when the sun goes down the people in this country are mostly hustlers and they use the communication barrier as a way to get over on you the souvenirs are not a reasonable price ( do not go to higuey they are the same price ) and you will find most of the souvenir shops along the beach i do not feel it was enough activities planned for the guest on the resort it was rather bland and boring the beach is open to the locals that try to sell items and excursion that was very annoying as well if you are planning to visit this resort please have a lot of dollar bills or pesos because your service depends on it 
beautiful resort but do not visit during the peak season the resort is both beautiful and large there are several lounge areas and two pool bars one of the pool bars is in the vip ( royal service area ) check - in was a bit of a pain since the lobby isn?? enclosed , so it?? not air conditioned certain parts of the dominican airport are not air conditioned so standing in a hot lobby behind several other couples waiting to check in is less than comfortable express check in and check out is available to royal service members only we were told to leave our baggage at the front lobby and the bell boys would bring it to the room this was a completely foreign concept to me , but it was nice not having to lug around our heavy bags , and once we actually walked the grounds and located our room , i understood why they bring you your bags to your room you will waste a lot of time walking the resort , or waste a lot of time on the train , which makes multiple stops the other option is to flag down a golf cart and tip the driver for a ride , but this is not always easy to do reservations : we visited the resort during the peak season , so making dinner reservations was a complete joke you couldn?? call before 9 a when we did , the line was busy we would get through around 9:30am , only to be told that there was no open spots anywhere in their 11 restaurants you are not allowed to make a reservation more than 2 days in advance , unless you are royal service , and then you can make your reservations a week out if you don?? manage to get dinner reservations , you must eat dinner off - site at the mall next door , unless you are royal service member then you can at least eat at the buffet that is open until 11p my biggest complaint in addition to the difficulty of making reservations is the fact that even if you do get a reservation , you must call back after 2pm to confirm again , and that still doesn?? guarantee your time our reservations were pushed back several times without the staff telling us in advance so , we had to stop what we were doing in order to make our dinner time , and when we get there , we are told our time is not 8:15pm , but has been moved to 9:30pm guest service is less than helpful , unless you are member of royal service food : the buffet food was okay but i had a hard time finding healthy dishes even the vegetables are cooked in oil or butter , and the salads are doused in dressing or oil a person gets sick of eating fruit everyday dinner was either just okay or excellent it probably depends on what you order , and who?? working in the kitchen on any given night as for tipping , the money that we saved booking this vacation could have been pilfered away with all the tipping you??e expected to do after you pay your $10 at the airport , you may have to visit the bathrooms i shocked to see a bathroom attendant who wanted to be tipped for handing me a paper towel i??l get my own damn paper towel then you are faced with either fighting off the guys who want to be tipped for getting your bags for you you will be expected to tip your bus driver who brings you to the resort , and the bell boys who bring your bags to the room you can tip the bartenders but i don?? think it made a difference either way we never had to wait too long for a drink anyway besides , there are enough bars in the place that if the wait is too long at one , you can walk a short distance to another lounge where there is less of a wait we didn?? tip the bartenders most of the time , nor the waiters , unless the service was extremely good tipping the maid service doesn?? seem to help one way or the other i didn?? notice if the room was cleaned earlier because of it , and we didn?? receive anything extra in the mini fridge at one point , i actually had to leave the maid a note to refill the coffee what you read about the absence of washcloths is true , unless you are royal service read on for more details of what the royal service is actually all about , and then you can decide whether the $70 in free resort money is worth about 2 hours of your time the beach is stunning and clean though if you walk past the resort a ways toward the gift shops , you will notice how dirty the shore looks , because this is the area where the locals hang people that run the gift shops will approach you and ask you to visit their shops where they promise a ??ood price? you can manage a bargain , but the haggling takes patience we took an excursion to santo domingo i would wholeheartedly not recommend this excursion the 3 hour drive ended up being 5 5 hours each way , and total was just under 15 hours the advertised time says it is a 12 hour excursion apparently , that?? 12 hours dominican time the first stop was a hole in the ground , known as the three eyes it is a cave , in which an earthquake created 3 lakes within we drove by the christopher columbus lighthouse but were unable to go inside you could only take photos we stopped by a sugar cane statue , and took a few more photos lunch was decent then onto the house of diego , the son of christopher columbus , where we able to go inside and take a tour from there , we visited the cathedral , which is not air conditioned we walked right by 2 museums and the hard rock caf? , and were instead dropped in front of a tourist trap , a , colonial market you are given 45 minutes to make your purchases the prices are beyond ridiculous : $9 usd for a shot glass , $15 usd for an ashtray , etc the prices are also non negotiable , but you get a 20% discount off most things because of the tour operator still , the prices are no bargain i was disappointed that we were unable to go off on our own for a bit , and were unable to haggle with the local vendors for some good bargains going to and from , you see poverty and the third world country that is the dominican republic the tour operator never mentioned it , but i think it would have been worth mentioning overall , the impression i took away from the dominican republic is that they don?? really preserve their history , and don?? take pride in their country we took a snorkeling excursion via scuba caribe , which seems to work with the hotel it is an hour and a half , and $29 per person booked via viator you are taken out on a glass bottom boat to the coral reef , where you can happily snorkel for an hour royal service : you will be approached from the moment you walk into the hotel about making an appointment for this my husband and me finally agreed , just so they would stop hassling us about it they tell you that the royal service is not a timeshare , because there are no black out dates options that are not used one year will roll over to another year there are over 350 hotels and resorts to use the options with , and you can even use your masgold points to pay for airfare the royal service rooms are equipped with a kitchen/kitchenette with granite countertops , and refrigerator comes stocked with drinks 
avoid like the plague let me start with the good , since there wo not be much , the resort was beautiful it was huge , clean , and well maintained it was almost too huge , but i enjoyed the large spacious feel ( my wife did not though ) if you don?? want to ready the entire thing to get the idea , avoid this resort like the plague well , that 's all of the good , now for the bad the food was not good at all the restaurants were just south of ok , but everyone we went with was sick at least once the japanese restaurant was the best , but we had to agree to a time share presentation to get reservations for that the buffet near the main entrance was the best , and with the exception of the lobster night , it was mediocre at best everyone was sick at least once , and two of our group were still sick when they got home my wife missed two days of work when we got home because of something she ate there the pools close at 7 who closes a pool at 7 in the caribbean we would have stayed in longer but they would throw us out at 7 the staff was less than motivated to help you out i do not know if it is a cultural thing or what , but if , if , you could get their attention they would slowly wander over and take your order then they would turn around and leisurely walk away , probably filling other orders , and finally remember you ordered something if it was not beer there was no way you could get the same drink mixed the same way twice also , frozen drinks were few and far between trying to get a drink menu was like pulling toe nails off a police dog now , if you tipped them , it was a whole different story , see next paragraph i paid a lot of money to avoid having to take money with me everywhere i have no problem with tipping , but i do not expect to have to tip every person i see when i 'm on vacation i specifically requested a vacation through my travel agent where i did not have to tip it starts at the airport ( of course ) where you tip a guy to move your bag about 30 feet to the bus this is standard , so i was not too upset also , you have to buy a pass into the country ( $10) you walk the pass about 10 feet to another guy that takes it from you what a scam then you get on your apple bus ( that was my vacation company ) the apple representative tells you how long you will be on the road to your hotel and you arrive after he announces that you do not have to tip the driver , but the economy survives on it you also get the typical speech how your driver just happens to be the best in the country my bus ride was 15 minutes long and i did not see one nascar worthy moment during my trip so you get pressured to tip him on the way off as soon as you are off the bus the porters have their hands out to take a tip for removing your bags from the bus and putting them near the front desk then your bags show up at your room somewhere in the next two hours if you tip them , you get them a lot faster the maids will clean your room faster and better if you leave a tip for them apparently you could also tip the maids and they would stock your mini fridge with rum , but i never tried the bartenders will serve you faster if you tip them i tried tipping one of them to see what the difference was , and anytime i saw him after that he immediately asked me if i needed anything they expect the tips up front , then provide the service , instead of working for them/earning them after a job well done that irritates me i tip based on service provided , not on the hope my service will be good there were no bars on the beach the nearest bar was a considerable walk and no one came out to bring drinks now , if you tipped the bartenders at the pool bar ( a considerable distance away ) they would come out to you and bring trays of drinks ( i saw it ) , of course , that would leave the pool bar understaffed and prolong the wait the bartenders were less than motivated unless you tipped them up front , then the biggest tipper got the first and best service the second day we were there a note was slipped under the door telling us we had to meet the ??pple guy? at the front dest to confirm our departure times we had to meet him at 5:30 no way was i going to take time out of my vacation to track down a guy on his schedule the next day we got the same note we finally started looking for him on the 5th day the front desk didn?? know when he would be there , the other travel agencies told us he was off , the customer service guy told us to check early in the morning , and no one was right basically we looked for him until someone from funjet was kind enough to look in the apple book and tell us what time we had to be there what a joke we paid a lot of money for this vacation and they can?? even just slip a piece of paper under the door to tell us when to be in the front lobby they wanted us to take time out to seek the guy that was never there i?? sure there is more and i know this was lengthy , but i wanted to let everyone know about every aspect good luck if you choose this one if you can handle the time share guys they will give you $70 00 in certificates ( you can even exchange it for currency in the casino ) but they are going to try to get you hooked for 90 minutes and won?? even tell you the price until the end 
a let down we stayed with a large group of people at the melia caribe in punta cana at first glance , the resort itself is beautiful the grounds are well kept and the pool is exciting and fun the lobby is pretty with ample tropical flowers then , almost instanly we ran into problems check in took us an entire hour ( there were only two people ahead of us the language barrier was by far the worst i have ever experienced on other vacations , even when the national language is not english , we have felt a sense of a mutual concern and attempts to understand each other well , not here everything seems like a problem after finally checking in , we were taken to our room via golf cart the room was unimpressive bare walls uncomfortable pillows although it seemed to be clean to me , others in ourparty complained of ants and hair found in thier room through out the stay i felt like the room was a bit dreary and was not overly enthused to spend a lot of time in it one extremely important thing to consider when staying at this resort is the size of it it is huge you need to be driven by either a golf cart of a train ( which does not go to your room but follows a mapped out route i got lost going home the first night after the bar and it took nearly two hours to get to my room every single building is identical and i was confused right up until our fifth day the golf carts are not as easily accessible as they are made out to be in fact , i usually reached my point of destination before even spotting one also , i usually tipped the driver between 3 to 5 dollars each time they gave me a lift and only once or twice was thanked i do not mind walking on a vacation but when you just want to go to get a bite to eat ( since there is no room service ) you do not feel much like walking 20 minutes or so in the heat the food was ok not terrible but not great the french restaurant was my favorite but some people in our party said that the japanese restaurant was fantastic you must make reservations to be seated at least 24 hours in advance and the host or hostess will almost always have a problem finding your name we had a problem being seated one night and we could clearly see in the door that there were about 10 open tables frustrated , we left because they were not at all willing to solve the problem in fact , they just stopped talking to us all together i have to mention that we had been extremely polite throughout our trip perhaps if we we more of a forthright type of people we would have received more help also , i have to add unfortunately that i became sick the day before we left with sever stomach cramps and loose bowels my husband did as well as around 5 other members of our party i did not drink the water but did drink some ice i have a feeling however it was the buffet food the bars were somewhat fun i had a good time watching the karaoke and dancing in the fun bar the only beer is el presidente which is not bad the liquor is on the cheaper side which i am not a fan of also , the music is usually in spanish which is fun for a time but them gets redudant to those of us who do not speak spanish overall , i would not advise people to stay at the melia caribe i have been to close to 20 islands in the caribbean and hawaii and this was by far the worst some people in our party were having their first island experience and were axtremely turned off and disappointed 
please read before booking melia caribe tropical before i begin to detail our experience at the melia caribe tropical in punta cana , dominican republic let me first explain that this was the honeymoon my husband and i never had the opportunity to go on this trip was ten years in the making and something we had worked , saved and planned for to say the trip was a disappointment would be a gross understatement our initial welcoming into the hotel was non existent , we got off the hotel shuttle as we watched our bags thrown on the sidewalk after waiting several minutes for some kind of greeting , direction , explanation , and several attempts to speak to the bellhops we were pointed in the direction of the front desk and told to leave our belongings out front we approached the front desk which had no line just masses of people bunched around the counter when we finally were able to get someone to respond to us we were told that our room was not ready and we would have to wait another 30 minutes check in time was 3:00, we were told this at approximately 3:15 we waited the 30 minutes and returned to a similar scene at the front desk the woman working the desk completely ignored us for about 10 minutes before finally telling us she would check our room we stood there for another 30-40 minutes while she repeatedly took other customers without ever checking on our room at one point she took the information booklet she had given us earlier containing our towel passes and with our room number written on it and crossed out the room number and gave it to another customer in line we finally were given a room after approximately an hour and a half , and more than a full hour after check in time although i understand things happen and rooms are not always ready on time , it was the complete lack of concern , apology , or even common courtesy that was very upsetting the front desk acted as if we should be grateful we got a room at all our next incident occurred when we went to retrieve our bags from out front , which were still sprawled on the sidewalk where they had been thrown obviously eager to finally get to the room , we asked the bellhop to please take them to our room we were told they would be there in 2 hours not willing to wait that long , my husband had to carry them the considerable distance to our room since , we were told by several passing workers in golf carts that they could not give us a ride we had hoped that this would be an end to the problems on our much - anticipated trip the same unsatisfactory and many times down right rude customer service that greeted us on our arrival continued through out the trip dinner reservations were messed up , we were told we had none , until we physically had to point to our name on the list and show the ??ost? countless times we were out right ignored while trying to take advantage of the ??ll inclusive? simple requests like ??ay i have two beers were answered with stares if at all our room , which we had been so desperate to get into , was located directly above a room being renovated drills and saws are not part of what i consider a relaxing vacation when we asked to be moved because of the disruption , we were told no as a matter of fact the only thing the staff did seem ready to respond to any request was no the one thing we did enjoy about this trip , a snorkeling tour , not affiliated with the meli? caribe tropical , was even ruined by the hotel we ordered a dvd of the experience to share with our family the dvd was delivered to the hotel , which lost it again , we were met with the same poor attitude that was the norm on this trip , ??h well , it is not here , there is nothing we can do? never in my life did i think i would be counting the days until my dream vacation was over this trip was a nightmare from start to finish i have never written a letter like this before , but i can not in good conscience let anyone else spend their hard earned money and wasted their all too precious time with loved ones experiencing the things my husband and i dealt with while at the meli? caribe tropical 
pros/cons of melia caribe tropical we just returned from 5 nights at the melia caribe tropical while the property is beautiful and well maintained , it is very spacious and the activities ( pools , beach , restaurants , casino ) are not within walking distance we were told there was a train that could take us around the property i envisioned the train in disney world it was more like a train from a kiddie park that travelled at 5 mph it took 15-20 minutes to completely circle the property if you upgrade to the royal service you will be driven around the property via golf carts - - i would highly recommend this option the sleeping room was nice however , the plumbing in the bathroom is horrible also wash cloths are not provided and the hotel is extremely stingy with bath towels the pools and beach are beautiful the food was very good a large selection and variety of items for everyone 's taste we only booked one 'ala carte ' dinner and were disappointed in the portion size , so we went to the all - you - can - eat buffets instead the atmosphere in the main dining room is very casual no need to dress up for dinner i was also surprised that most of the hotel staff does not speak english even the simplest things ( i , black coffee , diet soda ) was difficult to communicate overall , we had a nice time and would go back - - but only by booking the royal service 
grounds were breathtaking but hospitality not so much my wife and i are in our early 20's and came on our honeymoon for the week of 6/29-7/4 we were blown away at first by the architecture and plant life at the resort but were abrutly brought back down to earth when it took us over an hour to check - in there were 2 people working at the front desk and they looked to be in no hurry to help people out in a timely manner this was not a good way to start off a trip we found out the hard way by trying to walk to our room from the lobby that the resort is huge the grounds were amazing though we loved all the food surprisingly , the mexican restaurant was our favorite the only other problem we had with the resort was the service/hospitality the service in the restaurants was not that great , and the bartenders were not all that friendly , either i guess the language barrier played a big factor in that my advice would be to hone up on your spanish before you go 
royal service , royal waste my husband and i just returned from the melia caribe we stayed from june 27 to july 4 we opted for the royal service because it sounded fantastic , what a waste of money first , the grounds were beautiful and the food was good i researched the property for six months before our vacation so i knew what to expect this resort is very family oriented during our stay there were many obnoxious children in the royal service pool area there were also many large groups of families i would not recommend the resort for couples the royal service did not have any pluses at all our room was mediocre it was very outdated we had three bugs in our room anytime we went to the vip area to ask questions the help was so busy talking to each other they did not seem like they wanted to be bothered we called the evening before our flight back to ohio to arrange to have our luggage picked up but they told us to call in the morning we called in the morning and they were not open yet golf transportation can only be arranged every hour my husband had to walk back from the golf course with his clubs because royal service does not pick you up we did not see any plus in royal service we usually stay at iberostar lindo or the grand and this place could not compare it was a waiste of money i would recommend this place only to families because they did have a nice children 's area this is not a quiet or romantic resort if you are going on your first all inclusive you will most likely enjoy the resort but if you have been to an iberostar property in the mayan riviera do not bother with this property 
some good  my family  i stayed for 1 week as part of a large group ( part business ) out of the 100 or so of us , some had problems w/ their rooms  others were ok there are a few good points about this place the beach  scenery is great , but of course this is not something the hotel made 2) landscaping  grounds were neat  clean  lush there is a lot of staff around to take care of things everywhere you turn there is someone in a uniform passing most of the staff seems to be happy go lucky people ( which cuts both ways when working ) the not so great features are :1) some front desk  bartend staff have a habit of initially ignoring you when they see you coming up both my wife  i commented on this they also have what i consider the worst habit of using their cell phones while working ( both talking  text message )  you are right in front of them waiting 2) our room was in the older part of the resort , which always smelled like there is a sewage leak somewhere our room was fairly clean  most things worked properly , but the quality of construction was lacking  the tub really needed to be replaced a few people in our party did have leaks coming into their room from the toilet above them  had to be moved even though our room was right next to the pool closest to the front lobby area , we were told later on that we were not allowed to use it because it was for the royal service guests this was not communicated to us before when we asked if we could be moved to another room closer to the pools we could use ( we had our 7 year w/ us ) one front desk person told us he would move us but it would be a higher rate he said the reason we got the room we have was because they were told to keep our group together later we find out this was completely untrue because our group was all spread out , even at the other end of the resort which they did not want a different front desk person we talked to the next day ( w/o knowledge of what we knew ) was perfectly fine to move us w/o charge this  other examples indicate the staff has a tendency to tell you whatever is convenient for them the meals  drinks are all inclusive but it seems they are more geared toward quantity rather than quality the default meal is at the buffets ,  it 's actually not bad w/ a fair selection of different items , especially good if you have small children the restaurant system make you jump through hoops to eat at the a la carte restaurants do not bother w/ them because you can find better  more authentic stuff at any american suburban strip mall restaurant i am not a drinker but even i could tell it was cheap stuff ( i grew up working in restaurants  tended bar in college ) their system of diesel trolley  gas powered golf carts to get you around will get you there but there were so many carts  staff on mopeds zipping around that you were constantly in danger of being run over it also made so much fumes that it ruins the fresh air you might have enjoyed if you are a big drinker  big eater  just want to lounge around the pool or beach it might be a good value but it wasn?? for me 
terrible service , inconsistent food , all - in - all a horrible experience if you are looking for excellent service , great food , and management that is responsive to your needs , this is not the place for you i heard some good things about punta cana and my ta highly recommended this resort the nightmare started at check - in , while we were kept waiting over an hour just to register it went downhill from there the service was extremely spotty while some of the workers were wonderful , the hotel management was extremely rude and arrogant do not expect to get reservations in any restaurants unless you tip one of the workers to make one for you the kicker when when my husband broke his foot on the property , and management did absolutely nothing to help us or make our stay easier in fact , they made him walk close to a mile , with a broken toe , to medical services the management never provided the ride they promised , and any worker in a golf cart he tried to flag down would not give him a ride because he had a wrong color bracelet on meanwhile , this man is in excruciating pain what kind of people are these the food was good at some meals , inedible at others my daughter 's room was infested with 100s of tiny ants they were in the bed , in the bathroom , in her clothes , everywhere and the management gave us nothing but arguments when we wanted to move unless you are staying in the royal service expect nothing better than 2- star treatment and even the royal service , while better , was inconsistent some rooms had bathrobes , others none we did not get the daily newspaper , suite treats or turndown service promised if you complain to management you get lip service - - if you 're lucky usually , you get an argument to say the service was deplorable is an understatement i am extremely sorry i listened to my ta 's recommendation to book this resort and i am telling everyone i can to never , never travel to this resort please save your money in case you are thinking i am being fussy , i spoke to 3 other american couples ( one from texas , one from philadelphia , and another from nj ) who had the same complaints we had while the surroundings were pretty and the spa was fabulous , none of none of us would ever , ever stay there again 
beware dates visited melia caribe tropical 6/19/08 until 6/27/08 on my urging my wife booked our trip through travelocity for the two of us and our three children and my brother who had his own room immediately upon our arrival to the resort the employees at the concierge desk were very eager to help us make dinner reservations for that night and in return we attend a 90 minute presentation of a sol melia vacation club that night we ate at the guarapo the dominican restaurant which was very good as were all the restaurants the problem was getting a reservation dinner reservations are obtained by calling ext 6313 after 9 am but by the time you get through at around 9:15 am everthing was taken so you would need to call at 1:30 pm to see if there were any cancellations so instead of enjoying yourself at the beach or pool you needed to be worried about getting back to the room to call the problem with the reservations for dinner goes back to the sol melia vacation club as the employees use it as a way to get you to go in exchange for dinner reservations they get points for referring guests we went to the presentation on the third day of our stay after becoming friendly with guillermo one of the towel boys at the pool the presentation actually took around three hours in which they took us to there other resorts which were beautiful but we did not wish to purchase the membership my brother was actually confronted by the concierge who had originally had scheduled the presentation he is known as erasmo com he stopped my brother in the lobby and questioned him as to why we had gone to the presentation after he had made dinner reservations for us my brother did not answer this employee but called guest relations and spoke to maralys and told her what had happened and she was very apologetic and would look into it and sent a fruit platter and a bottle of rum to both of our rooms which was a nice gesture but not needed if the employees would just do there job speaking of empolyees who do there job well was mario the bartender at the bar he was fantastic there were many others who are very eager to please like i said before the restaurants capri ( seafood ) , guarapo ( dominican ) , hokkaido ( japanese ) , ma maison ( french ) were excellent except that my daughter got sick the night after eating in the french restaurant ( she threw up twice ) the gondola ( italian ) was ok and the a/c was broken so it was warm in the restaurant as far as our room was concerned the a/c was never cold enough the maid would turn off the electricity in the room after cleaning it so when we would come in from the beach/pool we would have to turn it on by turning the card around upon entering the room i needed to spend 30 minutes every evening killing the mosquitoes , i also spent alot of time in the bathroom flushing the toilet as there was not alot of water pressure i finally figured it out and found a kids sand bucket at the pool and would fill that with water and use it to flush i actually thought about leaving after our third or fourth day there we were so happy to have our bracelets for the resort cut off this morning after check out and to get home there is no place like home 
we traveled with another couple to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and upgraded to junior service , which we never received upon arrival we were dropped at the main entrance and never told to go the the proper check - in area , our suite door did not lock and someone walk into our room , we had daily problems with our bathroom that required maintance and gave us many sleepless nights , pillows and wash cloths had to be requested daily and the food talks wtih the manager did not help golf was part of our package and the only tee times available were 12 noon or later i would not recommend this resort to anyone our travel agent has been trying to resolve somes issues with the resort since dec 07 and has had no luck very poor client service 
great 4 family of five we visited melia with our 3 kids (16, 9  5) and our friends and their 2 kids (11  7) , after having stayed at paradisus punta cana with just us two couples the year before we got family jr suites , which are right by the beach and pool you cannot go wrong if you end up in buildings 1-3 we were supposed to have buckets and pails waiting in the room as a welcome gift for the kids as part of the family suite booking , but neither our kids or our friends got them after a few calls and promises that they would be sent there was also a scheduled kid gift/activity scheduled in the children 's area that we showed up for , but no one was there while i never use childcare , our kids did get to sit in on a magic show they had , and i did see the caregivers taking the kids all around the property for lunch , feeding the peacocks , swimming etal my age ranges were pretty well engaged with the things offered on property as well , but be forewarned you will have to pay for some of the key activities they will want to do the sky ropes course will cost you 10 bucks american , the euro bungy another 6 bucks , figure another 6 bucks for the climbing wall , and there is a huge 2 story slide on the beach that will run you 2 bucks for 3 slides , and they will also take the kids horseback riding for 10 bucks all those extras initially rubbed me the wrong way since i thought everything should 've been included in a family all inclusive , but what are ya gonna do just be ready to pony up at least 32 to 50 bucks per kid if you plan to let them do it all - and they will want to the only included activities they did were the pedal boats and canoes , which were fun and easy to book although there were volleyball nets , they wanted my friend to pay for a ball i must interject here that paradisus was superior in this area , as they offered everything from the balls to organizing the games , to basketballs , playing cards , books , etc you also get free horseback riding , scuba lesson and one free scuba dive there along with all your nonmotorized watersports we just could not go there with our family of five like we could at melia , or else we would have returned or tried palma real , their higher end property located right next to melia paradisus has all of its restaurants near the beach , whereas melia 's restaurants are all back at the lobby a good walk away the trains were regular , but the walk was not bad to me the food quality , variety and quantity was much better at the paradisus the buffet at paradisus had a better selection and was partially indoors so you did not have the invasion of flies like you had at melia 's outdoor restaurant by the beach also , at paradisus my hungry man was able to order two entrees for dinner , which they would not allow at melia and good luck on getting your dinner reservations at melia the property was barely half full when we were there , but it was a lot of work to get into a restaurant you wanted versus what they had left by just 9:30 am maybe those in royal service did not have this problem , because they have someone make their reservation and get first dibs , but those rooms are also far away from the beach remember , the family suites are the best - close to beach , spa/gym and pool ) as for the nightly shows , take your kids to the flintstones show and disco they have , but you may not want to take them to the adult shows they were a bit racy in spots we brought along a grandma who kept the kids while we went out to the shows and dancing - they have live music in the lobbies and beds you can lay in and tables to sit at oh , speaking of racy shows , also be aware that women go topless on the beach , and a few around the pool at most , however , this drew a put those things away , there are children here from my 11 year old godson - hilarious should you leave the kids in - room at night , there are english children 's channels and playstation ( i think you have to rent these games , but if you bring your own , and your own controllers , you may not have to bother to pay the resort yet another extra ) to sum up , the food was so - so , much better at paradisus it is a place where a family of five can stay in one room , which is hard to find , and there is a good amount for younger and older kids to do ( although the teen nightclub was always empty ) nevertheless , i would recommend paradisus punta cana over melia if you do not need room for five no matter what you choose , you absolutely cannot go wrong with the beautiful beach 
one time only and not again late check in , only one person at the front desk room requested was not ready gave us another room the room was dirty and had roaches maintenance showed up late afternoon to spray the room we were always short of towels and one day the housekeeper forgot the toilet tissue too , so we had to call for service housekeepers do not vaccumm the rooms , they just sweep and mop there was hair every where one day they forgot to turn the room , so we had to call for service again each housekeeper carries 16 rooms per day the steam room was out of service , the sauna did not work and the jacuzzi was cold and dirty the attendant answer was we are waiting for parts to complete repairs we had to go barcelo palace resort next door for spa services and for half of the price dinner reservations are very limited and you will be lucky if someone answers the phone after 9am every day the food overall is good but not great if you do not get a dinner reservation , then you will end up eating at the market place buffet , and good luck again very expensive for the quality of service and condition of the course do not even try the practice range , the balls are so hard and heavy that my #5 club broke on impact during practice i brought my son 's and mine clubs in one bag but the attendant tried to force me to rent another bag so the ranger would not get upset all they want is your money the golf shop was selling 3 balls for us$16 i came fully prepared to have a good time with my son but it was hell in paradise , employees had no sense of customer service whatsoever , all they wanted was to sell us more and more poor services i got upset and left the course but fully refunded the entire resort personnel is in vacation packages sales and you feel under constant pressure during your stay the sales personnel also enjoy the breakfast buffet with the resort guests and they not even say good morning to you but they want your money big time very poor management this experience was a one time only and not again 
nice place , skip the food we just stayed at melia caribe for our honeymoon the resort was gorgeous marble floors throughout the lobby very friendly staff watch out , because they will all try to get you to take an invitation to meet with them at a later time for a information session about becoming a member they will not leave you alone all week besides that , the staff was great we had a royal service suite i have not been there in a regular room , but i am guessing that it was worth it having the royal service our room was a small apartment , with a huge bed , a private porch , two plasma tv 's , a living room , a kitchen ( full ) , and jacuzzi and a beautiful bathroom the whole apartment has marble floors the maids come to the room twice a day ( never at times when we were in the room ) the come once in the morning to clean and make up the bed they come again while we are gone for dinner to turn down the bed the beach a about a 10 minute walk from our room we had the option to either walk , or flag down one of many golf carts driven by service staff to take you to the beach they also have a 'train ' that constantly goes around the resort that you can take the beach has a section that is private to royal service guests it is quiet there are cocktail servers that come around to you at the beach , or you can walk up to the bar on the beach yourself oh , by the way , be prepared to see many women topless on the beach there is also a private pool area for royal service members we did not like this one as much as the other pools , because it was too quiet with not enough going on the upside of the private pool is there is a complimentary snack bar now , the negative if you are thinking about purchasing all - inclusive the breakfast and lunch buffets were equivalent to a college cafeteria buffet there are just a few dominican food items available , and they are not very good at breakfast , the rest is just regular breakfast food at lunch , there is a decent variety of items , but again , it is the quality of a cheap buffet if you want some juice with your breakfast , they have a great selection , but it is not kept cold , so enjoy a warm glass of oj at the gabi club ( royal service pool area ) you can get comp food at the snack bar i would be wary of the hamburgers they cook them ahead of time and keep them in a pan filled with hot water until ordered there are 8 or 9 different restaurants on the resort , all with a different theme american , dominican , thai , japanese ( teppanyaki ) , mexican , italian , french and so on do not get excited i would equate this food to a frozen dinner at best even the dominican restaurant was bad i was excited to go there so i could have some real dominican food , but not so much even american food how can you mess that up i was unsure whether i wanted salmon or a regular cheeseburger , so i got both the salmon smelled and tasted sooooo fishy i could not take more than one bite for fear of getting sick so i turned to the burger i think that this burger was cooked the same way as the one at the gabi club oh , and you need to have reservations for each restaurant why , i dont know because the restaurants were more than half empty each night at 7:30 when we went in what happens if you get there early , you ask sorry , your reservation is not until 7:30 with all of the empty tables , they will not let you sit early and when you do get sat , the restaurant service is not so great eventually someone will fill your water , and then someone else will come up and take your order of the week we were there , twice they got our order wrong the last night of our stay , we decided to go eat at hard rock cafe instead because we could not stand it anymore the hard rock is in a mall on the resort grounds , along with tony romas , a sushi place and a pizza place so there are options nearby if you do not wanna eat the nasty food at the resort great place , bad food it is worth it as long as you dont get excited about the food 
bitter sweet i visited this resort for a wedding in may 2008 it was great with clean , beautiful beaches and pools the drinks could 've been a little stronger , but to each his own many restaurants to choose from and plenty of activities my disappointment came when i returned home and found out my bank account had been overdrawn over $1000 to various gas stations in texas ( i live in indiana ) ok , so maybe a tourist , like myself , got the best of me until it was brought to our attention that at total of 8 people from our group were also victims of fraud the only thing we all had in common in using our cards was the resort itself most horrible , i never used my card at the resort , however , they did have my information on file when i booked my stay i thought it was odd that i was not asked for a card for incidentals - they already had it and , so did other people , apparently also , the only time the cards were used were at the resort only - we mostly used cash for the duration of our trip 
my third time = no fluke three melias on one campus : paradisias palma real ( $$$$$ ) , melia ( $$$ ) , and melia tropical ( $$$ ) stayed at them all 2 weeks each , w/in one year ( wife lives there ) in brief , paradisus is same with more beauty , newer , and more cost melia and tropical are interchangeable , same staff , interchangeable lobbys the good : awesome room air conditioners , very nice furnishings , pool , pool bar , beach the select , correct or regret : the buffet areas are between poor and awesome the buffet close to the melia lobby is all to order and super the buffets near the beach are poor at best and deal with volume not quality the bad : restaurants freq have mysterious air conditioner failures the hotel design is to group rooms in more or less 12 rooms w/ a common tiled entry area but the maids and security use this area to talk , scream , and basically socialize away from the eye of their supervisors this area resonates the slightest noise into each room with volume we could never sleep past 8:30am ever it is a very loud morning hotel if that matters to you also , our group had several attractive women and the staff ( which had way too many guys standing around ) stared , whistled , and made high school like sexual facial expressions a beautiful hotel that poorly manages it 's oversexed , underworked excessive personnel 
stay away comfortable is not the word to be used to describe this place it is true that the resort has grounds are well cared for the lobbies and marketplace are nice as well and that is where the positives ended for me beware : the trains that take you around spew black clouds of nasty smoke and so do the little mopeds that all the staff ride around on the stench and noise is really bad , i??e never been to a place so gassed and smelly in canada or us the sidewalks in the alleys are covered in oil so if you are not jumping side to side to give way to passing vehicles while covering your nose you are still forced to smell all the oil that?? evaporating under the sun the beach stinks of gasoline too because of all the speedboats constantly going by and a little inflatable flying boat the washrooms are far from the beach with all the logical consequences and the calm standing waters of the ocean make it nastier you have to wear a shirt , shorts and sandals in the beach buffets so if your bathing suit is still damp and you are hungry you again have to be inconvenienced one way or the other the rooms are old and dated and if you don?? give a bribe your room will probably face a very busy road with roaring smelly vehicles and a train that rings its bell at all hours of day or night you are given each one bath towel so if you take a shower in the evening be prepared to use the same old wet towel in the morning and what genius thought of putting the only hooks in the bathroom right over a bide the food was mediocre as expected the service was the same ? dominicans are a long way from understanding what customer service is asking 3 different people for a drink at breakfast and being reprimanded for being late for dinner ( what happened to the ??ominican time? ) because of an issue with a door lock is not enjoyable so a 2 -3 star resort at best as far as i am concerned 
will not return my husband and i stayed at the resort 4/9 - 4/13 and opted for the royal service package to start this review on a positive note , the property and grounds are well - kept and the royal service pool was convenient and nice everything else was very disappointing we found two huge cockroaches in our royal master suite on consecutive days the food was horrible and to top it off , both my husband and i got sick from something we ate which lasted for 3 days suffice to say , we will not be returning to this resort 
good value for an all inclusive we stayed at the melia tropical during the week of march 17, 2008 our arrangements were made through an interline travel agency ( we are airline employees ) , so we got a wonderful deal for three of us ( couple and 14 yr old daughter ) upon our arrival at the d punta cana airport , you immediately sense that they will try to squeeze all the money possible out of you , starting with the pictures with two costumed women at the airport we quickly refused them , and they did not seem to appreciate our bluntness much , nonetheless , we are glad we did it was a $25 ride to the hotel , passing through some slums and finally arriving at this man made jungle they call the melia conglomeration of resorts we got to the lobby of the hotel , and immeidately someone accosted us to try to talk us into the famous '90 min presentation i knew they were going to do this , so again , i immediately refused ( they did not like my reply , but it did not matter to us ) my husband checked us all in , and again , another person - - pretending they wanted t show us the grounds - - diverted us to another desk where three men were waiting to sell us on their timeshare presentation i stepped in , and told them again , that we did not come here to do any of that , i bluntly told them that we wanted to be left alone and not bothered , as our vacation was our own family time , not time for them one of the men ( he had very light skin features and blonde , almost bleached hair , really did not like my attitude , i could tell , but it worked , because they left us alone for the rest of the week ) we speak fluent spanish , and i think that also helped set them straight nonetheless , by this time it was well past 3pm and our room was not ready ( no surprise ) so we headed to the marketplace buffet for lunch we were immediately surrounded by a bevy of waiters trying to vie for our attention and tips we did bring about $250 in singles , which , i have to say , went a long way getting us better service our room was finally ready at about 5:30pm ( this was worse than mexico , folks ) but we found it to be spacious and comfortable , although it had virtually no drawer space and the beds were hard and uncomfortable and soooo small we had two beds which were more twin size than full size ( the spaniards apparently use smaller beds than us americans ) our room was located near the beach and the beachside grill so it was very convenient we never got to use the beach as the waves were very violent and the water arctic cold the beautiful swimming pool was equally cold and we really just sat by the pool all week long my husband had to get up at 6am every day to put a towel on some poolside chairs in order to secure us a place and even with that , most chairs were taken by 6am i think people just left their towels there overnight and never removed them in order to secure the best poolside spots we only met another family from the us while we were there , everyone was from europe , canada or another part of the world in essence , it was nice , because we enjoy the dialogue and exchange with other cultures when we travel around the world , but be warned that the hotel caters to europeans , allowing them to smoke everywhere and also go topless we knew of these two situations beforehand , so were prepared we are not smokers , but everywhere we went there were people smoking , even young teenagers , all we had to do was move to another side of the restaurant , lounge or wherever we happened to be there was also no apparent drinking age minimum , so for those of you who are sensitive to this issue , be warned as for the dining , we did enjoy the dominican restaurant , the american restaurant and the seafood restaurant the menus are very , very small and llimited , and yes , the food is no 5- star quality , but remember that you are in an all inclusive facility and you get what you pay for we did not expect top quality dining , but we thought the offerings were reasonably presented and prepared the beverages were the downside , for us their local rums , horrible spaniard wines , and other non - brand - name spirits were appalling we chose to buy better bottles of wine from their wine list ( at a cost , of course ) and better brands of spirits what is included in their beverages is absolutely terrible so if you enjoy a good bottle of wine or a properly prepared cocktail , prepare to shell out a few dollars , as these luxuries are not included we spent a lot of time at their bar that is next to the show venue , and we have to say that the bartenders were wonderful , warm people one of them , by the name of jesus , was terrific , and we would return to him night after night he was the highlight of the bar area as for the nightly shows , they were entertaining and enjoyable it is not las vegas , but they truly try their best to entertain you , so we really appreciated that and yes , someone prior to us in these critiques said that 'one does not really know what is going on as far as activities , shows , etc because nothing is posted that is correct , there is really no notification provided to guests , other than a small mural/board next to the train stop with limited information i almost forgot to talk about the fact that we became very familiar with using the number '3000' while were guests at the hotel you see , when you need to make a reservation , ask for extra towels , complain about something , or anything in the world , you pick up your room phone and dial 3000 it seems to be the magic number you cannot dial individual departments for assistance , so time after time , we got the same indifferent women operators at extension 3000 on another note , please be aware that there is no room service in this part of the resort and also no internet we - - fortunately - - had our laptop with us , and were able to buy some air time at their less - than - stellar so - called business center for a reasonable amount however , internet connection there is so bad that we used up most of our air time trying to connect to the internet also , be aware of the 'friendly ' folks running around the hotel with parrots , monkeys and other little creatures they are not sharing their animals with you , they are trying to take your picture so that they can sell them to you at $10 each ( cash only , by the way ) everywhere you turn , someone is trying to make a dime off of you even one evening , when we were strolling through an outdoor little market that some vendors had set up at the hotel , it was nauseating to even walk through it , , someone was constantly trying to sell you whatever they had , even though i told them clearly that we were just browsing we did not purchase anything from them , instead , we picked up a few small things at the hotel 's souvenir shop , and still spent over $160 in random little things very , very expensive i have to say the grounds of the hotel are beautiful , and yes , it is huge , and you will generally use the train to get around many of the employees were warm and attentive , and i also have to agree with a previous post that the girls who work at the marketplace grill are cold and not very nice we found dominican men to be much more friendly thant he women , most of the women have an air of superiority and arrogance about them , so we generally ignored them the only women that were pleasant were the room maids , they were respectful and very cordial and so prompt whenever you needed something for the room i am giving the resort a 3 star because we enjoyed the facilties and the experience , and for the value that we paid , we truly got a good vacation it is not a 4 or 5 star resort , but most of the employees try hard to welcome you and make you feel comfortable , and folks , remember , this is a very poor country with limited resources , and they do the best they can under the circumstances 
not what we expected , but not bad either we just returned from a trip to punta cana , at the melia caribe where we spent 7 nights with our three teenage children april 4 through the 11th after looking at several reviews on trip advisor , we booked this trip in july of 2007 overall , our trip was good there were many positive aspects along with our trip along with some disappointments mostly pertaining to the poor service at the resort we arrived late in the afternoon due to a 3 hour flight delay on our flight out of atlanta to punta cana due to equipment issues with the plane we arrived at the melia around 5pm to our surprise , there were not many people checking in at that time , but front desk service was extremely slow we did not opt for royal service , but the man who checked us in sent us over to vip to check - in when we arrived at the vip lounge check - in desk , there was a great deal of confusion and we were sent back over to the regular check - in counter we had requested a king room for ourselves and also a room with two double beds for the 3 teens when the reservation was booked back in july , we had made this request and also requested the rooms were in the same building this request had been guaranteed since the reservation was made eight months prior to traveling they pulled the reservation and our room was in building 9 and the teens were located in building 12 the response was that that was the best they could do i told them we wouldn?? accept that room placement so they started working on trying to find two rooms in the same building after approximately 45 minutes they found two rooms in building 9? however , when we went to those rooms , we found they both had king beds which would not work so??nother 15 minute trip back to the front desk and another hour to get us two rooms in the same building one with a king and one with two double beds when we got the keys , i went to the bell cap and clearly marked on each bag?? airline tag where each bag was to go we went to the rooms to freshen up and make a run at the buffets after dinner , i checked with the bellman to see if the bags were delivered to the room and he couldn?? tell me finally after about a half hour , he confirmed the bags were delivered as for the resort , the grounds were very immaculate and well - kept there was an abundance of trees , exotic foliage , flowers , birds and other wildlife it was most likely the most beautiful resort we ever visited the property itself , including the lobby and rooms were well kept and very clean the lobby and dining areas were beautiful and kept very clean the rooms were a little dated , but overall were clean and very well kept with a few exceptions the safe in the teen?? room did not work and it took three days to get it fixed there were two days where we had to call service because the shower in their bath did not work the last few days , condensation from the vent in their room dripped quite a bit it was more of an issue with the air conditioning running all of the time due to the heat and was probably working harder than usual housekeeping could have been a little more consistent in the sense there were a couple of days where we had to call for towels or water and pop for the mini fridges finally , we found the closet in each building where the pop and water were stored and filled the mini fridges ourselves the dining and food was quite good for an all inclusive even the three buffets that we ate at were good and had a lot of variety and daily changes to the offerings which is not the norm for buffets at an all - inclusive wait staff at the buffets was not very good and usually you had to either wait ten minutes for drinks or request them our experience at the ala cartes was very good we dined at the japanese , dominican , mexican , thai / asian , american grille the seafood and the french restaurants and all were very good to excellent the food was very flavorful and there was a nice variety of choices on all of the menus our three favorites were the japanese , seafood and the thai restaurants the japanese restaurant was quite entertaining as well , and the service outstanding as for reservations for the al cartes , be prepared to dial repeatedly beginning at 9 am to get through and then find that most of the prime time slots are already gone especially with the popular restaurants such as the japanese you can make reservations for the current evening that morning and also for the next evening , so we usually lined up a couple of evenings at a time you can call after 1:30 pm each day and check on cancellations and that helped us on a couple of days there is an abundance of bars on the property and the bar and wait staff at all bars were friendly and worked hard to keep you happy drinks were not great , but not entirely bad either the beer on tap was presidente from the dominican republic which was good the frozen drinks were dispensed from a frozen drink machine in a cup on top of rum , tequila , or other alcohol often , they were very runny , especially late in the day after the heat took its toll on the machines but overall the drinks were good and they were always in abundance our only disappointment regarding the bars and drinks was that there was no bar at the beach if you were at the beach and wanted to drink , you had to walk to one of the pools which was a 5 minute walk the pools were very spacious in size and kept very clean the two pools closest to the beach had a lot of chairs available as well as a swim up bar at each the pool on the tropical side tended to have a lot of young children there because of the close proximity to the flintstones part of the resort the tropical side had more adults there there was a lack of organized activity at the pools for teens and adults such as water volleyball , etc so that was somewhat disappointing the beach was out of this world it was very large with trees and beautiful white sand there were an abundance of lounge chairs on the beach along with a couple of beach volleyball and bocce courts stay away from the vendors on the beach as there are better buys on the same items at the mall in front of the resort or at the local market scuba caribe has a location on the beach at the resort and can offer some options that the tour operators in the resort lobby do not , such as a two hour scuba trip to the reef , and these trips are less expensive than booking through the guys in the lobby there was nightly entertainment each night including a show each night at the caribe there was also live music and/or karaoke each evening it was pretty difficult to be bored at this resort as there were many options to choose from the golf at el cocotal is very nice and scenic there are 27 holes that are very challenging and many of the holes have a lot of sand on them the golf is free with the package except for the cart which is $35 per person there is regular transportation to the course and back to the resort service at the course , however , is lacking and confusion reigns rampant tee time spacings were often too close and the course usually backed up by the time you started the back nine a round of 5 ? to 6 hours is not uncommon on this course even with a 27 hole layout finally , stay away from the timeshare pimps in the lobby and at the entrance to the buffets by the pools they press hard to get you to go to the 90 minute presentation we had no intentions of going through a presentation , but one of the guys said , just get up after 20 minutes and they??l still give you the $70 gift certificate? overall , our trip experience was good , but not great or what we had expected 
beautiful property april 6 - 10 - melia caribe - royal servicesimmaculate and beautiful grounds just peacocks , flamingos , egrets , woodpeckers , turtles , and beautiful flowers and shrubs took the transportation provided from the airport ( see note below regarding this ) and it was better than expected although when the driver announced melia caribe and we got off , he did not seem to know there was a separate check - in for royal services so we boarded the bus again and was taken to the vip lobby check - in went very smoothly and although we had booked royal services , our room was upgraded as was the other two family members ' rooms we travelled with 5 other adults , with children 13, 9, 3, 15 months and 9 months the adults with the 3 yr and 9 month children had rs one bedroom suite which they felt was a wise choice given it afforded them the much needed space all rooms were very nice and clean the pull out sofa mattresses for sleeping were a bit thin so an adult or teenager might find it uncomfortable pools and beach were wonderful but if you want to get a thatched covered bed by the pool , be prepared to be there before 6a as people tend to place their belongings on the large beds to hold their spot even though they may spend the majority of the day at the beach and only return to the pool later in the day we did not find the on - property transporation any problem and walking was great as it gives you an opportunity to explore the grounds we were approached ( very gently ) by only one timeshare sales person no problem for us the restaurant facilities were very good providing a nice atmosphere loved the gabi restaurant open air experience with a multitude of illuminated candles and stars at night pool bar was very relaxing with nice selection of brands it 's difficult to find out what is going on , parcticularly in the evening ( if anything ) as they do not provide a daily listing of activities we were not aware that the zip line and other things in that particular area are designated for certain times for youngsters and adults and is not open all of the time food was probably the most disappointing the presentation ( eye appeal ) was top notch but the actual food was less than anticipated we ate at the gabi , the international , the seafood ( would not recommend this one ) and the japanese since the japanese is the most highly sought after reservation we looked forward to it it was very entertaining but again , not really anything outstanding just average all in all , you can definitely find something to your liking but do not expect quality or gourmet food the other real issue we had was the fact that we asked for extra pillows ( which they did bring ) however , they took them back the next day when they cleaned the room and we again had to request them this happend two days in a row and we finally decided to hide them so they could not take them back oh , when you arrive at the airport make sure you know which tour operator you are booked with as it can be somewhat confusing to find where you should be boarding your transportation to the hotel all in all , it was a pleasant experience i would have to say it is not 5 star quality due to the food and the lack of communication regarding any activities we never felt there were large amounts of people on the property at any time although i understand it was pretty full 
beautiful grounds - everything else is sub - standard my friends and i planned a 2 week stay at the melia caribe tropical in punta cana through expedia everything was included - transportation to and from , airfare , hotel etc we read many good reviews and some bad ones but decided to go with this one because of the price and the beautiful pictures there was a total of 10 people aged 19-36, 2 singles and 4 couples upon touchdown at the airport , which really looked like a third world airport we were forced to pay $10 per person entry fee for a stamp in our passport , after waiting 2 hours in long lines of all the other people waiting to get that stamp let me tell you - there is no airconditioning and it is very hot and musty in dr after that nightmare , we went on our bus to be driven to the hotel the bus which made about 6 stops , took over 2 hours we went to the rs check - in which bypassed all the lines and they told us we could go straight to the royal service lounge and check in ok we did , but we had to carry our own bags - not something from a 5 star hotel/resort we did not complain upon arriving in the royal service lounge , we were notified that our rooms had been double booked not a big deal as we have experienced this before in even 5 star hotels around the world however , when they could not verify our information and blamed the confusion on us and left us to make our own telephone calls to expedia we flipped out but surprise surprise - we were not the only ones there with the same problem two other couples were arguing with the manager ( a real b **** ) because they were charged for calls they never made and because they had such a terrible time there we waited 4 hours until matters got cleared up and they verified us no apolgy , no discounts or upgrades and we got no compensation in any event , they took our bags to the rooms ( building 5, rooms 5206-5214 if i remeber correctly ) and we got on a golf cart to move 100 feet to the other side of the pool they took the long way in the room , the a/c was off and the room was musty and hot and sticky not 5 star , not even 3 star service before the bell boy put the bags down he had his hand out for money we gave him $1 each - $1 too much that was the start of a bad trip - one that we cut short from two weeks to 9 days here 's the summary - grounds - very clean and beautiful the pools are great the pathways can be very slippery so be careful the grounds are huge you need 20-30 minutes to walk from one side to the other and everywhere is clean they have a trolly train that goes arounf from time to time and you see many workers on motor scooters but they puff black cancer causing smoke into the air rooms - clean sheets and bedding we had 2 small flat screen tv 's which were ok but no so clear and only had 8 channels the bathroom was very big and nicely designed the jaccuzzi bath is large and new the seperate shower w/ glass door was very nice but there was some mold around the bottom tiles and mold around the sink for the most part the room was ok , 4 star the a/c does not work all the time at one time the a/c cut out in the middle of the night and they repaird it by lunch the next day but it still was never cool in the room also it is very humid and sticky so your clothes does not dry - in fact it always feels damp and musty a nice point was the rs has a pillow menu with different pillows but they book quick and you can only get 1 type per room also with royal service they pick you up with golf carts - lol it a joke you would be lucky if you seen one that will pick you up every 5 hours btw , rs gives you a special braclet to wear and when the driver sees this they are supposed to pick you up - most of them just ignore you food - horrible and that is not just my opinion but all of the guests that were with us each of us became sick at least 1 night during the first 4 days - vomiting and diarrhea pepto bismol costs $20 caution - the store there is the biggest rip off ever we ate in : - la gondola - ok italian and the best restaurant there - ma masion - french food gone bad - we probably got sick there - the american grill - terrible - la hacienda - bland , boring and small portions - hokkaido - japanese food thats not real japanese and poor quality - we also got sick from thisservice - we give service 1 star it takes 2 hours to have our door unlocked when the lock battery died value - it rates poor , 1 star we left feeling ripped off the price is good when looking for 5 star service but you really get 2 star service the managers are rude and do not care about you they have no concept of what it means to serve i think part of the problem is they are poor dominicans and they look at americans as rich spoiled brats and they feel they do not have to serve you - - that being said , not everyone was bad some workers actually worked hard and we gave them a $10 per day tip everyone else , from house cleaning to guest services is rude and they only want your money do not go on any excursions we went on a quad excursion for $90 each for a 6 hour tour - what we got was broken quads with non - function brakes that were downright dangerous in the end , we would never go to this hotel or any sol melia resort anywhere in the world after what we went through the whole reason i am writing this is because of this experience and because after writing several letters to complain we got no response from anyone in the actualy hotel - we did get a response from corporate and they gave us a free 3 night stay with any 3 night purchase - thanks but no thanks even if they paid for the entire trip we would say no way jose if you are used to 1 star service this may be an upgrade for you - its 2 star overall including the beautiful grounds avoid this place at all costs if you have experienced other good places around the world this has to be the absolute 2nd worst place ( after world of wonders resort in turkey which takes honors as the worst place on earth ) sol melia , we award you 2nd place for the worst vacation experience ever 
confusion in @ melia we arrived at the resort and we were with 30 other people in our group we booked 6 months in advance so that we could be close together , hopefully in 3 of 4 buildings next to each other when we checked in , we were advised that the hotel overbooked and we would be upgraded to the royal service another family we were with was told the same thing we requested not to be in royal service so we could be close to all our friends who were put in buildings 1,2 and 3, which was at the other end of the resort (25 minute walk ) we were told , that is not possible i told my wife let 's just check it out and we could take the trains or walk to be with the group we went to the room and it was a basic hotel room with a couch and a 13 tv we could not figure out how to work the lights and the bathrron was old and the beds were hard that night in the casino , i spoke to another guest who was in the same situation , but his room was super nice with a jucuzzi and all the upgrades we woke up the next day and decided that we really needed to change rooms ( all are friends had family suites with flat screens and really loved the rooms ) we went to royal service to request the change he took me to the front desk to speak to the manager ( it took 2 hours and they were insulted we wanted to downgrade from the royal service ) they told us that they could put us in building 1 with all of our friends , but the room would not be ready for a few hours we said fine and could they help us with our luggage and have a golf cart pick us up they told us it would not be for a while and it was now around noon that day so we went back to the room and packed it up and dragged five large suitecases passed a wedding cerimony to the lobby for the bellman ( i figured i could do their job for them ) we went back to the beach with our friends and hung out until the room was ready the grounds were beautiful , the food and service were wonderful we tipped really well and the bartenders took care of us and accomodated every request we were close to the pool and beach and it made it really easy for all of us to be together overall this resort was above average and outside of check in , we would recommed to our friends 
not worth it my husband and i have traveled to all inclusive hotels in the past and this one was the worst we chose this hotel because of the kid 's club and royal services , but the hotel failed to share some very important details so here they are :1 service and shade : we opted for the royal service due to the numerous complaints regarding reservations issues at the restaurants and towel shortages the rumors where true but even at the royal side we had to make some sacrifices first , you must make your restaurant reservation by 9 a the day before with a vip representative the phone lines are constantly busy , so you will need to do them in person or have a lot of patience second , we found it difficult to find shade near the pool or by the beach to overcome this problem , most people would get up between 5-6 a to reserve a spot using the yellow royal service towels , but this is not guaranteed the official hotel policy is that spots can only be reserved up to an hour so , we found many people taking morning naps by the pool and beach we also found it necessary to pay off the guards and attendants in order for the spaces to be assured and safe we even witnessed a fight on the royal service beach regarding this issue management had to be called in to alleviate the problem caused by overbooking finally and most importantly , the service was less than royal except at the gabi , the service at the other restaurants was marginal at best the servers will forget to offer you drinks , mention the a la cart options , forget to close the kitchen doors , forget items you have ordered , and take an excessive amount of time they will also refuse to let you take food out of the restaurant ( hotel policy ) the food , although abundant , was fair at best the wine is not included , except for a local brand that was awful the kid 's club : does not open till 10:00 a opening and drop off times vary day to day it took most parents 20 minutes to drop off their kids drop off sometimes changes location to the restaurant by the beach or the camp grounds signs communicating the drop of changes are faded and unclear the kids club for the younger population ( i 3 year olds ) does not serve them lunch nor snacks you must pick up your child , feed them , and return this is not a big problem if you are on the caribe side or if you do not plan to go on any activities such as tours , snorkling , para - sailing , etc but , if you are on the royal service beach/side or tropical side of the hotel , it will take you 10-15 minutes walking by the beach or 30 minutes through the gardens/trains to drop off/pick up your child each time in addition , the 3 year olds stay inside all the time they watch tv and color they do not take the younger kids on strolls nor to a playground the playground that you see on the web site does not exist because it is being replaced right now they have a hot slab of cement surrounded by sand now , it is true that the 5 -9 year old camp side is better ana , the head camp coordinator is very sweet they get served lunch and take part in varied activities but , be aware , if you plan to pick up your child prior to the 5 p pick up time , you will be challenged to find them also , they refused to apply sun lotion on my child when she asked they also did not remind her to put on a shirt while in the pool as we specifically requested transportation : if you stay at the royal side , you will be at the point furthest from the beach the hotel offers special royal service carts to take you from the vip lounge to the beach , but not to the caribe side we had to make special arrangements to try to get to the kid 's club from the royal service pool it took us 30 minutes total to get there , and 45 minutes back we do not recommend that you purchase the royal service if you plan to use the kid 's club or if you cannot walk moderately large distances overall , we do not recommend this hotel several local service guides recommended the riu palace hotel instead 
cut it short and flew home - need i say more i arrived on saturday and called my husband and said get me out of here on tuesday - i was able to get a flight home thursday afternoon first off let me start by saying - that if you are the type of person who likes to walk out of their hotel and the pool and beach are right there for you to enjoy - this is not the place for you if you like a place where the staff speaks english cause you do not speak spanish - this is not the place for you if you like to feel as if everyone is treated equally and not by the color of the resort bracelet you wear - this place is not for you if you want to leisurely walk around the resort ( mind you this place is huge - i could of used a helicopter to take me from the lobby to my room ) - you will need to constantly look over your shoulder for the oncoming 2 car trolley train , mopeds ( used by staff ) , golf carts and delivery trucks , maintenance trucks etc and while you are dodging these vehicles hold your breath cause the diesel smell stays with you all day and can give you terrible headaches also trying to keep my 5 year old in check while these vehicles were constantly going by was a hassle in itself this vacation was more work and walking then i wanted - i should have just taken my daughter to disney the amount of smokers ( lots of europeans and canadians - nothing against them of course ) its in my opinion from what i have seen , they have no regard for children and second hand smoke - they will come and sit right down next you with not a care in the world for anybody??

stay away our family traveled together to melia caribe and we booked 4 rooms at the hotel through austin travel in melville ny you can read on , but i highly recommend that you do not book your vacation at this resort and do not ever use austin travel in melville ny we booked 2 doubles and 2 kings , non - smoking check in took over one hour and we received 3 doubles and 1 king , all in building 19, which is actually one building with half the rooms accessible from separate entrances and therefore not 4 rooms together we were told by guest services that room requests ( being together in non - smoking ) is only a request , not a guarantee my family and i travel extensively and i 've never heard that a non - smoking room cannot be guaranteed after much complaining we settled on getting rid of the smoking room and were told it was a king when we arrived at the room it was a double guest services told us their computer showed it as a king and that room services must have switched the beds and not updated the computers while all of this was going on , our luggage was somehow lost on the property after waiting 3 hours and missing the entire afternoon , i had to jump in a van with the bell captain to track down our luggage when we finally found it , there was some kind of red liquid that had spilled on several suit cases and leaked through thankfully there was not any damage to the clothes our next adventure started the next morning when we arrived at the beach the water was very rough and the hotel understandably cancelled all of the water activities and beach activities this meant that the only all - inclusive day activities would take place at the pool and these amounted to playing board games no pool volleyball or any other type of pool games just a we 're sorry but the beach activities have been cancelled no activities except the camps for children under 10 kids over 10 were out of luck except for the challenging climbing wall , zip line , hanging bridges and super jumper , which come at an extra cost ( the website does not tell you this ) after 2 days of complaints the staff opened limited beach activities and the days started to get better but we 're the guests and the hotel should have alternatives when the beach ca not be used dinner reservations experience was similar to other reviews i 've seen the resort ca not accommodate everyone in their a la carte restaurants so if you ca not get through at 8 am in the morning , you will be eating at the buffets unless you spend more for their royal service all - inclusive resort with 2 classes of guests what 's so all - inclusive its more exclusive i could go on , but the bottom line is that the resort does not know what they are doing and the staff does not care there are better places , like cozumel , where you can enjoy a truly all - inclusive family vacation 
a total nightmare i have stayed and enjoyed melia resorts in varadero , playa conchal , cancun , and cabo san lucas my family and i had always been pleased with the level of service and quality at each of these locations until we went to the caribe tropical we had decided , along with two other couples , to stay at the melia caribe tropical afetr a stay next door at the paradisus and booked the rooms directly on their website in january when we arrived at the melia caribe , we were informed by the front desk that they were going to send us to an ??pgraded? room at their property on the golf course located across the road but in fact was at least 4 km from the beach i immediately refused and stated that i had reserved with my credit card and since i don?? golf , i wanted to stay in the property for which i reserved the front desk staff then informed us that this was my only choice and that everything else was solidly booked i then requested to speak with a manager and the reception manager met with us and explained that the golf facilities are part of the hotel and that it isn?? far from the beach and it?? an ??pgraded? room from what we were going to get we really weren?? happy about this but didn?? want this to ruin our otherwise great experience at the paradisus so we relented and agreed to go over and take a look the front desk then took my credit card and ??hecked us in? to the hotel and they then sent us over to the golf suites unfortunately , this is where our nightmare begins as we arrived there , i immediately realized that this was not part of the hotel in fact , we had to ??heck in? again at the golf suites hotel which had nothing to do with the melia caribe worst yet and to our horror , the staff explained that we now had to share the condo with another couple and decide who would take the 1 room with a double bed and who would take the room with 2 single beds i couldn?? believe that we were lied to and immediately demanded to be taken back to the melia caribe again , back at the melia caribe , i asked to speak with the hotel manager instead of the front desk manager and was told that nobody other than sergio was available i explained to the front desk attendant that the facilities next door are not an ??pgrade? asked to go back to the paradisus he then boldly told me that the paradisus is also over - booked and that if i didn?? take the location at the golf suites , they would give it to someone else and my wife and i could sleep on the floor of the hotel i then asked if i could use the internet to perhaps find another hotel in punta cana that could accommodate us they didn?? want to allow us at first but then sergio ushered us into an office so i could check for another location there was no availability in the vicinity so i asked if sergio could call but he explained to me that they don?? really speak with other chains and really had no other way of accommodating us so the condo at the golf suites was our only alternative again , we always felt that nobody ever wanted to help us and that we were on our own to fend for ourselves i could not believe that they can call the golf suites an ??pgrade? the condo was an old simple location with cheap furniture and 2 small rooms ? 1 with a double bed and the other with 2 single beds it was not clean , the bathroom shower would go from hot to cold and you couldn?? control the temperature , and the hotel was quick to tell us that nothing was included except for a ??ontinental? breakfast in the morning i asked the front desk how much they charge for the condo and they told me $170 so now , the melia caribe is charging me $443 00us and the other couple $443 00us per night so the hotel is making $846 per night for a condo that costs $170 this is utterly unethical and i can?? believe that would rip - off and treat people this way once we returned home , i sent a letter to their head office in spain only to receive a notice from the general director in punta cana that i should have known that they were overbooked i guess now guests should know in advance that a hotel chain is incompetent as to overbook and then gouge the porr guests if you 're lucky to not get bumped out of a room and do not mind the massive property to get around , then this hotel may be right for you i can ceratinly say that i will never stay at another one of their properties agai 
enjoyed the beach and food just returned from punta cana within the last week from our stay at the melia caribe this was our second stay , we had been their three years before having advised the resort previously we were repeat customers , uponn our arrival at the resort , we were treated with great urgency and check in was done within a half hour their were 43 people on our bus that arrived at the same time and the resort was more then ready for them the golf was great , the food was great the resort was a big quiet place when we were there three years ago but most people must have found out it has become a family resort with to many parents not addressing their childrens behaviour way to much smoking on the beach , in food areas and all over the place in addition , what was a quiet evening for a walk on the cobblestone , is now a maze of three trains , mini bikes and a large fleet of golf carts what was once a quiet and pleasant resort has now become a business site of activity will not return david in lethbridge 
nice looking resort , but what a disappointment my family and another family booked this trip with the highest of hopes , but were quickly let down upon arrival first off - - let me say that if you do not fall into the sales - pitch trap at the melia , you will be treated as a second - class patron when we first arrived a man name daniel quickly greeted us and promised us dinner reservations and a private golf cart to bring us to dinner being naive guests , we thought this was just the kind of hospitality the melia offered until daniel said that when we had time he would like to show us their club membership by then it was too late so , the first night we had reservations at one of the restaurants , and two golf carts picked us up and whisked us off to what turned out to be a very frustrating dinner with so - so food , and a complete lack of communication the next night , daniel called to see if we needed reservations and a golf cart , to which we agreed but by the next day when daniel realized we had no intention of listening to the sales pitch , he quickly dropped us like a hot potato , and literally ignored us for the rest of the vacation he would not even acknowledge our existence the other problems were the total lack of communication , as well as the complete lack of care that they could not understand us i tried to get by with basic spanish - - but that did not even work if you were not constantly handing out money , you were useless i understand that it 's a very poor country , but come on - - i 'm on vacation and not a cheap one we were staying in a family suite on the tropical side - - villa 1 to be exact every night there was music blasting between the hours of 12 am and 3 am we were told there was nothing they could do about that the food was mediocre at best the best restaurant was hokkaido japanese restaurant - - we were actually so excited because we felt like we were home for a moment good luck getting reservations for $7500, we ate at the buffet 4 out of 7 nights we were also told that there was nothing they could do about that it was not until i finally blew a fit that we got reservations in 2 other restaurants the dominican food one ( gross ) and the mexican one there were ants all over the bathroom and a gigantic roach in the drawers where all of our clothes were i could even deal with that - - it 's the caribbean , but on top of everything else it was just too much the resort is beautiful - - the grounds are spectacular they just fall short in every way of being great if you do not stay in the royal service section , or go to their sales talk , you are nothing to them it 's really sad because we looked forward to this trip for so long , and we were so disappointed in the end we could not wait to get home from day 2 unfortunately , we heard a lot of people screaming and yelling while we were there rooms not available , no reservations in the restaurants , lack of communication , rudeness , we even met a family whose toilet literally exploded and nothing was done about it for hours hopefully we just hit it on a bad week , but we 'll never know because we will never return there 
our family just returned from one week at the melia caribe and tropical i wo not go back the service is completely nonexistent we spent one week trying to get a blanket for my daughter 's bed we have three children so we upgraded to a family suite my husband and i each had single beds ( quite a surprise there was a trundle bed with linen for my boys my daughter was supposed to have the couch but there was not any linens for her we arrived in very late at night and had to wait over an hour with four phone calls just to get her sheets however , we were never to get a blanket we did not have a do not disturb sign so we were often woken up by the housekeeper any special requests , such a late check out can take hours it is extremely difficult to get reservations at the restaurants they had a rule that if you were in a big group , you could only eat at 6:45 or 9:00 p however , the restaurants were always half empty at 7:30 or 8:00 p once , we asked the waiter if he could turn down the air conditioning as it was freezing and he told us that it was not possible it was impossible to change rooms you could easily hear all your neighbors , the insulation was a joke the food was decent , the beach was awesome , the weather fabulous the staff was so unhelpful , it was ridiculous even on check out , they did not even thank us for coming no one , asked us the entire time , if we liked our stay the activities never took place on time or at all after this week , i am afraid to return to the dominican republic a trip advsior member , bloomfield hills , michigan 
faulty towers in the sun not sure where to even start on this hotel just horrible with to many faults we stayed over the new year , being regular travellers to the dr , this is definately not a 5 star hotel i would rate it as a 2-3star the surroundings are very attractive , the beach lovely , the shows good but thats it the hotel was full to capacity , we tried to upgrade on numerous occasions before we went and when we arrived but it was full we had a very long flight and was tired to say the least , we tried to check in , but i dont even think they had a room available for us there was a hustle and bustle going on in spanish we were allocated a room not what we booked but we had no choice then the fun started , we were told to get on the bus given a map and told where to find our room , this place is like a maze the cases would follow between 30 minutes and 90 minutes we walked around for an hour trying to find the room jumping on and off the bus we finally found the room opened the door was not impressed but after reading other reports i was not expecting to much we had two bell boys bring the cases , hung around for a tip and would not leave the room , i would have given a tip if we were shown to our room by them , they was very rude so i decided no tip i showed them the door room : - we looked around the room which was filthy the mirrors was dirty there was crawling insects all up the door frame the patio doors had all hand prints over them , the bathroom was dirty and the whole room stunk of bleach , the dust was thick , i immediately started cleaning the room , we were so tired and wanted to when we went to bed that night i went to lock the patio doors and the lock was on the floor thrown behind the curtain completely out of the wall i called maintenance and waited an hour he fixed it banging and drilling the next morning we awoke to a urine smell , i went to the bathroom and the toilet had leaked all over the floor , i called maintenance back again to fix it my family from england was trying to call the room but the telephone was broken too the whole room needed renovating , i informed my rep the next morning she ask us if we wanted to move rooms but tthen told us the hotel was full i instructed her to get the room cleaned and repaired even when we left the room was still dirty and nothing ever did get done about it the rooms are shabby dull dingy and broken waiting staff  food : - its such a shame i have never seen such miserable staff and they look so unhappy , which is not there fault , this hotel is in need of management direction , the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing , they could not cope with the amount of people booked new years day was a joke it was called we let you have a rest more like let the staff have a rest , there was no staff around everyone was moaning and scrambling for food , which was disgusting left overs from the night before they even made the evening show up from the audience the whole time we was there not one member of staff said hello , how are you , or even a smile the lunchtme buffett , had flies all over the uncleared tables , and birds helping themselves to the buffett dinner time buffet was queing to be seateed and no tables laid out , you plates never cleared from one course to the next traffic around the resort : - this is so dangerous someone is going to get seriously hurt soon with the staff the way they drive around the pathways of a night time share people : - these are so annoying they belong to the hotel and try to get you everywhere you go , it makes the hotel feel very distrusting , the staff need some kind of uniform on so that holiday makers can tell the staff from the timeshare people , they come out in dromes of a night we had a good time while we was there , a holiday is what you make it , and the new years eve beach party was fun , but there is no way in a million years i would return to melia caribe there is so many other lovely hotels in punta cana , and this hotel is not good value for money 
horrible service and food but a beautiful property it took us over 1 hour to check into this hotel even with the royal service - premium check in the staff is extremely unfriendly and unhelpful at the royal service pool , there are typically 3 to 4 guys standing around doing nothing but checking out the women they do not smile , they do not say hello and when we say hello in spanish , they usually do not respond we took my parents and sister and considered actually leaving 2 days early we have traveled to over 17 countries and stayed in 5 star hotel and 2 star hotels this was probably the worst service that we have ever received on the other hand , the place is truly beautiful and lush the grounds are very well kept and the rooms are acceptable it is a shame that the service is not on par with the grounds we wo not return 
great night life we stayed at the melia caribe tropical from december 7th through december 17throyal servicei read a lot about royal service on this website and was ready to upgrade since many people wrote that they had a horrible time without upgrading the only thing i did not know was the price of the upgrade ( $70 a night per person ) which to me was outrageous why should i pay for room service , better beach and better rooms , things that in some other all inclusive resorts were standards i realized that it is the hotel 's way to make more money on picky tourists i heard many families who have stayed at both , the royal service and the standard service , and said that upgrading is not worth the extra money the resort in generalit is huge i know that everyone writes that in their review and i read plenty of them before leaving for my vacation , but i stayed at large resorts before , but this is just way too big now i think i know why many people are not entirely happy with the resort it is so huge that it is just impossible to make everyone happy and truly manage the area it almost feels as if you are on your own the beach is just too far from the main lobby ( not 10 minutes , but more than 20minutes walking ) and the lobby too far from the beach , so you do tons of walking back and forth you have an option of taking the train/trolley to the lobby ( where most of the restaurants are ) but it just takes forever to come and then is extremely slow we would only take it when it rained out ( and it took us 30 minutes on the trolley to get to the lobby ) raindo not be surprised , it rains one minute and then it 's hot again it is the carribean and the weather is truly tropical roomsrooms are fine with basic necessities ( i 've been to much better rooms that were called standards for the price ) but honestly we mostly just slept and bathed in the rooms it is the time to be out and not in ( otherwise just stay home and do not waste your money ) even if it rains ( please take your umbrella as the hotel overcharges for everything and you will just waste your money ) you can relax in many of their lounges which are truly great , or go to the nearby mall to do some shopping or just walk around and kill time foodfood was pretty good the best was the lunch at the beach restaurant on the tropical side lots of choices and a nice view of the beach breakfasts were good too with amazing chocolate croissants please tip , one dollar goes a long way and although the resort claims that tips are included in the price , do you really believe them we took $100 in singles and tipped one dollar after every meal rarely did we see other people tip at all one good tip : they serve drinks in tiny cups , so to save yourselves time , grab the styrofoam cups the hotel provides next to the ice machines scattered around the resort and ask the bartenders to fill them up with beer , soda etc because it is styrofam it stays cool longer and you can just chill without getting up longer as well nightlifethis resort has the best nightlife i 've seen anywhere they have great shows everyday , but the lounges are top notch , you feel like you are in a big metropolitan city in some nice club negatives - too much traffic if you are walking from the beach to the lobby there are only two or three main roads that you can take , on which cars pass by all the time , so you have to be careful and move aside the cars are pretty old and you end up inhaling more fumes that they produce than if you live in the city i truly was getting annoyed at this , and the hotel employees do not care at all that you are walking - cigarette smoke is just plain annoying most people who smoked at the resort were not considerate of others around them they smoked in your face at the pool , on the beach , in restaurants , lounges etc they did not care if there were kids around or not - prices - everyone tries to rip off tourists be careful as the prices vary greatly whatever price the seller offers offer at least half of it or less the product most likely is not even worth that otherwise walk away ( unless you are willing to spend the money ) shares - please just ignore them , they do this because of the incentive the hotel gives them ( for every presentation they receive $30 from the hotel per person and that is really a lot of money for them they are a huge annoyance at this resort and their booths so you have to walk by them no matter what since it the only way to get to the restaurants , bars and eventually your room they even got us on the beach , truly annoying - sales people - those are the owners of small souvenir shops by the beach they will wake you up if you are sleeping in your beach chair to give you their business card and drag you to their store if they succeed , they begin to rip you off by quoting outrageous prices taking a walk on the beach , you will probably encounter at least three or four people stopping you to lure you into their store - waitress service - this is one of the only resorts that does not have waitresses walking around the pool and the beach taking orders for drinks they do not even have a bar by the beach , so you have to walk all the way to the pool area to get a drink it is really cheap saona islandthis is the best excursion we have ever been on the beach on that island is just truly amazing the most beautiful water i 've seen the island is not inhabited by anyone , no hotels are built there , and nature is preserved in its original form the speedboat ride to the island is amazing , a great experience you come back on the catamaran which is also real cool : - ) you are out on the trip for 13 hours we drove through higuey , a city close to punta cana where you are able to see how dominicans live 
not a 5- star property i 've just returned from a 5- night stay at this resort i am in the hotel industry , so i am aware of all the challenges that a resort of this size in this part of the world can have here are some pros and cons i encountered during my stay : pros : public spaces are beautiful landscaping is very well maintained restaurants are clean and have nice ambiance almost every staff member is very friendly and accommodating the beach is stunning and there are always enough chairs to accommodate guests enough activities to keep yourself busy if you want to cons : rooms are in dire need of renovation bathrooms are old and tired as are the beds and furniture there is almost no water pressureand showering can be a challenge - especially on days when there is a shortage of towels as well food is average and lacks real flavor there are too many people in the resort and on the beach trying to sell you a time share , braids for your hair , pictures with lizards andother things that are not included in your all - inclusive package please keep in mind that although the packages are sold as all inclusive , tipping is very much appreciated by the staff overall not the worst vacation , but this is not a resort or location that i would return to on another occaison it is nowhere near a 5- star property closer to a 3 
way too big , would not return i stayed at the melia caribe tropical about a year ago , and completely forgot to review it i 'll try to write as best as i can remember , but overall , we did not have a pleasant stay , inconvenience after inconvenience we had a large group age range from 9 - 90 first and foremost , a few very important tips about this resort : - do not get a room near the jungle as i like to call it - a room on the side near the beach is better as it 's close to the pools , beach , etc if you stay on the further side on the other side of the jungle , it 's like a 20 min walk to the beach and pool , which i find ridiculous in a resort a room on the second floor if possible , to avoid bugs - book your restaurant reservations as early as possible or you wo not get one , and will have to eat at the buffet - any excursions should be booked through your hotel front desk , do not book through the vendors on the beachoverall , the resort has some good and i 'll try to be fair in explaining both the positive and negative we did not have the royal service as stated , it took very long to check in , probably about an hour , and we had two persons with disabilities with us we had requested in advance certain rooms near the pool , first floor , etc for these people in our group they did not have any record of our requesting this and we got whatever was left we were told by our travel agent that this resort was excellent for persons with disabilities , but i would really disagree the main thing that i did not like about this resort was that it 's much too large and spread out by the time i understood where everything was , it was time to leave the two main lobbies look fairly similar and it 's very confusing to know where you are the trolly 's that were provided to get around the resort were always full , we found it faster to walk the 20 minutes to wherever we needed to go this could also be due to march being a busy time our first room was near the jungle as i like to call it on the far side of the resort , away from the pool and beach we arrived at night , so we had no idea and no one explained this to us after 1 night in that room , the next day our room was infested with bugs , they looked like cockroaches or something we were horrified and found that others on our floor had similar problems , one had a frog in her room so they switched us fairly promptly and we got a room on the tropical side this time , and closer to the pool , which was great we also requested to be on the second floor this time to avoid bugs , this helped a lot what i think this hotel really needs is some kind of guard under the door , there is a huge space under every door where any lizard and bug can crawl right into your room one night a lizard was in our room at the head of our bed we called front desk and someone came to take it away apart from this , the rooms were clean and tidy the tropical rooms have more of a carribbean feel to them , which is nice , but the caribe side is more classy and modern , both were nice , but the tropical rooms felt more like you were on vacation the caribe rooms seemed to be newer we had to leave a note to get towel animals lol another thing we had a problem with was our safety deposit box , it would not work we kept telling them and it would not get fixed and they continued to bill us for it we did not even end up using it since it did not work and we had to fight them that we were not paying for that portion of our bill it took a while , but we didnt have to pay for it after the grounds were immaculate , absolutely loved them the flamingos and nature were beautiful just bring bug spray at night , but it was gorgeous to walk at night or during the day only thing is , when the ground gets wet , it 's very slippery the restaurants were great , the japanese is amazing , a must try they cook right in front of you on a large grill that everyone sits around , it was very interesting the buffets were good too , always had a good selection of food and never got sick my only complaint was the 24 hour snack bar , the food was always stale there and not much selection , so if arriving at night , dont expect anything great breakfast was really nice near the beach the italian restaurante was not great at all , would not recommend the nightly entertainment was great , but it started somewhat early and we never made it on time by the time we finished dinner the disco was good , but there was never anyone in there , maybe a handful of people if that , and this was march this resort is definitely for couples or older people who like to go to bed early , there is no nightlife whatsoever the pools were beautiful and kept clean , but always a shortage of towels so get your towels early same goes for your room , we often did not have enough towels supplied to us , and after calling a few times , we would have to wait at least an hour to get towels brought to our room we did one excursion , which was the best part of this trip , the swimming with the dolphin excursion we took a bus to a different part of the beach , which was gorgeous it had parrots and was really nice you then get a short lesson and take a motor boat to the middle of the ocean , where you get to swim with the dolphins (3 of them ) in an enclosed area and touch them for about 30 min it was an amazing experience and highly recommended it only cost us about $90 us each i believe and we were gone for about 4 hours completely worth it , but take note , you cannot wear eye glasses into the dolphin area , despite what they may tell you be sure to buy the cd with the pictures , maybe opt out of the dvd movie , its not the same thing as they led us to believe the beach on the resort was nice , white sandy beach , but lots of seaweed this is not the resorts fault as all of the resorts along the beach had this there are many things for the kids to do , a rock climbing wall , a trampoline , activities planned etc at night we had taken a walk into the royal suites area , and the pool there is so nice , would maybe consider this next time i think that 's everything , i 'm sure there were a few other things that went wrong , they tried really hard to please us , but they were just so busy and this resort is much too large i would only recommend this hotel to romantic couples or older people wanting to get away , possibly families , but its just so large 
disappointed i stayed at this hotel last week , and was disappointed my husband and i upgraded to the resorts royal service to ensure a better stay , however , the concept of the service is good , but the staff seems unable to actually provide the services when we arrived off the bus from the airport not one person greeted us or directed us where to check in after asking 3-4 people where royal service check in was we were taken the back alley way to the vip section , when we later learned it was a short walk to the lounge next , our private check in was very brief , and we were sent to a room that was not ready i was not happy with this , and asked for another room , which we received when we arrived to our 2nd room it was also not ready after being told it was we complained to a manager that we were unsatisfied , and our first impression of is resort was poor we received a simple apology after traveling all day we were hungry , and wanted room service ( which was also a vip service ) we had no room service menu , and made 3 phone calls to get a menu , and still we did not receive it until the next day we also had planned to play two round s of golf , but could only play one b/c the concierge could not get a hold of the golf club also , every evening we were to receive turn down service ( new towels , turn down the bed ) we did not receive this service until we called and asked why we were not receiving it we also were told that the vip restraunt had a la carte breakfast , lunch , and dinner that was a lie the resort is a la carte dinner only the lunch buffets were horrible , by that last day my husband and i were both sick dinners were good and the service was a little better there this resort is pretty big and the landscaping is kept nice the beach and pools are also nice on our way home we ran into a few more couples who experienced the same issues , and some worse all in all the price was nice , but i 've been to other all inclusives and would rather pay a little more to ensure good food , and service 
worst vacation ever this resort is highly over rated 4 star is a joke , it 's not even a 1 star roaches roam your rooms communication is poor unless you speak spanish bathrooms in your room not cleaned or supplied properly had to steal a roll of toilet paper from the pool side bathroom we called for toilet paper and got room service with food and a newspaper walkways are very slippery when wet or raining several people fell at the restuarants where water splashes out of fountains on the floors resort is way too large and spread out someone had a pair of slacks stolen from his room beaches are covered with sea weed i also believe that if you were to become ill there you would really suffer and if it was a heart attack or stroke you might even die they do not understand english 
do not deserve 5 stars my wife and i stays at this hotel from nov 1st to nov 8th 2007 we were not royal service guest , so no service at all we did a lot of trips in caribbean and normally go to 3 stars hotels and for the first time we decided to go for a 5 stars and we have been very disappointed of your hotel there here is pros and cons of our stay : - - - - - - - - - - - - - - cons - - - - - - - - - - - - - no royal service = no service at all we did not took the royal service ( servicio real ) because we was thinking it was a 5 stars hotel anyway seriously , if you do not take royal service , this hotel become a 3 stars hotel 1- royal service have nice golf cart shuttle to go everywhere each two minutes normal guest have to wait 15 minutes minimum for the train shuttle and then it takes a slow 15 minutes ride to go to the beach 2- royal service have a bar on the beach normal guest must walk 8 minutes to walk to the nearest pool bar 3- royal service are served faster , better than anyone else at the bars , restaurants , guest service , etc if you are not royal service you have to wait everywhere and poor service without smiles at this hotel , guest that do not take royal service are not appreciated i just believed it was a 5 stars melia hotel for everybody , not just for royal service 6 times each days staff were trying to enrol us in any kind of sol melia reward programs at the restaurant , in the lobby , on the beach , at the pool it was the most annoying thing of our whole trip staff at the hotel were more annoying than local flea market sellers on the beach each day at the turey buffet restaurant the hostess was asking us our room number without telling us why when we asked why she wanted our room number , she told us that the reason was to send somebody to come visit us in our room to talk about reward programs is a lot of promotion everywhere about the seafood in the restaurant of this hotel we got shrimps only one day and that 's it - there was a casino in the hotel , the casino palma real about 20% of the slot machines did not worked and it was not indicated , so i have lost money in broken machines - currency exchange office was closed all time of our stay - on - site accommodations prices are ridiculous : a small solar cream bottle for 20 usd - on the beach there is no toilets , no bars ( except for royal service guest ) , nothing yes there is activities but when you try to do something ( example : volleyball ) you can only have the ball at a specific time if you want to play volleyball in the morning the beach staff said no sorry , the volleyball it 's only on the afternoon it 's ridiculous - - - - - - - - - - - - - - pros - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - great for families there a lot of things to do for kids ( private pool , activities all day long , night show for kids , good babysitting program ) and there is refrigerator in all rooms lot of excursions and activities available air conditioning in restaurant and rooms - food is awesome a lot of different type of food excellent food quality - all is beautiful and clean : rooms , restaurants , outdoor facilities , etc - there is a nice shopping center near the hotel (5 min walk ) with a hard rock caf? restaurant entertainment are great a lot of security guards everywhere - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - finally it is a great hotel if you take royal service only 
very disappointing - just too big we stayed at mct during tropical storm noel - it rained solidly which is not a good start this resort is huge none of the beach/pool bars near the rooms stay open after 7pm so to get food and drink you must travel up to the reception area which tis 13 minutes walking or you can get the train if it is not full bothare pretty miserable when it is pouring with rain forget getting dressed up if you are going to be soaked when you arrive to play golf you have to leave your room an hour before your tee time as it takes 15 minutes to get to reception ( possibly longer if the train is not nearby ) and then there is a resort bus which only runs once an hour to the golf course the first time we waited an hour but it still did not come and then the next day when we tried again , on arrival at the golf club we were told we needed to have brought vouchers from the hotel - do not pass go do not collect 200 nowhere was this explained to us even when we were booking tee times and 2 of the 3 groups on the bus had likewise made the same mistake , the other having made it the previous day the activities were pretty much nonexistent even before the rain as it was low season and they did not even publish a sheet of daily activites and the club room was mostly closed the golf course also closed due to flooding so there was not a lot going on , we were glad to get out and go to sunscape the beach which was more our scene 
good quick getaway my husband and i stayed in early november for a four day anniversary trip here?? an overview of our experience : roomwe stayed in a royal service deluxe junior suite the floor and the bathroom were marble ( except for the tub ) the mattress was hard , but we slept fine the linens were okay , but there were some holes in the pillow and sheets that we noticed on our last night each morning , the rooms were made up , but the night turndown service was inconsistent one night we came home to a bottle of rum , candles and flowers on the bed and in the bathroom the other nights , nothing the room was clean , and housekeeping kept the bathroom stocked ( but took away all of the conditioner and put extra lotion in it?? place ) our refrigerator had complimentary beer , soda and water that was inconsistently refilled one issue with the room was that our travel agent had requested a king bed ? she had written ??elebrating anniversary? king bed , please? in all caps on our paperwork we were shown to our room , and found two double beds we asked to be moved , were told it would take an hour , and it actually took three we had left our luggage in the first room , so we couldn?? change out of our traveling clothes we gave ourselves a tour of the resort in the meantime foodthere were a number of restaurants in the hotel , and with only three nights , we obviously didn?? get to all of them we tried to get some of the staff to tell us which to try , but they gave us a non - committal ??hey??e all good? we ate at the gabi restaurant , exclusively for royal service guests , each day for breakfast and lunch and the first night for dinnerbecause we couldn?? get a reservation due to our late arrival the food at dinner was ala carte and buffet , and my husband was happy to eat two appetizers and a dinner the food was decent ? not great , but not terrible the buffet breakfast and lunch were good we really enjoyed the dominican offerings ? the rice and beans were a different style each day , and the plantain dishes were tasty reservations could only be made a day in advance because we enjoyed the dominican food , we booked reservations at el guarapo the food was ??pscale? dominican , and it was not that impressive we were in and out of the restaurant in about 45 minutes , including appetizer , main course and dessert the food seemed pre - cooked , and came out very quickly there was a wedding in another part of the restaurant , so i don?? know if that contributed to the pace of the meal we weren?? done our first course before the next one came out our final night , we ate at capri , the seafood restaurant the food was better here , the kitchen was open , and they definitely prepared the food to order at the beach bars and pool bar in the royal service section , there were snacks offered throughout the day service/staffthe staff , for the most part , were accommodating and willing to help we had issues with our second room ? no robes , the tv remote didn?? work , our toilet ran ? that took over a day for them to attend to however , they were minor issues that were fixed the golf cart drivers always stopped to see if we wanted a ride ? we were located near the royal service lobby , and the walk to the beach was about 7 minutes , so we usually declined royal serviceit was a nice upgrade , as the beach and pool were never too crowded however , while not crowded with people , there were a lot of beach chairs crammed into the royal service beach area we??e early risers , and were at the beach before 9, so we never had a problem sitting where we wanted part of the royal service was supposed to include butler service ( we never saw a butler ) and a pillow menu ( didn?? see that , either ) the rs lobby did have a nice selection of alcohol after dinner where you could make your own drinks , as well as an espresso machine that was available all day overallthis vacation served it?? purpose ? it was inexpensive , all - inclusive and got us a few days of sun i?? used to smaller resorts , so one with over 1000 rooms overwhelmed me a bit the grounds were well kept and there were turtles , herons ( or egrets ) and lots of anoles we had tiny little bugs in our bathroom , but nothing more scary than that i speak basic spanish ( two years in high school a decade ago ) , and was fine with communicating most of the staff speaks english well , and there were other staff members who were communicating with the french and german speaking guests there was a large non - american guest population and a lot of topless sunbathing there was some seaweed in the water ? i don?? know if it was due to the tropical depression that went through the week prior or if it?? normally like that i wasn?? wowed by the resort , and do not know if i 'd go back , but it was a good quick getaway 
it was overwhelming our stay was oct 19 - 26thnegatives upon arrival at the hotel the guest ahead of us was having some sort of conflict with the desk clerk and his manager was very angry it was then our turn and he said your room is 3904 right here pointing to a map and we said ok he said not a good room for $100 more i can get you a better room my boss is mad at me and this will make him happy my husband wanting to have a more central location to the beach and pool , agreeded he was presented a plain white envelop to place the $100 00 in cash in the envelop this gave me a bad feeling in a foreign country , not knowing the layout of the hotel grounds ( new to us ) and then , this so we were then to proceed to the vacation club reps who set up a time tomorrow onto our room , dropped us off on the wrong end of the building but we found our way the room 3005 was average the maid service did not appear the next full day and had to be reported , the following day she came at 6pm while we were showering faces cloths are obtained by face to face communication only the bars were a long distance from the beach and you could not go to the one within the buffett unless you had a shirt and shoes no receptacles for smokers vacation club staff stalked you as much as possible the shows were poor at best attended one and that was enough the mesquitos were terrible and i had many welts on my legs and ankles no communtication with when vendors were coming postives the food was outstanding and no problem with reservations pools and beach were clean and bar service was very good at the ones we went to the casino  sports bar is small but fun we were amused for several hours the towel service was fine and no beach vendors the place is huge and takes a few days to understand the layout even then we did not get to the tropical side at all i will not be returning 
relaxing and sunny , but will not go back , rude staff airport : expect to walk out of the plane and onto the runway strip once you walk into the airport there are people that will stop you to take a picture you can purchase these pictures at the end of your stay in dr upon departure you have to pay $10 for entering dr the line is very long for customs we had a rude pickup transportation driver this was the beginning of our bad trip upon arriving melia , at check in there is a little posting with prices of upgrade for royal service and regular room rates my friend and i decided to upgrade and skip all excursions upgrading is well worth the money for an extra $30/night we were told that they 'll be a butler driving us to our restaurant every night and to the beach the only service we got was housekeeping and benjamin driving us back and forth whenever we saw him at the beach housekeeping and benjamin was the best service we received at melia besides the waiter at the french restaurant because we tipped the guy restaurant : hokkaido was good , it is a japanese hibachi grill restaurant but on my first night at melia the clock in our room was slow by an hr , without realizing this , the host at hokkaido was not willing to accommodate my friend and i because she said we were late for our reservations and she was very rude i mentioned this to the vip royal service desk and they were not nice about it she just brushed us off we were forced to go to gabi restaurant at the royal service and was bitten up with lots of mosquito bites the american grill was good and so was the french restaurant we didnt get a chance to try any other restaurants on the property the lunch at the royal service side was by far much better than the tropical buffet pool : there 's always available lounge chairs at the royal service pool area and never crowded in the pool we did get a chance to walk over to the other pool it 's much larger with more people around the pool bring lots of sunscreen beach : the beach was pretty clean with the exceptions of occasional seaweed i did see the people cleaning this up one afternoon there 's always security walking around the beach area and like the royal service pool area , the royal service beach wasnt so crowded the water is clear and strong waves even though we upgraded to royal service , we had a regular room that was only around the corner from the royal service pool and gabi restaurant the service sucks here the hotel servers/waiters will either be really nice to you or ignore you completely i think some of them are racist there was one couple sitting next to us one morning and the waiter refilled their cup of coffee and walked away ignoring our request for refill the waiters at night is much more nice than the daytime staff the vip lounge has free internet , books to read , coffee/tea/drinks and snacks through the morning and night spa : i couldnt find the spa at melia the property is so huge that i spent an hour walking around looking for it there are two spa at this resort i booked a aromatherapy massage it was ok but she spent most of the time lightly rubbing my back i can tell you this for sure , ny spas are much more experienced overall the resort was relaxing , weather was nice and food was good we didnt get sick but do be careful , we did hear several guest getting sick during their stay i would not recommend this resort to any friends unless you want a quick getaway from the city life and hang out at a resort the staff and dominicans are rude no offense to some of you out there i would return to this hotel if there 's a deal this is my first and last time i would go to dr i understand why some of my friends refuses to visit dr after one trip beware of flies and mosquitoes there are lots of them all around 
this hotel is a piece of crap the food is awful , the rooms worn out , the beach and pools are sooooo far away from most of the bungalows that you end up just not going , the ambience terrible , and the staff not very helpful , to say something go somewhere else , trust me , this property sucks 
disappointed in basic standard of resort , royal service a must arrived as a family of 6 people , including my mum , we were firstly met by a long wait a reception in the heat of the day we had 3 rooms virtually together which was good , the room decor and quality was just about adequate , not what you would expect from a 5* resort the ala 'carte resteraunts were great especially the capri , ( sea food ) la gondola ( italian ) , la pagoda ( thai ) whatch out for some of the bar staff at the main bar , they are always looking for the big tippers and can leave you waiting a while to be served the grounds were kept immaculate , and the little train runs regularly , the bell boys will always stop and give you a ride on their carts some staff are not very fluent in english and we tried to speak spanish at our basic level , so communication can be difficult we decided to upgrade to royal service the last two days of our vacation and only wish we had done this from day one , the experience was totally different , this side was 5* and what we had expected from the normal standard room , we would return but only in royal service , the money they charge can be negociated on arrival 
the good , the bad the ugly and everything else in between - the drive to the hotel is not very pretty punta cana is one big contruction site , it will be nice in like 10 years but right now is just not so nice there is garbage everywhere its a thrird world country but poverty is no excuse to throw garbage on the side of the roads on the green areas - the hotels is basically a gated complex once you enter it is very pretty once we arrived at the lobby we were prompted by the staff to leave our luggage by the side with the porters while we check in once you get yor room assigned then you tell the porter and then they deliver your luggage - one of our luggages was stolen/lost while being looked after it by the hotel staff we called the managers and the told us that it was probably delivered to a different guest room and that they will have the staff look at every room etc they managment said that they would carry an investigation , but nothing turned up - the luggage was either stolen or lost under the cared of the hotel staff and we/ everyone is told to leave their luggage there so you would think the hotel is responsive for this not according to them , instead we were meet with hostility and ai do not care its not our problem our our responsablity responsethe exact words of the management was  there is nothing we can do , its not our responsablityhow can that be the luggage was stolen or lost while under their care we were not offer any kind of conpensation and we had 3 kids left without clothing for a whole week we asked the manager if they would at least provide some bathing suits for the kids they said yes that they will personally deliver a set for each at the room 2 days after still no bathing suits , they reason was because they were being clean since they were used bathing suits left by previous guest we were outraged and we told them we would not accept them at the end to the day we were left without our luggage with all brand new thingsand a management that would not do nothing about it there for a our wedding/blessing/honeymoon and we had spoken with the wedding department in advance , we were expecting an upgrade one that did not happen were greated as vips and given champagne at the guest services desk we were told that we where being given an upgrade and in broken english told very very nice room they room as far from nice it was like a motel room and there was rust in all the fixtures , no air conditioner , no hot waterfar from a honeymoon suite like we were promised contacted our wedding coordinator the next day , told her about the room and how we ddint get the upgrade and that our room was so discusting miss sol the coodinator told us that if we were not given the upgrade upon arrival that that was it she could not move us we were less than impress with this lack of costumer service and how the management just did not want to help the following day we meet with our thomson rep jon he was great we told him about the problem with our room and guess what he said no worries i will talk to them and you will be changed to another room we were given what we initially were promised a room with a jacuzzy and with hot water nand air con what the hotel staff could not do our holiday rep from thomson did the same problem of dirty , smelly , dated room was encountered by some our wedding party guest however they book thru expedia/ internet and they are not reps for them at the hotel so did not have anyone to defend them so for that i would recomment to go with a travel agency rather than booking thru the internet - the hotel is big and its very divided the caribe side in my opinon was nicer both the caribe and tropical have a restaurant oin from of the beach and next to their pool caribe is turey , for tropical is agora they are open restaurants by the beach they were both very dirty and there were flies everywhere all over the food al over the plates how can they even allow this to happen its a heath hazzard , many of the cooks would be wiping their sweet while cooking the food and not wash their hands right infront of us while cooking the food the flies where everywhere , they were this domes cover on the food but they have opening on the front for serving , thats how they flies would get in no food tray was left without havng flies all over it i wanted to throw up we were in building 36, right in front of the beach facing palma real hotel and the royal service beach , nice location , nice room in comparison to the first one we got but still dated and in need of tlc the beach was right next to us and also they turey grill but it was so discusting we had to take the trolly everyday to the main lobby to have some food with out it being laced with flies breakfast buffet is at the market place restaurant ( formely known as atabales ) its a buffet and its been newly renovated so its very very pretty , lunch buffet is at the gondola ( its the italian rest ) but its a bit dated but we were told that is was being renovated in september the restaurants : all food : mediocre , decor : very pretty , service : they try really hard and work really hard but they were messing the orders half of the time , i just think they are not properly trainned not fault on the workers but fault on the management ( nothing was authentic ( except for the dominican one ) each have a very very limited menus , i could have gotten more variety at the buffet in fact the food is just like in the buffet just nicely plated and in smaller portions hokkaido : ( japanese ) not authentic , rather greasy , not much of a show the cheft brought everything already cutted up so it was not like a performace in the chopping and the cooking like its done in japanese restaurantshacienda : ( mexican ) not authentic the menu basically burritos and enchiladas nicely plated that is not real mexican food that is fastfood why burritos at an a la carte restaurant i have tons of mexican friends and they mexican cuisine is extensice and its certainly not just burritos and tacos american grill : basically dennis/ applebys menu burgers and fries ma maison : ( french ) not french at all just basically nicely plated buffet foodpagoda : ( asian ) nothing special had the most choices in the menu but it was basically not an a la carte the menu was basically the tipical asian dishes : sweet and sour pork , egg rolls , fried dumplins etc nicely plated but were the same as in the buffet it was all assembled food to food that was created like its done in an a la cartecapri : ( seafood ) : same food like in the buffet just nicely plated i was disappointed how the litte things were not done example the mash potatoes 
beautiful place , but customer service sorely lacking my family and i stayed at the melia last week we were a big group , 27 total , with children the resort was absolutely beautiful , very large complex the beach was breathtaking , clean , white sand the grounds were well kept i think the staff could have been more courteous their attitude was oh well they did not go out of their way to please people i heard other guests complain as well about the service check - in was a long process i was suppose to have a room upgrade and it was not in their system nothing was done to accomodate me another issue was making dinner reservations it was very , very difficult to make reservations for our group many times we had to eat late or break up the group most annoying was going to dinner without half of our group and the restaurant could have clearly seated us all i usually had to call several times a day to make reservations because all the restaurants were always booked , according to the reservations desks , but at the same time they would not allow you to make reservations days in advance i think they could have been more accomodating to us as a group and as guests period the attitude among the staff was unacceptable 
we stayed for a week in melia caribe tropical we choose it because we have confidence in meli? hotels the hotel is great , with gardens , pools , activities , etc waht you expect to find in a great resort the hotel has two problems : teh humidity and the staff rooms are not well conditioned for the exagerated humidity in punta cana i didi not find the way to dry my swimsuit the one i weared the first day arrived wet when we get back to barcelona but the main problem is the staff they 're not there to serve you , not to make you feel comofortable it seems a party for the staff too we had read the checking was really slow we jump out the bus to be the firsts we did the check in and they told us they 'll bring us our suitcases to room we went to the room and wait we wait two hours and half they were playing in the swimmimgpool ( not with guest , , , ) , eating in the buffet ( if you wanted and ice crime , you have to wait 5 minutes until 5 or 6 staff members where there taking icecream for theirselves seemed they were there to catch a girlfriend , not to work but i do not know if is it in this hotel or in the whole republica dominicana 
it was not terrible , but it was not good either just got back from a 7 night stay at melia caribe tropical ( punta cana ) with my family half of the service staff was very friendly and helpful , the other half was outright annoyed that we bothered them the place is just a bit confusing to get around - and their map did not really help to begin with , we were given a room with wrong number of beds , and then we had to explain 5 times why we needed a different room i do not know why everyone was raving about the food - maybe my family and i are too picky , but it was not good the only a la cart restaurant that was half - way decent was the american grill everyone was trying to make reservation to the japanese restaurant - it was really bad , with a wait of over an hour after the reservation time , stale sushi , brown lettuce in the salad and overcooked , over salted rice , meat and seafood there 's construction going on in certain places ( like one of the buffet halls ) which is by their own brochure is supposed to be open until 10:30 - but nobody mentioned this on our way out , just in case we called hour and a half before leaving to get our luggage , in the end both we and our apple transfer rep had to ask 3 more times to get it to the lobby - in the end we left about 20 minutes after our departure time 
better than i thought i booked my trip , then read many reviews and got a bit worried , but it was better than i thought many things were true , check - in very slow , the lobby was pretty , but very warm , dinner reservations were annoying to get we ate at every resturant we wanted to , including japanese , but someone needed to be on the phone at 9:00, it took us anywhere between 5-40 minutes for someone to answer the phone we waited by the lobby phone at 8:45 and i got an answer i handed to the phone to the next person in line it was annoying to spend so much time on the phone , but we met many nice people in the same situation our room was ok , we did get clean towels and water and soda i left the maid $1 and a little gift ( perfume , lipstick ) every day the room did smell musty , i brought an air fresher from home the ac was very weak , and i felt the floor was dirty i was happy not to find any bugs the beach was beautiful , a few twigs , but not a bother the dominican people were nice , we did tip alot , because we wanted to tip did not really have a language problem , took along a spanish dictionary , but never used it the grounds were pretty and well kept the food was better than i imaged we ate breakfast indoors , which we liked , not as warm , no bugs , less crowded , you get seated all resturants were good , american grill , french , international i did not care for the capri , thought it smelled fishy and food tasted fishy japanese was nice , you eat with 12 at a table , and it was nice to talk to other people fried ice cream was great entertainment was bad , it was outdoors and hot it reminded of a child 's dance recital on a whole we had a great time , it does take a day or two to get used to the place , taking the train and finding where everything is located we avoided the time share people , but we spoke to people who took the tour and yes , it was a lot longer than promised and they were pushy , but you did get a gift finally , we were 6 people and no one got sick 
we have been in better places in punta cana we just returned from our summer vacation at the melia caribe tropical ( july 19-23 / group of 6) and i can say that all the bad reviews in this section are true the restaurant reservation system is a mess you have to be creative with the hotel personnel to get what you want the food at the night reservation restaurants is average , been the worst the pagoda ( chinese / thai the drink mixes are very poor i think that the huge size of the hotel dilutes the general quality of service you get less of what you have paid what is good the nightly show and the mamajuana the dancers are extraordinary talented and the mamajuana ( a national drink ) puts you in orbit i have been before in the bavaro princess and in the iberostar where i received better personal service and have enjoyed more my vacation i do not recommend this hotel 
did not meet our expectations we were very disappointed in our stay at that the melia caribe tropicale let me start by saying that we were a big group of 13 which can always pose some problems with arrangements the beach was very nice but vacationers need to be mindful of picking up their stuff since quite often we found plastic cups in the water that goes for the pool too , as we would find garbage lying around our biggest challenges were with the dinner reservations their system needs a major overhauling to make reservations for the following nights meal you needed to call starting at 9:00 pm the night before each night one of our group needed to remove themselves from dinner to go to the phone in the restaurant and call guest services for reservations this was not a 5 minute deal this was a 20-30 minute ordeal since the entire resort with the exception of royal service guests is doing the same thing we were only able to get reservations to where we wanted on 2 nights the other nights we had to take what was available this is a joke since each night when we walked into the restaurants there were at least 7-8 tables empty we were informed that the resort holds blocks off a certain number of tables for royal service and that you can call back at 1:00 the day of to see if they were taken , if not they are then up for grabs we tried that on a few occassions , but were still turned away they also told us that if we showed up at a restaurant without reservations that we would be turned away ( with kids we opted not to try this option ) the food was mediocre at best we enjoyed the japanese restaurant and the mexican , however the italian and the american were not good we had heard that the french was good too , but again could not get reservations the buffets were fair at best the selection of alcohol was minimal and difficult to get a proper drink my margarita did not tast like anything close to a margarita you could not get premium brand liquor and if you wanted it their were very few bars that had them and of course we were told that we would have to pay i did not see on their website that you would have to pay extra for imported alcohol , same was with the wine you could get their house wine , but if you wanted a particular bottle off the wine list it was extra the rooms were decent when we arrived we were told that we were going to be put in the family suites had i known i would have asked to go into a standard room as the dinasour bones pillows , curtain pulls and , decorations do not exactly do it for me i get that they were keeping up with the flintstones theme but my children who are 7  9 do not know the flintstones ( was not their era ) our tub was clogged , but they fixed it by the next day the ac was not strong and i am someone that my husband says is cold in august so for me to be warm must say something about the system may just need an update another concern for us was that 3 of the people in our group got swimmers ear it was mentioned to us that there could be higher level of bacteria in the pool i do not know enough about swimmers ear to comment on it , but i must admit i never did smell any chlorine the activities for the kids cost money they had a zip line , rock climbing wall and trampolines again i could not find any mention of extra fees on their website , but when we got their they were charges to use it overall the place looks tired and could use a bit of a sprucing up as a group we had fun and laughs , but agreed that this was not a place we would go back to several of us also got a stomach bug but i 'm a believer that this can happen anywhere so i do not attribute that to the place if that were the case i would end up never leaving the states 
just returned from melia caribe tropical this was my 3rd all inclusive vacation this hotel has pros and cons , just like other places however , for us , the cons outweighed the pros and for that reason , we would never go back to this hotel check - in : absolutely horrific there was a long line up , and our turn came over an hour later after another 30 minutes of watching the guy play on the computer and ignore our questions , we were abruptly told that we would be transferred to a another hotel due to overbooking problems the next day , we were sent back to the melia therefore , the first 2 days of our vacation was all about waiting , being told lies and getting frustrated the people working there are extremely rude and big liars , be prepared resort : huge and absolutely beautiful the landscaping is truly amazing however , the size of this resort became a huge problem there is a very very long road separating the lobby from the bungalow/beach area there was no way we could walk that road , it was too long there is a train that passes by every 15 minutes , but you could wait up to an hour at night ( after the show ) due to the slow service and the limited quantity of seats so we felt completely dependent on the train and we lost a lot of time because of it the guys driving the train do not speak english , you have to communicate with them with hand and feet gestures and cross your fingers that they take you to the right place service : incredibly bad this was the worst part of our vacation first of all , if you do not speak spanish , you will feel like a moron only about 1% of employees speak decent english , the waiters in restaurants do not even understand the order unless you point out the selected meal on the menu about 90% of the visitors staying at this resort were latinos therefore , the workers do not make any effort in learning english their communication skills are unacceptable considering the industry they work in room : not pretty yes , you can smell humidity , but that is normal in tropical resorts , it 's inevitable the thing we did not appreciate is the maid service there was always something missing ( towel , sheet ) save your money , giving out tips wo not help the bathroom was not very clean either beach : nice , but i have seen better beaches the beach in cuba is 100 times cleaner and nicer here , the water is light green and full of seaweed some good things about the beach : there is no waves , the water is warm , and the sand is very fine and white pool : very beautiful , but extremely crowded some people were in the pool with their clothes and i saw several babies in diapers not very hygienic the breakfast buffet is excellent , there is a wide variety of food note that the service is very slow , and so the coffee would always arrive very late ( on many occasions , after we were finished eating ) for lunch , we tried the 2 buffets again , there is a wide variety of food , some good and some bad the a la carte restaurants were ok we really really loved the chinese restaurant we did not like the french food the reservations must be done over the phone the day before ( between 9pm and 11pm ) or on the same day after 9am you have to call asap , otherwise you wo not find a place i know this caused a problem for some people animation : very nice group of people the evening shows were nice , but i would have liked to see more comedy ( fun stuff ) 
some good , some not so good we went there for our 25th wedding anniversary and we had mostly a great time , but , there 's always a but but i will not go back there for a vacation again first the resort is way to big , we 've stayed at smaller resorts and they are much more appealing the food was actually quite good but getting a reservation at an ala carte is very difficult you have to start calling at 9pm and really ca not get through for at least 1/2 hour unless your lucky and by then all the good times are taken we had much better luck and a lot less time dialing at 2:30 the day of the reservation and got mostly what we wanted men must wear shoes that are actually shoes and not sandals even if they are closed toe and heel the beach quite nice and breezy which really is needed because it is way too hot there in june do request to have a room by the pool and beach because you ca not walk to the pool and beach during the day much to hot and humid and the train is slow and spews out all this toxic exhaust much nicer to walk to dinner and back at night when it is a little cooler check in was really as painful as it get 's , i do not think ever met people as unaccommodating as them first day they checked us into a room by the lobby with 2 single beds and said they could not switch us even though they switched us from our original rooms that were scratched out by pen right in front of us i think i spent 2 hours the first day trying to get a decent room and then 2 hours the second day getting a decent room and then 2 hours after that waiting for the bell boys to switch our luggage then they checked us into a room that had a welcome honeymoon package for another couple and then we received their welcome bottle of rum and fruit tray needless to say we were then afraid that the honeymoon couple were going to also be checked into our new room which actually was quite nice the week then went quite well until the traveller 's diarrhea hit , and you can get quite dehydrated quickly in that extreme heat i will not return to this resort , we previously stayed at the riu properties in the dominican which i would return to and the beach is much nicer there i think i will stick to canada in the summer and will go south in the winter only 
go elswhere unless you love loud music and the nyc subway system the biggest problem with this resort is its size the grounds are gorgeous but getting around is a big hassle requiring waiting in the hot sun for trams in fact sometimes it is necessary to transfer from one tram to another to get to where you want reminding me of using the nyc subway system the place is generally chaotic and confusing making reservations for a restaurant is a nightmare the foods is ok check in and check out was an abomination causing us to almost miss our transportation back to the airport if booking a package by - pass the prepaid transfers they require waiting in long lines and then spending time sitting on a bus going from hotel to hotel it 's faster to take a taxi for $25 i stayed in the royal service area which is well worth the extra money the rooms are beautiful rooms in the rest of the hotel are dumps service is poor although the staff is friendly enough housekeeping can be sporadic only received turn down service twice during my eight day stay one person in my party received no housekeeping service one day another in my party had flooding in her room from the rain , and another a stuffed drain that required two trips to fix and was only finally fixed after it flooded the room below finally if you love loud obnoxious music this is the place for you forget taking a nap the music pounds everywhere 18 hours a day 
do not stay here my husband , 20 yr old son and 17 yr old daughter returned from our 7 night stay at this resort on july 3rd the grounds are beautiful peacocks and beautiful flowers adorn the property but , here is my review in a nutshell :1 it is very hot wear comfortable shoes - you will walk a lot to and from the beach/pool/restaurants men need to bring shoes - no sandals of any kind are permitted in the restaurants so if you want to eat at any , the men will need sneakers , or any type of shoes women may wear whatever they want we could not eat dinner at any of the a la carte restaurants because we 're from florida and my husband brought only flip flops and leather dress sandals he was not permitted in the restaurants for dinner do not stop to talk to the people wearing shirts with the logo sol melia on them , unless you are interested in spending up to 3 hours listening to a sales pitch for a time share the employees that work in the lobby area , can be rude the gentleman at guest services was so rude to us that we were considering coming home early he told us , after we voiced some concerns regarding our room 's cleanliness and some insect issues , that if we wanted to go home , we could pack right then and do so we would have to sue the hotel once we got back to the us to use the water sports equipment you will need to reserve it make reservations early definitely go out to the country - it is beautiful and the natives are very friendly much friendlier than the resort personnel we took the bavaro runners tour and it was the best day we had in dr well worth your money did i mention the employees at the main lobby can be rude when you order drinks , make sure you tell them you want alcohol , otherwise you wo not get any in your drink the only tips worth giving are the housekeeper and the bartenders if you are going to frequent the same bar if you enjoy the sun but need a little break some times , get to the beach early and get a hut they are awesome i would not recommend this resort to anyone because of the rudeness of the employees especially guest services 
never go - i 'm serious this is not some complaint about weak drinks or moldy hotel rooms it has taken me over a year to have the stomach to write this review long story short , within 48 hours of arriving at the hotel , my husband asked me to call a doctor fortunately i speak spanish , because most of the staff speaks minimal english - which is fine , until your husband thinks he 's dying he 's in so much pain he was hospitalized for 2 days and on an iv the doctor explained to me thathis e coli was a common problem for tourists , as many of the wait staff does not wash their hands after using the restroom - seriously when we got back to the hotel and were deciding how to get home , i got sick i was too sick to even be taken out by ambulance or helicoper the hotel literally had to place a nurse in my room 24 hrsa day to change my iv until 4 days later when i was well enough to fly home our hospital and medical bills totalled around $3000 trip insurance did not cover the trip because we had use of our room ( since i could not leave ) the entire time when i called the hotel to speak to my doctor the week after , the staff explained that the entire medical staff had been terminated over the weekend and that i could not access my medical records , which i needed to process my insurance claim i know this sounds unbelievable do not go , and do not expectthe hotel chain to care if you become ill due to their food preparation 
what to expect let me first say , i have traveled all over ( carribean , africa , asia , and the us ) i was convinced to travel to the dr by someone who had travled often there she only had wonderful things to say about it , so i figured what the heck , lets go my boyfriend and i landed on june 9 2007 in the dr the airport was a little chaotic but we did not mind , it was time to relax we got our luggage and found a taxi to take us to our hotel from the airport to the hotel there is a paved road surround by the jungle most other roads , were sand you could see that they are trying to build up the country but they have a long way to go we say empty billboard signs along the road and also what seemed to be vacation houses for tourists ( i ca not see how the locals would afford these ) when we finally arrived to the melia , we were very lucky because we were what seemed to be the 1st to arrive from our flight but it did not matter because we waited about 30 minutes while a couple was checking out the first desk is extremely slow i 'm very serious about this with the sweltering heat , it was extremelty annoying to wait but we were paitent and i would say check in was about an hour we were then led from the front desk to our room the room was ok , not what i expected it was a ltitle dingy not what the pictures showed i felt like all the furniture was purchased from another hotel going out of business the resort itself was very nice , we had peacocks roaming around ( but sometimes they would scream when you were trying to sleep ) i did not hang out at the pool but i did travel to the beach it was nice , white sandy beaches , and the water was blue they did have non motorized water sports that i did take advantage of bt make sure you get their early because you have to sign up to use them for a half hour their are two resturants on the beach which was nice cause you could get up , walk down to the beach , have breakfast and then go lay out i generally ate lunch there as well there was no bar/ waitress service at the beach which kinda sucked i walked everywhere on the resort i did not bother to wait for the train 1) because it took to long  2) nothing was that far away the food was ok at the resturants i thought the french was the best i did take advantage of playing tennis i brought my own raquet  balls but they will lend you some at night we walked to the mall right outside of our hotel it had about 10 store we also played in the casino , watched the show one night and walked to the beach were they had music and dancing yes almost everyone there speaks spanish including the tourists that did not bother me , the service was pretty good although everyday when we returned from the beach , there were no towels in our room as if they were washing and giving us back the same ones overall , i would say this hotel is about 10 years behing cancun , mexico and if your looking for and nice all inclusive , travel there or puerto rico 
royal service is a royal joke if you have victor and francesco as butlers we spent june 14th -21st at the melia it is a beautiful resort , with wonderful views the royal service was a great dissappointment for us if you get victor or francesco as butlers , you will not see them after you are taken to your room the y did not come thru with any of our requests and went as far as avoiding us and other of the guests they were assigned too in fact the day out of check out they drove right past us make sure at check in you do your reservations , requests jacuzzi services and follow up with calls we seemed to have been forgotten and did not get the specialized service we wanted i will say the gabi is a great place to eat - - wandi - he is the best a caters to your needs wendy the bartender at the lobby was wonderful they have great snacks benjamin , one of the drivers is the best and i will also say nicolas was wonderful i would consider talking to the resort and requesting to not have these butlers - - maybe than your service will be great i knew there was a problem when i spoke to 4 different couples that had the same complaint as for the rides - - do hesitate to keep calling until someone comes as for the obstacle course and ziplines they were at an additional charge each and every time you used them after we were told differently 
never again we just returned from a 9 day stay at the sol melia caribe tropical with our 4 children and a nanny we rented 2 'suites ' in the family section because you ca not be near the beach or the 'family section if you book royal service which they did not tell us until we got there we spent over an hour and a half rearranging our rooms and giving up the royal service so we could be next to our kids and the beach the rooms are very run down , dirty and old the maids could not seem to find king size sheets for our bed and pillows and would put standard or queen on instead so our pillow cases were to short for the pillows and the sheets covered only half of the bed we would be partly on the exposed mattress there was constant leaking from the bathrooms on the 2nd floor into our bathroom which was gross i had to call everyday at least 2 times to get towels for all of us to use to shower and clean up , and there are ants and other creatures in the rooms as well do not go expecting to have a lot to do on the beach as the website leads you to believe very few water sports are inclusive and the ones that are , the paddle boats (3 of them ) , the wind surfers (3 of them ) and the sail boats (2 of them ) are very , very old and run down this is a very large resort so you have to make a reservation and you may not get to use any of this equipment till the next day you have to pay for the banana boats there is a slide you have to pay for too needless to say , our 12 and 14 years olds were bored by the 2nd day we had previously gone to a beaches resort in jamaica and this resort paled in comparison there is only one location to get towels for the beach and the pools and it is far to walk to and they only give you one per person so you ca not just get then for your whole family a few times i went to trade in used towels for new and they did not even have any this resort is huge the lobby , the restaurants and all the evening entertainment is a 15 min walk from the rooms or you can take a train which is still 15 min after you have waited at the stop to get a ride all the staff there , from the people at check in to the bartenders are very unfriendly it was like we were putting them out by asking for something the dress code for dinner in the restaurants is very misleading my husband wore slacks , a collared shirt and closed toe sandals and we were all turned away because of his 'shoes ' i looked in and there was a man in the same restaurant wearing jeans and tennis shoes and a ball cap eating dinner with his family the one good thing we can say is that the food in the restaurants was all very good we did enjoy those all in all , that was our 2nd time at a sol melia resort and we will never go to any sol melia resort again 
my wife and i stayed at the melia for 10- days from 5/18 to 5/27 the resort is aesthetically pleasing , but is entirely too big it is enormous the shuttles that are provided to take you from place to place run few and far between , and , even with royal service , transportation is difficult the lobby is entirely too far from the beach with too may structures and too much vegetation in the path to get a breeze , making it stiffling we stayed in the casino/sports bar to get the a/c walking to the beach is out - of - the - question , unless you love to walk our friends did not upgrade , and had the same exact room , and the same service , and were closer to the beach save having access to the gabi club , royal service is a complete waste of money safes do not come with the room , unless you have royal service , $2 oh , and men , do not bother trying to wear sandles to any of the a la carte restaurants we were banned from one on the first day , and told it is unacceptable footwear for gentlemen so , we ended up wearing sneakers to dinner every night all in all , not bad , but we will not return there we 've been to punta cana three times , including this one , and enjoyed the other two very much the majestic colonial and secrets excellence are better , in my opinion 
bad wedding location i have very mixed emotions about the melia hotel i have stayed there twice and have had great experiences w/ the stays , but when problems arise they are big and once home ( out of the dominican ) there is nothing you can do about them i am a bride who wed there in december my husband and i wanted to make sure the resort was the place for our guests so we visited the march before to check out the place we loved it there and decided it was were we wanted to exchange vows we had 45 guests attend our wedding bringing the resort a significant amount of revenue for the off season the wedding planner at the resort is very overworked so getting everything planned was difficult and down to the wire i will give her credit that she does a good job , but the support staff is lacking our wedding was scheduled for 4:00, but due to resort delay ( they would not tell us why there was a delay ) it did not start until 4:50 the day up to the point of the wedding was beautiful w/ no weather problems unfortuantely for us , by the time the resort got to putting on the wedding a storm was coming in our wedding ended up being very wet from the rain due to the storm , our ceremony was about 5-10 minutes long w/ everything cut significantly short , no video or pictures of the wedding due to the rain , and being pronounced man and wife before the exchange of vows by the wedding planner ( not the minister ) we stayed at the resort for about 4 days after the wedding and were not able to get anyone there to discuss the problems w/ us all we were told is that it was 'their ' fault we filed a formal complaint at the resort thinking we would at least be contacted to discuss w/ no luck we requested a refund on some of the services that we paid for , but were not provided given the weather through our wedding planner in the states we were able to get in contact w/ the director of all melia weddings and thought that we were getting somewhere w/ our complaint she 'seemed ' understanding of the fact that this was our wedding day and was ruined by no fault of our own things were going well until a couple of months ago when she just stopped returning our e - mails my message to those wanting to be married at the melia is - - - do not do it even though the flowers were beautiful and it was a great resort for a vacation w/ families and friends , the overall stress of the wedding there is not worth it they run by their own clock if you do decide to get married there though , make sure that all issues are resolved before leaving the resort as once you are back home you are ignored if something goes wrong and you have a complaint , make yourself vocal we were too understanding and were hoping that things would be taken care of when we got back i truely believe that if we would have made a vocal complaint in the lobby were other guests could have 'heard ' , the resort would have taken care of the issues we even tried to dispute the credit card payment , but due to international laws american express was unable to assist us instead of the $1,000 refund due to services not provided all amex could do was give us a $75 credit at the same time my message for those looking for an affordable vacation , i would say go and have a great time the resort has a lot to offer and we had a great time w/ our friends and family members the grounds are beautiful and we loved the food at all the restaraunts i have recommended people go there for their honeymoon w/o concerns it truely is a beautiful place just remember , if problems arise , make sure they are solved before coming home 
not too pleased this time we stayed at melia caribe royal service from 4/11 - 4/25/2007 this is the second visit we have had to melia caribe we stayed for 10 days last april and i wrote a glowing review of our stay last year we had such a great time that we returned there again this year the difference was like night and day we booked through liberty travel months ago and had asked my agent to call them while i was there to make sure that i was reserving for the same type of a room that i had last year i had had a master suite in the rs section last year when i looked at the room accomodations this year , it seemed that the wording was a little different so that is why i had my agent call she asked them to check to see what type of room we had last year and that was what i wanted this year so everything seemed good we also requested a balcony overlooking the pool in the rs section i thought that since we would be staying for 2 weeks and dropping a ton of money , we would probably get the room choice we wanted when we arrived , we found that we were given what they call a master suite this year it is a smaller suite and is situated at the ends of the separate royal service buildings our first room that they brought us to overlooked the back of the resort i refused it , went back to the rs lobby and they assigned another room when we went to see that one , it overlooked the street at the end of the rs , but was still a smaller end room i went back and said that i had requested a master suite overlooking the pool they said all those rooms were already reserved i said , yes , i am one of the people who reserved one they then said i asked for a master suite and not a one bedroon master suite ( that is where the different naming convention this year comes in i told them how my agent talked to them , with me sitting right next to her , and she insisted that what i booked is the smaller room she said there would be no bigger rooms opening til 4/20 and if we wanted one , it would cost us an additional $800 i told them no - way , and went back to my room and called my agent she called them and the management would not move on its stand no new room for us or no upgrade offered ok , so we settled down in our small room , ordered piillows they did not come til we were in bed at 11pm next morning , the maid takes them away so i ordered them again in early morning by 9pm , they still had not come so i called again and was told they would be ther so i called the next day and again , they came around 10:30 at night so the next morning , and every morning after that , i hid the pillows in my suitcase so , if you want to keep your extra pillows , i would suggest you hide your pillows daily the third day we were there , i knew that some new email buddies ( that i had influenced in their decision to come to melia caribe ) were arriving after they had checked in , i found that they had booked junion suites , but were upgraded , at no extra cost to the one bedroom master suites which supposedly none were available when i had asked 3 days earlier spoke with another couple who decided that the tropical side of the resort was not what they wanted , so they were able to upgrade at an extra $15 a day to the rs master suites we were not offered that either my birthday was on sunday so on friday my husband went to the rs desk to book a birthday cake for me he spoke to someone over 1/2 hour and they wrote everything down the cake was booked for sunday night and all we had to do was call the restaurant on saturday for our sunday night reservation so we reserved ma maison , where the cake was supposed to be well , you guessed it , they had no notification of a cake so we went to the rs lobby after dinner , and they looked through their books , and nothing was written went to dinner one night and the girl would not let us in she pointed to the picture on her podium ( which looked like a pcture of mens shorts ) and said he could not come in with shorts yet shorts are allowed for men , just no open toed shoes for men so we left my husband had worn dress shorts to all the other restaurants with no trouble so the next day , i went back to the podium and noticed that the picture was not of shorts , but of bathing trunks my husband did not have bathing trunks on he had on dress shorts so we made the reservations for the same restaurant the next night , he wore the same thing , and the same girl let us in this time with no trouble one more reservation glitch ( they had nothing written down for us in their book ) at capri the night before we left so all in all , melia caribe ruined our vacation this time the waiters and room staff were wonderful , the weather was wonderful , the beach and pool was wonderful , the food was good , but the glitches were incredible in addition , their free for rs guests internet computers were down from wednesday when we arrived , to sunday , and then went down again the second week we were there and , they would not give the rs people ( who are supposed to get this service for free ) a voucher to use at the pay for internet in the other part of the hotel the tv 's acted up for the whole complex multiple times and the room we were in was right next to the back of the entertainment area so if we did not go to the shows at night , it was ok , cuz they sounded like they were in our front room every night so , sorry to have rambled on , but i was sooooo disappointed this time and believe it or not , i never complain about anything i was very polite with my requests and never yelled but we were going to look at and probably buy a vacation rental club unit or suite cuz we had thought we would like to go back every year but , as of the first days glitches , we said no way i feel that there must be some new administration there this year cuz i certainly got shafted my travel agency is also quite upset with them so if you go there , i hope you have a great time like we had the first year cuz once the mistakes happen , they seem to snowball 
kids club review the mini club , which is for 4 months to 4 years old was dark , cold , small and boring for kids that were 2 to 4 it was a perfect spot for parents to leave their infants during the hot hours of the day at the resort the nannies seemed perfectly content to sit on the small kids couches , shaking the babies in the infant chairs or rocking them to sleep , but could care less about entertaining the bigger kids in this category the gap in the level of interaction was noticed by other parents of kids who were hoping for more activities/toys/games/entertainment for their kids of this age we went around the rules a bit and became friends with one of the babysitters who watched the older kids if she could clear permission with the mini club babysitters , she would keep an eye on our daughter while she played on the juggle gym outside with a few older kids we did not keep our daughter in the mini club for more than 2 hours at once and that was on one day we just felt sorry for her we , her parents , were hoping to get some time alone to read and reconnect , but our vacation shifted and it became an all out find ways to entertain the kid kind of vacation we would 've gone to disney or done something else we ended up buying an inflatable floaty for the pool - - they do not provide them , you have to bring your own took train rides , went to the beach - - the caribe lobby gift shop sells floaties and sandbox toys , for an outrageous price occassionally , we spent a few hours in the room because it became too hot to let her run at full speed outside even the kids club , for 5-9 year olds , kept the kids in the shade doing crafts until the heat dissipated around 3pm that was not what i was hoping for being on vacation in the caribbean for the 5 year olds and up , the parents were estatic they could not get their kids to out of the kids club there are so many activities for these guys - - a lot we felt could 've have been tailored for the mini club kids we were envious that for the kid 's club age group they had taken so much care to provide a decent set of activities , while the 2-4 year olds were stuck inside left to argue over a few toys - - literally this is a tough age ( temper tantrums , the ever present 'mine ' attitude , the energy that could power three utility companies ) and there were babysitters who clearly did not want to play with the kids they wanted to watch them from a chair in the room my husband stayed behind often playing with our daughter until she became distracted with a few toys or made friends with another kid , and once the babysitter , who i guess was tired of his presence , told him the parents were required to leave after 10 minutes he told her point blank that he was waiting for her to engage the kids she responded it 's tiring yeah we know this is not home where we can pull out a box of toys or go to the park or turn on little einsteins we took playdough , crayons , swim gear , sandcastle building stuff but she wanted her bike , her play kitchen , her legos , etc , which was the gap we were hoping the mini club would fill i mean , buy some legos our daughter did not entirely hate the mini club she asked us to go once a day because she wanted to hang out with other kids or go on the slide - - the big playground , but we could not imagine she 'd be happy for more than 2 hours at a time , and quite often she was at the door waiting for us to come back , which just killed ( there is this amazing playground outside with a padded floor and no way for them to hurt themselves on it they ca not fall off or get stuck ) they do not provide lunch or snacks for the kids , you have to bring diapers , snacks and their sippy cup , which we put in a little bag with our contact info in it we would tell the babysitters where we were going to be and they could care less on to the babysitters my husband and i did get to go out a few nights we would not have done this unless we had found the best babysitter we 've ever had her name is zuleica olea we met two others and let one of them babysit our daughter on a night zuleica could not make it but we were home after two hours we rushed through dinner i do not remember where we went the great thing is that the hotel , once you arrange for a babysitter through guest services , alerts ground security to this arrangement , which made us feel better overall , that section of the resort , which was the tropical side , was just ok our room 's sink was always clogged , the beds were crazy uncomfortable - - we stayed in the family suite - - our door keys never worked in the door - - we had to jump into the balcony to break into our own room maintenance came out three separate times to fix it , etc and if it rains the walkways on the grounds are like ice it 's ridiculous the paddle boats , catamarans and kayaks were always booked the restaurants , where you have to make reservations , were always booked - - but you could still get in if you called at 3pm it was a pain to make it back to a hotel phone to call in that reservation at 3pm the upside is if you have young kids who you know are going to make a mess of things everywhere they go then you can overlook a few things like key cards and boring kids clubs we had fun with each other and made our own experience there we did not get sick from the food or water we did not see any bugs , rats , spiders , etc we saw a frog , a bunch of lizards the grounds are lush and the sea was amazing they have photographers walking the grounds so you can get a nice family photo yeah there are peddlers of every tchotcke you can think of , but dominicans are so friendly you do not mind taking a few minutes chatting with them and that 's really the highlight : we never met a staff person in a bad mood everyone always had a smile , which at times made all the difference 
great vacation , so so accommodations my husband and i just returned from the melia caribe tropical after a 1 week stay ( apr 19-27) when we arrived at the resort at 11am check in was quite chaotic , there was no check in desk only a table with 5 or 6 employees a stack of room keys and a fist full of bracelets when we originally booked through our agent we were supposed to have a deluxe jr suite on the caribe side , what we got was a room which i described as reminents of the cuban missle crisis ( i will explain further ) i do have to say arriving at the resort so early in the day we did get a room right away which alot of other new guests did not get here is a breakdown of our opinionrooms : our room was ready right away , it was on the second floor , and within a 2 minute walk to both pools and the beach , as well as being across the lane from the turey buffet but the tiles on the floor were at one time polished marble but like i said earlier about the cuban missle crisis when you entered the bathroom you had to step down about 2 inches , and after the first shower i realized why , flood , flood , flood we had 2 double beds in the room but they were more like oversized twin beds , our fridge was stocked with water and pop daily , but unfortunalty there was no waffle mix provided for the waffle iron in the room , [ - - ] i would have much preferred a coffee maker for the first 4 days the maid service sucked by the 3rd day i had to resort to taking toilet paper from the pool at night , and i made beds , and most days our rooms were not even cleaned until after 4pm on the 4th day there must have been a shift change becuase the maid service drastically changed , clean towels , 2 rolls of tp and the floor was mopped and the bedding changed when i called the front desk to tell them we were in the tropical and were supposed to be in the caribe and wanted to be moved to what we had paid for a month and a half in advance the answer was no , no reason given just no food : the food was very good with lots of selection at the buffets for breakfast lunch and an afternoon snack the a la cartes were difficult to get a reservation before 9pm but we were told by the first air transat rep that was becuase 1/2 the seats were reserved for the royal service but after 2pm what ever was not booked by rs was released to everyone else we at the chinese , the italian , mexican , and the american all were very good bar service : the alcohol flowed freely with quite a few name brands and there was never a wait for drinks and the staff were very friendly and i found there was never a language barrier with any of the staff with the exception of the first maid both were equally beautiful with lots of chairs , i heard people complaining about seaweed on the beach but i did not find that there was alot but being from ns seaweed is not an issue for me air transat rep : alain is his name and if you have a problem like being in the wrong section of the resort , good luck finding him , even though his book says he is going to be at the desk for 2 hours a day he was 't there for us , we travelled with 3 other couples and each one of us got tired of waiting for him for more than an hour on the designated days , i did catch up with him on the last moring i was there and he was dealing with 2 other couples who just so happened to have the same problem as we did ( go figure ) and his excuse for us not catching each other was in a rather rude tone  i ca not work every day , i need a day off too you know i would love to have job where i only have to work 2 hours a day and then not even show up beware the guys in the white golf shirts hanging around the lobby and the buffets they will hound you until you forcefully tell them to leave you alone , they are selling time shares and for $325usd per month for 10 years you can become a member of the sol melia family oh and hey you get a free t - shirt this resort is quite large and if you do not like to walk than this is not the place for you , the gardens and roaming birds are nice but not nice enough for me to return to this resort 
lovely place , but prob not going back hello all we stayed at the melia caribe tropical for 6 days from 4/20 to 4/25 i 'll try to write an objective review despite the fact that my husband and i are still sick with traveler 's gastric issues after being home for four days this has never happened in our travels and we 've been to several countries/islands in the last 8 years we also had a petty theft ( and we live in nyc and have never been robbed ) and we did not have great weather i 'll also try to write a thorough review as i have appreciated the time other travelers have taken to inform me in the past i 've posted this with headings so if you 're not interested you can skip over some parts arrivalthe arrival at punta cana airport was unremarkable and similar to other 's reports we purchased a $10 00 tourist card and then stood in a long line to hand it over to someone a few feet away who also stamps your passport i recommend one of you get in the line for the tourist card and the other start to wait in the custom 's line to save time the airport is charming , open construction with thatched roof there is no jet way you walk to the main terminal after descending the stairs from the plane the airport is very clean and simple and there is the steady beat of island drums and costume - clad young girls to welcome you to the facility transferwe had pre - booked a roundtrip transfer with our trip and we found the booth quickly and were escorted to a modern , clean van it was extremely humid that day and they put the ac on quickly for us we got to the hotel in about 20 minutes or so check - ini took note from someone else on these boards and visibly placed a $5 00 bill on top of my reservation papers on the counter when i spoke to the front desk clerk my intention was to have a room near the pool and beach since that was our primary reason for visiting at first he gave us a room near the lobby/restaurants but i asked him to look again he did and gave us an ideal location ( building 27) that is near the caribe beach , pool and one of the beach grills he smiled as i slid the $5 00 bill over to him after he assigned us a good location we were greeted immediately with cold beer and fruit punch upon check - in a young woman approached us under the guise of welcoming us to the resort and insisted we would receive a welcome package and gift by visiting a desk just past the check - in she walked with us a bit and was very charming when i realized that we were being escorted to the time share desk we politely declined and wished them a nice day and walked away towards our room the time share sales people were certainly present often through our visit , but we found that by simply raising our hand and smiling no that they did not press us it was not as irritating as i feared it would be by reading some of the previous reviews roomwe had a deluxe junior suite which was fine the room was very clean , a decent size with a small couch , lounge chair , desk and coffee table the ac worked very well , the decor was tasteful and fresh and we had a little terrace overlooking a garden area the bathroom is fairly large and has a bidet the tub is pretty high which could be tricky for a senior citizen or a short person like me : ) we were given a bottle of rum and some little soaps and a heart - shaped candle the first two days of our visit we paid the $2 00 a day to use the safe i found it necessary to actually place a reminder paper note over the spigot in the sink because after a night out or when you 're tired it could be asy to brush your teeth with the water or drink from it accidently the room did have a strong musty smell - - but there was no mold anywhere i brought some spray perfume and sprayed when we got there i have asthma and was worried about the mold - - but i had not problems - - although i took precautions by using my inhalers for a week before the trip getting aroundit was very humid for most of our stay and although we 're typically very big on walking , we found ourselves taking the little train around the resort most of the time the cobblestones were not comfortable to walk on - - even with rubber soled shoes and when they are wet they are extremely slippery the train came often and it was fun at first it was a nice chance to chat with others at the resort and learn about their stay and recommendations it can be a little confusing at first to figure out where you 're going - - but someone on the train always knows and can tell you sometimes we 'd just ask the train driver before we got on how many stops to ___ and they 'd usually be able to communicate that to us several times we got picked up at the little train stop by some of the royal service guys on the golf carts when they 're not busy shuttling people they randomly stop and ask if you want a ride they were always good spirited and sweet and we tipped them a buck or so foodwe 're foodies who live in nyc and we tried to mentally adjust to prepare for okay food the food would be comporable in our opinion to lower level catering food - - with a couple exceptions that were better for example , the japanese restaurant - - which was fine there was no great food to be had anywhere and we did not really expect that ( the pizza at the beach grill was pretty good ) the a la carte restaurants were really pretty - - lots of ambience and beautiful architecture they really have so much of this right except for much of the food is overcooked or tough and the sauces are either bland or sugary i really think if they get the right food manager in this place it could make a huge difference the menu is fairly sophisticated and the presentation is nice the service was fine - - the wait staff were extremely sweet and were working their butts off to keep everyone happy i was dismayed to see many people not leaving any tips for them at all we felt that $2-3 for a dinner was not a lot to us but cumulatively could mean a lot for these hard - working people the buffets were where we suspect we got sick the food is left out in open air - - not air conditioned and it 's just a stomach issue waiting to happen we tried to choose the things that were being made fresh - - omlettes , pizza , etc but something got us good we drank the bottled water , etc but by day 2 my husband was sick and by day 3 i was sick we spoke with several other people during our stay who had the same issue this and the size of the resort would be the reason we would not return we realize this could happen anywhere - - but when we spoke to others with the same issue - - it made us think twice if resorts like this want to attract more of the american market , they 're going to have to take far greater steps for precautions against traveler 's illness - - much like mexico has accomplished in their tourist districts we lost our appetite and felt somewhat lethargic and it really took a lot away from our trip and we 're the glass is half full type people getting reservations at the a la carte was a bit of a pain in the butt it takes about 20 minutes to get through to the reservations line however , we do not mind eating late and were able to get 9 pm reservations where we wanted to go on most nights pool and beachwe were on the caribe side ( and yes there are more children on the tropical side ) and the pool is truly fantastic 
should have stayed home i did not choose this destination , it was a company trip for my husband i did not want to go after reading all the horrible reviews but decided to go for him check in was done for us by the companies travel agent so we did not have to stand in line for that , however , it took my husband three trips to the lobby to get our room key to work we did not have rs and the rooms were not to our standards very old looking the resort is very large , i did not take the train because i did not like the stop and go so i walked which was ok with me the food was horrible at all the restaurants i was not impressed with any of it i did not have any problems with the people working there they were friendly for the most part the grounds were nice the beach is just a beach i prefer hawaii to the caribbean overall , if you just want to sit and do nothing for awhile then this place is good i was too bored with nothing to do for five days and i did not feel like it was safe enough to venture outside the resort 
good vaca sandwiched in between two big problems my wife and i stayed here from the 13th through the 18th of april we stayed at the bahia principe in may of 2006 when we finally arrived to the resort after 10 hours of travel ( layover in atlanta ) , the lobby was somewhat chaotic come to find out they did not have a room for us claiming the computers were down which allowed the hotel to overbook not talking a couple of rooms here they overbooked by about 10% we had booked two and a half months in advance of our arrival they took us into a room only to find out that we were being sent to the paradisus punta cana which was a melia property they did not disclose to us exactly where this property was located they made it seem like it was the paradisus palma real next door there were eight friends meeting us down there the next day so we thought this would be ok for a night they stressed that when we returned the next day , we would be over - compensated in some way got in the taxi and he passed up the palma real driver said they had paid him to go to the paradisus punta cana we asked donde esta paradisus punta cana 20 minutes north long story short here , we returned the next day after feeling like we missed an entire day and there was no compensation except they gave us a vip bracelet which turned out to get us nothing no room upgrade , nothing in the room all we wanted to do was enjoy the remainder of our short stay , so we basically let it go the beach was fantastic water was relatively calm when compared to when we stayed last year at the bahia food was better here than at the bahia reservations were a joke for a large group mostly 10:00pm reservations we were able to sneak a 7:30pm reservation in at the american grill which by they way , our entire group enjoyed the most , contrary to other reviews here we also ate at the seafood ( not bad we were there for about three hours before we finished ) , italian ( ok as well ) and the rest of the time was spent at the buffet , which we thought was pretty good for a buffet spent most of our nights at the lobby bar which was fun waitresses joked with us and bartenders came to recognize us we tipped there just like we were here in the states and they certainly like that on the occasions we did not tip , service level remained relatively the same casino was ok and much bigger than the one at the bahia did not play at all and those in our group that did , lost every night our last full day there it rained for basically the entire day kind of a bummer but we made the best of it when we got back in the evening to get ready for dinner , there were multiple cracks in the ceiling and would not you know it , our bed was soaking wet along with the floor and bathroom called x3000 and they said they would send a guy 30 minutes later , no guy called again and they said we should personally go down to the lobby we did this and they said they would have to send a guy we pleaded that this was our last night and we would just like to switch rooms of course , their answer was , we do not really have any rooms left they did option us the the paradisus punta cana again and they really just set us off then miraculously , a room became available this took about two and a half hours out of our last night there in no way was there any compensation for we had gone through neither the first night there nor the leaky ceiling we always had thought , this kind of stuff would never happen to us and then it became reality so all in all a good vacation sandwiched in between a couple of major complaints we are currently trying to contact the corporate office but we are not expecting a return call or e - mail of any sort if they run corporate like they do the melia caribe tropical if you return to the website where you booked your vacation and the hotel shows no availability , be cautious 
will not return the resort was overbooked during our stay check - in was a nightmare booking a reservation in a la carte restaurant was possible but what we found was that booking activities at the resort and actually honoring a reservation are two different things on more than one occasion members of our group made reservations for dinner or some other free resource ( paddle boats , kayak , etc ) only to find , for one reason or another , our reservation would not be honored be prepared to tip to get any service let alone good service i will never return 
middle of the road upon arrival to melia cabri tropical , we were pleased - very very clean , open resort the language barrier is tough - not many on staff speak even broken english the check - in process was terrible and the staff were not helpful at all - very lax our initial villa ( #20) was nice , but too far from the beach , so the following day we moved closer to the beach area ( #33) - due to the size of the resort , it was a good 10 minute walk from villa #20 to the pools/beach so we were happy to move but , our new villa did not have ac and while they assured us they were working on it , that never happened as well , there were a few ants ( maybe to be expected in such a tropical place ) but overall , not the worst but not 5 star ( maybe 3) the food ( lunch/breakfast at the buffett ) was good - they had it all , pizza - hamburgers - hot dogs - chicken - fries - and the list goes on if you ca not find something you like , you 're too picky to be leaving your own kitchen as well , the ala cart restaurants were good ( make reservations the day of dinner , not the night before ) - the american grill was fantastic ( the chix wings were awesome ) but the french restaurant was bad - the lobster was terrible but ca not win them all , got try them out and find what you like ( the mexican was good too ) the pool area was great - bartenders friendly the drinks were good - beers beer the mixed drinks were a bit sweet but it depends on the bartender great weather - friendley people - and the spa was nice too ( for adults , go to the pool next to the spa , it 's quiet , not crowded and relaxing overall , a good trip but do not fall prey to the time share nazis that try and get you to tour their royal service hotel (2 hrs ) and buy into it for thats right , for a mere $325 00/mth for 10yrs you can become a royal service member have fun - bring lots of sun block and do not drink the water 
if you do not like to walk , do not go here the hotel is a very clean place , the biggest problem was the walking and then there was trying to get reservations for the ala carte restaurants they tell you to phone between 9 pm and 11 pm for the next day , but most of the time they do not answer the phones , try calling at 2pm for the same evening worked alot better for us when going on the flee market scene on the beach go to the green mall they are alot more willing to barter then the first 4 or 5 stores the flee market that happens on the resort is very expensive not very good deals at all all in all the resort was good the alcohol was not the people you meet there from all over the world are awesome , but i wo not be going back to this particular resort 
some of the good , some of the bad we just returned from our trip yesterday and wanted to write before i forgot it is helpful to have some opinions of others our stay in the dr was average the weather was just perfect , with a constant light breeze not a drop of rain first of all if you are with kids , it becomes difficult there are alot of families , so very kid friendly so big that you or the kids could become lost just going to the bathroom forget about it if you have to leave the beach for a drink , your not coming back for awhile we stayed in royal service , worth the money ca not imagine the service without it the service is the worst that we have every experienced the language barrier is terrible if you do not speak spanish , your in trouble it is not a requirement to speak english or another language nobody ever has a smile on their face , it was if you were a bother to them we ate breakfast in the same place every morning , and everyday it took 30 minutes just for a cup of coffee if you wanted something , you needed to get it yourself ( that was with royal service ) do not wear anything but flats , walking off your food is no problem all you did was walk they had a tram , but between the fumes in your face and the pace of about 1 mile an hour , you were better off walking so all that food and drinking , not one pound of weight on over all i will not go to the dr again , definitely not the melia caribe depending on your standards is how i recommend this resort high standards do not even consider i am not bitter about my trip , just disappointed in the resort 
overall nice resort i went with my fianc? , just the two of us for a relaxing vacation over all this resort was very nice the grounds were kept very beautiful the beach was well kept , although with some seaweed in the way **the main issue we had was the time - share agents i think they were being paid on commission they simply would not leave us alone this one guy would show up everywhere we went in the resort even the beach we found this to be the main issue , because we came there with the intentions of relaxation and unwinding from the stresses of nyc i even had to call the guy a stalker because i felt he was we tried to be nice at first and explain that we were not interested in buying or looking at the time - share properties they made it seem like it was a necessity to set up this appointment to see it anyway , the resort restaurants where very good the seafood dinner happened to be our favorite we did find a restaurant called the los dos , which was not listed as a dinner restaurant it is for couples only , a very nice outside area , close to the dominican restaurant they had a very good lobster appetizer the buffets were pretty good , variety lots of flies so i became picky about what i chose , they should have more nets or covers over the food because of this problem i tried to get things as they were placing them out , to ensure the food was ok to eat the set up with the three trains was a cute and good idea , however a couple of times we had to walk to our destination because of the trains breaking down hint sit in the back because of the smell of the train , really bad cute flintstones characters , i got a pic with fred cute for the kids they staff was generally friendly and tried their best to speak english for us the room was well kept , very pretty you may want to bring your own pillow , the offer very little pillows for a king sized bed we would go back to this resort , as long as the price was good , but it is not our first choice once before , and the beaches are always nice and the grounds are always very well kept they keep lots of landscapes and natural trees , which is nice for a resort contact me if you want pics or info 
the resort was well kept and clean but there were a lot of negatives about this resort please take this seriously as we were very disappointed the check in took over an hour they did not seem to be in any hurry to get you checked in we had to wait for over an hour after check in b/c our room was not ready ) we got there too late the first night so we were made to eat the buffet buffets are bad and this one was no exception the next night we got reservations but the times are limited 5 or 10 pm all of the places are not full they just do not want you to get a time slot b/c they would rather you eat at the buffet the food selections when you got a reservation was extremely poor reservation times are 9-11pm the night before you are supposed to relax on vacation not stress out about the thought of eating at the buffet if you do not call right at 9pm the night before there were 6 of us that stayed here and all of us were ill at some point throughout the week during the lunch buffet had to eat plain pasta and popcorn b/c all the other food was exposed to flies that were crawling all over the food the food was not high quality milk at breakfast was not refrigerated - it was sitting out in pitchers at dinner a choice would be even tell you what kind of fish it is the entire dining experience was not pleasant ) drink selection they had one kind of beer all fruity drinks were made from concentrate forget about fresh oj they had liquor but then all the mixers were horrible we were purchasing drinks at the golf course and bringing them back to our rooms not what you expect for all inclusive the concrete/rock paths that they paint with yellow high gloss paint are very slippery , especially by the pools i slipped on the 2nd day and split open my knee and had a bruise on my elbow the size of a softball i heard of multiple other guests that experienced the same thing one woman sprained her wrist please take this seriously - i wish i had believed the bad reviews prior to our vacation i talked with another couple and they recommended the excellence spend the money as it would be worth it better food , better selections 
punta ratta in a paragraph or two the title will become obvious : i was reluctant to post such a bad review , but my friends urged me to do so with the hope of saving others from the misfortunes that befell my family the first night consisted of minor inconveniences , i the toilet in our room did not work and there was only one bed in the room my teenagers were in so my six foot three son ( the younger one ) slept on the couch he woke up with insect bites all over his body the next night after a day in the sun and mediocre food we returned to the room to sleep at about one o 'clock am i was awakened to the screams of my wife there was a rat on her arm in bed she flung it off and i chased it into the closet housekeeping sent someone up with a towel to catch it , but he was gone into a crevice behind the closet all night we could hear him clawing at the glass door the next morning we were moved to two new suites with a complimentary fruit and cheese plate and some wine and with the assurance that we would be taken care of before we left with ten minutes to go to catch the shuttle to the airport they wanted me to sign a paper saying we would take one free night in return for our  inconvience the manager , a teutonic gentleman , said ,  you come to the dominican republic and you do not expect to see rats i replied , not in my room , on my wife 's arm , i do not when i told him i saw three others he said that was because i was looking for them we declined the offer my travel agent on long island said she would never send anyone there she got them to up there offer to three nights , room only , no meals i said forget it i will never stay at a sol melia property again such callous disregard for guests is something i could never tolerate i am a world traveler , not a complainer the food was mediocre , as i mentioned with pork chops as a prime example served three different ways depending on the restaurant french with cream sauce italian with tomato sauce and mexican with tomato sauce and peppers there was such a lack of imagination you may think this story was horrible enough , but it is not over we had jewelry and perfumes stolen from our luggage at the airport and were sold counterfeit cigars that were worthless punta ratta , at sol melia tropical was the trip from hell 
the camp a nightmare we stayed in royal service and thank god we did if not you are forced to eat at these terrible buffets as i heard from the other guests it is very hard to get reservations at the restaurants and i could see must people in the resturants were from royal service the royal service was excellent but the hotel was a liitle to large you most take a golf cart around my main problem was the camp we went with 3 other couples all with children ranging 2 - 10 the first day we left or kids at the camp it seemed very unorganized so we stayed close by at a near pool ( there are 3 large pools ) one hour after we dropped the kids off my 4 year old was wondering around the pool by himself he just walked out of the camp and when i went back to see what was going on they seemed not to understand my english very upsetting the reason we picked this hotel was because it had a camp that catered to younger children what if i was not close by the thought still disturbs me 
good but not great , full review melia caribe tropicali am leaving tomorrow to return from hotel back to usa and writing while fresh in my mind i will be writing from perspective of upper middle class american with family of 2 boys ages 13 and 9 who have traveled in caribbean - central american only , not world travelers , but who are accumstomed to nice places will try to be fair because many reviewers are very upset or very happy and we are in the middl had good time but not great compared to other islands beachpretty but not beautiful white sands and very nice but not like aruba , cancun , cayman for example water not as crystal clear but pretty could not see for very far under water like other islands lots of seaweed on beach not cleared as others say it was still quite around lying at water line royal servicewould not have been happy without this service much more expensive than regular stay but see website on hotel for size - amenities etc very large room about 600sqft separate room for parents with jacuzzi , shower , double bathroom safe worked very well , no problems room had flat screen tv?s with limited american channels which was good for kids whn they needed downtime and had disney channel etc the refrigerator was stocked with all kinds of alcohol and non alcohol had small kitchen , dining room , kids slept in converted sofa to bed at night good storage space for clothes nice room , cleaned in am and turned down with fresh towels in pm maid service was excellent dont drink water but use bottled water for brushing teeth and drinking this is provided in large quantities in room really like room right next to gabi club for rs only and pool for rs only very few people plenty of space and quiet and food and drink and towels no problems with towels any time use your towel card i agree with others that little english spoken we know some spanish but often had wrong orders or drinks etc and this upset my wife i am not brash american but for the money we spent we felt we would like to travel somewhere we we could be understood and in resorts i felt more english should be know to make us feel at home if you will rs good quality and good people for most part many others not in rs were complaining plus , rs got us dinner every night often at last minute at the alacarte restaurants which many people cant get rs has special transport , to special beach , roped off , plenty of chairs no fighting for palapas extra money , but oh the kids and wife liked the services and small amount of people we shared amenties with well worth the money foodhokkoido - - japanese fried rice and meats great salad , soup not great nice experience for kids desert was not what it we ordered but okay pagoda - - not good not at all like american chinese which we love none of the usual foods , appetizers like we know rice was given enough for 2 spoonfuls and we love rice with our chinese grill - - we go tonight gourmet - - very posh i liked the food steak - lobster was good for meat and terrible for lobster there is no lobster at this hotel like americans think of maine lobster few shards of lobster on any dish beautiful and nice food maison - - did not go tohacienda - - closest restaurant in hotel to the real thing loved the service , place atables - - did not gocapri - - did not go , seafoodla gondola - - italian appetizers set out on tables for all to try our dishes were good not great overall good experience kidsour kids did not go to club there are some jumpers , rock walls , outside activities we may do that looked good but cost money gift shopokay but not great new mall opened up next door to hotel willl try tonight vacation clubwe avoided the sales reps and they let us alone we didnt want the free massag and to waste our time we had a couples relaxing massage and they did a good job it was a gift from our travel agent we are not spa people but everyone was nice and professional barswe are not big on drinking , but they had anything we wanted beer is only el president no others they had mixed drinks and tropical drinks some have said to bring large insulated cups and we didnt more to pack and you can have as many as you want so i didnt see the need to have a jumbo container clubswe did not go to any shows or discos cant review this 
smack dab in the middle the prior reviews were on the money there are aspects that were good and others not so good having stayed in multiple solmelia properties , we were fairly confident of what we would find first , understand that the grounds are huge this is 2 resorts situated together , the caribe side and tropical side , each with 20 buildings melia?? other chain , the paradisus , is right next door we were a family of five , including kids , ages (9-4) the family suites are conveniently located near the pool and the beach , unlike royal service which is near the lobbies and requires a train or golf cart ride to get to the beach (5-10 min kids and evening meals - the agora , bar/food service , claims to only serve breakfast and lunch , but they also serve a kids buffet at night the other half of the facility is a for pay seafood restaurant this is a bonus and you can sign your kids into the kids club there and they will be taken to the main lobby for the kids mini disco or evening event fyi , you pick them up at the main lobby , unfortunately , they are not returned to sender you will need to learn that there are no fresh towels available after 3pm or so everyone seems to get new towels in the morning , so plan ahead water activities ? nice stuff , but you need to reserve a day ahead if you want a sailboat on days with a nice breeze , you most likely will not be sailing as they do not seem to allow the boats out sales people ? there are lots of people always milling about trying to sell you something they are relentless in their efforts and really quite a detraction the hotel seems to believe all travels have rolls of cash on them there are nice activities and items for sale , but credit cards are rarely accepted the water sports folks will not allow you to charge anything under $100 it costs $95 for parasailing , $85 before 11am , but you can?? pay with a credit card , only cash since it is less than the minimum want to get the kids out on a banana boat ride , oops , hope you have the $40 cash on the spot you get the pointbaby sitting ??he rates are $10 per hour for the first child , and $5 per hour for each additional child so our going rate was $20 per hour for a sitter who could not understand our children very frustrating for them and us as stated before , at other solmelia properties , we were provided with higher quality staff good size and outfitted well good luck if you want a reservation for a big party , say 8 or more people they will insist the only times available are 6 or 9pm we finally worked around this by making 2 reservations under different rooms for the same time and location you will also have to be a real phone jockey to get decent times you can begin to make reservations at 9pm the night before , but be fore warned , you will be pressing the redial button a lot internet - $4 for 15 minutes or you can purchase an all you can eat pass for $50 there is wireless available in some of the buildings , but they are located adjacent to the business center lobby forget about the emails from the balcony while admiring the beach extensions to remember :6313 ? service expressin summary , the staff really does try to serve you , but you will be disappointed sometime set your expectations accordingly , bring more cash than normal and you will have a perfectly fine time don?? forget the pepto , you will most likely need it 
do not get married here nice place otherwise my wife and i got married here last december while everyone had a good time , the organization of the resort and service from management was horrendous do not get married here 1) we had problems reaching the resort through the entire planning process no voice mail for wedding coordinator , no e - mail responses , nobody else to talk to they have one woman who handles all the wedding plans there she is worked to death they need at least 2 more people to help 2) the wedding started 45 minutes late and ended up taking place in a rainstorm the ceremony was thus very rushed and the wedding coordinator for the resort ended up pronouncing us man and wife , not the minister we paid for we have yet to hear why the wedding started late the rain is not the issue the issue is we had everyone sitting on the beach for 45 minutes with no idea what was going on bride and groom were notified only 10-15 minutes before schedule pickup time of the delay the picture package was not what we asked for form the photographer furthermore , we picked up the pictures from a guy who spoke very little english and his english seemed to get worse when he saw we had problems 4) we asked for credit from the resort for all the mishaps they said fill out a customer satisfaction form and they would accomodate us back in the states now , we have yet to get any kind of reimbursement and they 're making up these stories like they 're not even reading the complaint again , still no explanation for reason why the wedding started late the resort itself is very nice and as long as you do not need them to do something as important as a wedding , the place is fine lots of people get married there though and i hope i can save some people from going through the same problems we went through feel free to contact me with any questions we had a photographer not affilaited with the resort we used for our sunset cruise reception who did a phenomenal job and was priced significantly better than the resort i can give you his contact info 
worst resort i have ever stayed in this place was hands down the worst resort i have ever stayed i would never recommend this resort or even punta cana to anyone i know there are three positives of this resort :1 the beach is fabulous the sand is super soft , the water is calm , and the people watching is priceless the pool area is large and there is plenty of seating always available the grounds are beautiful and well kept maybe they could take a couple of those landscapers and put them behind a desk to help guests instead the negatives to highlight a few :1 service is non - existent we had priority check in b/c we were with a large group and that was still over an hour after the trek to our room , we found our keys did not work we never could get anyone to help us or bring us a new key the bartended looked at us like we had a third eye when we asked him to call the front desk after hoofing it back to the front desk , we waited another 30 minutes to get the new keys without so much as a sorry for the inconvenience food is horrible the buffets are at best filler the belly gets full but it has no taste the sit down dinners are marginal and the only way to get decent service is to give some nice tips to the waiter ahead of time making dinner reservations was a joke you could only make them the day of starting at 9 am well , at 9 am , they were all allegedly filled again they would ask you to call back at 3:30 or 4 pm to see if they could work you in amazingly enough , each day , they were able to work you in and then when you got to the restaurant all the tables were never full one day i had to call 4 times to get a table and then the restaurant was not even close to full all in all , when i am going to any type of resort , i am expecting service this place really needs some work 
believe the bad reviews we flew airtransat out of toronto actually over 60 of us travelled from across canada for our mid winter meeting all the bad reviews are true i did not choose this hotel or destination we were off for a 1 week business meeting and another week of vacation by day 4 the national association decided we would never return if i had to personally pay for this i would just be sick i think i figured out the problem of this hotel it has grown quickly too fast i understand last year they had 2 million guests , this year 3 million they do not have staff they do not have front desk people who know what they are doing they cannot make a decision , they get another person with a different decision , they get someone else until the manager comes out a manager one night will tell you something and a manager the next , a different story yes , i had fun yes it is the most beautiful property i have ever stayed on yes the staff you ran into on the grounds are lovely people however , i need a vacation from this vacation it was work to get a reservation for dinner for example three of us would call every morning approx 7 30am with a different room number to get a seat for dinner nine times out of ten we got the 9 45pm time slot this became hilarious and a daily joke i cannot imagine bringing children there in conclusion , i am still waiting for my washcloth 
some good , some bad this was our second stay at an all - inclusive , and some things were great , others bad this was the first vacation i can recall where everything seemed like it was really good or really bad very little that was in the middle first , the positives the resort is a short 20 minute cab ride from the airport ( $25 for up to four people ) the beach and pool areas are huge , and you could easily find chairs at any time of day even though the resort was full when we were there the beach and grounds are beautiful and the quality/selection of drinks at the bars was much better than the other all - inclusive we had stayed at the reservation - only dinner restaurants we ate at had great food , and the room was quite large with a nice balcony the wedding coordinator did a wonderful job with our friends ' ceremony and private reception the outdoor bar next to the american grill restaurant was a great place to hang out at night nobody tried to sell us on the timeshare club the whole time we were there , and the vendors selling parasailing and other water activities that cost money were not hassling guests on the beach at all unfortunately , there were a number of negatives check in/out were abysmally slow coming in , i was first in line and it still took 30 minutes to get checked in reservations for the restaurants were hard to get ( we did not stay in royal service , which apparently gives you priority ) , and then when you sit down to eat , the restaurant is only 1/3 full considering that there are tons of resort staff walking around , you would think they could add a few more front desk clerks and restaurant servers the buffets were the only option for breakfast and lunch , and alot of the food seemed to have been sitting out for some time and was cold the shower 's water temperature was nearly impossible to control - - sometimes it would come out hot and other times cold there is nothing to do outside of the resort that is within walking distance overall , it was a nice place to stay , but seemed a little pricey compared to other vacations we have taken , given some of the negatives definitely make sure you have some comfortable shoes , as you will be walking quite a bit if you do not want to wait for the train ( and with all we ate and drank during the trip , a little walking probably did us some good 
won us over after a bad start we 've just arrived back after a week at the melia , flying out xmas day and leaving on new years day we were most looking forward to spending some of xmas day on the beach with a cocktail , unfortunately this did not happen as there was no rooms ready on our arrival , we were not allocated a room until 5 some 3 hours after arriving at the resort and the sun was starting to set on finding our way to the room we were even less pleased to find that we had been given what may be the resorts only room for disabled persons there was no bath , the shower did not work the sink was lower and there were no work surfaces as was the toilet to assist disabled persons , i returned to the reception to tell them that we were not staying at this room only to be told that the property was 100% occupied and there was no other rooms available and added the old carribean reception clerks ' cliche of come and see me tomorow , he also advised me to call ext 30000 which i did and was told that someone would call round to assess the situation no sign of anybody within the next hour so we decided to go out and eat and maybe have a few drinks , after all this was our first xmas day away do not unpack the cases i told my wife , there is no way we are staying here , after all this was far from being a budget price break when we returned later that evening the shower had been repaired the following morning we had an important decision to make , do we put up and shut up ( our american friends would cringe at me even considering this option ) or do we spend another part of our holiday chasing up the thomsons rep and then waiting around while transfers to another room were arranged as we were only out there for 7 nights we went for the easiest option and although we were not happy with the principal issues there were things just outside the door , pools , beach , food , booze , sun etc that we had travelled such a long way to enjoy so off we went after taking all of them in we returned to the room which we only use for sleeping and getting changed in , to find a large basket of fruit , a bottle of wine with 2 glasses and a plate of king prawns , salmon , beef and other goodies on opening the fridge i found a bottle of champagne with 2 chilled glasses , although this to me did not mean all was forgiven it was a nice gesture but i must admit i phoned reception to make sure that we would not be getting billed for it as i thought someone may have made a mistake as it 's a long time since we were the honeymoon couple no sir it 's complimentary was the reply enough said , i 've been to better resorts but this one does have everything you need to have a good holiday , the food was okay , the pools are good , the beach is best i have seen and the majority of the staff are very helpful drinks are good most of the time but some of the barmen if you ask for a strong drink put extra ice in to make it look as if they are putting more licor in this does not happen in the avenue bar which is by far the nicest bar in the resort , ask for a strong drink in there and you will find yourself wondering if it was a good idea after - all , they also had some excellent evening entertainment in there but we only came upon this by chance as there did not seem to be any info boards mentioning this , the monsters ball was a good night with coffins and ghosts all over the place and then larger than life frankenstein , the hunchback , beetlejuice plus many others hanging out and dancing with each other and the guests , on another evening they had the resorts dancers trying to out - do each other , these guys can really dance especially the one in roller boots who zoomed in and out of the guests at what seemed like 50m this coupled with a balloon artiste making a selection of silly hats for us all to wear had the melia winning us over or was it them strong rum + cokes one problem here , no cola light or diet coke throughout the resort the other place for a decent drink is the caribe lobby bar , this is where the a your older more experienced barmen , the one 's who work hard and know how to get the tipping flowing , they find out how you like your drink and have it just right for you and usually ready on the bar before you ask we received this treatment every night in this bar whether we tipped or not , ca not say much for the evening shows apart from xmas night when they had about 40 dancers on the stage with candles doing a gospel choir version of silent night , very effective the casino , well it 's a casino , these people are trained to take as much currency off punters as they can , i have read other reviewers comments about the staff being unfriendly , this to me is normal in casinos , i think that they are told to concetrate and not smile too much or inter - act with the punters one more niggle that i have with this resort is the size of the palm trees , no do not laugh , if you are a dedicated sun - bather they will cause you much irritation , around the pool they look lovely but are all about 8 feet too high and everybody is constantly on the move to evade their shadows , this coupled with the slippery floor problem and believe me this is a serious slippery floor problem not just by the pool but throughout the resort especially after rain leaves me and a lot of guests that i spoke to of the oppinion that this is a good resort but could be much better to conclude i must comment that new years eve was the best i have experienced and i 've done 50 of them now the beach , a good band , drinks flowing , fireworks , what more can i say except the room number 2803, if you 're off to the melia memorise this number otherwise you will end up in this room with a large disabled sign on the door and the worst hotel bathroom i have ever encountered 
beautiful , crowded , nice staff , bad food , bad kids club , extortionate watersport we stayed for 2 weeks from dec 14 to dec 29 the hotel grounds are really beautiful , the staff is extremely friendly and want you to have a good time the beach is lovely and the pools are giant and uncrowded the food was terrible there is plenty of food , the qualiy is fine and no one got sick it just tasted bad the main buffets were ok , but the 9 specialty restaurants were just bad it is sad because they are elegant and fun and the menus seem like they will be great , but it is like no one is paying any attention to how it tatses the chinese restaurant is a particular abomination we were also really really dissapointed in the kids club the bam bam club for ages 5-8 was horrible the kids just sat around looking lost in a mosquito filled area made to look like a flinstones house should have been fun , but the staff had no idea how to get the kids involved a particular challenge as the big range of ages and languages required some one to energetically lead the cool club for older kids seemed like it had a good counselor and the kids were having fun 
the worst stay away this was the worst vacation experience i have ever had please search for  read the negative reviews for this hotel - pay attention to them i do not know why they seem to be from long ago , but believe me this place is hideous i have been all around the world and this is inexcusable first you need to know the food is inedible in the 20 hours we spent there , the only thing we could find to eat that was safe were 2 bags of peanut mm 's from the store , and an omelet from breakfast lunch and dinner were surprisingly hideous the smell of the food was bad enough , but i knew once i tasted it to not swallow we ran into several people who were violently ill one group had 6 out of 8 hospitalized they had no doubt as did i that it was due to the food i have read many of the negative reviews on this site ( hard to locate , but just search by negatives ) - there are so many reports of horrible food - - please do not disregard these we paid for first class plane upgrades to get out of there as fast as possible in case we were going to get sick as we wanted to be in an american hospital the hotel is pretty to look at , but huge and disorganized you can not find your room the signs are horrid , and the staff is not helpful they are disinterested and point you in the wrong direction many people are wandering around lost our room was totally musty smelling and they changed us ( but it took hours ) , and the next room while better was still hideous this was the worst vacation experience in my life , and it was totally due to the hotel soup to nuts it was hideous 
just alright well my family and i , kids 3 and 5 had an average stay we did not stay in the rs so keep that in mind when we arrived at our room we noticed the a/c did not work and the room had a very musty smell we went to go try get another room which is a 15 minute walk to get back to the lobby unless you wait for the train which will probably take the same time to get there as we were in building 26 close to the beach and main pool we were told to come back the next day and they did not have any other rooms except away from the beach and pool which we did not want with 2 small children just when we thought things could not get worse , when we took a shower the water was past our ankles , pretty disgusting the next day we were told the same and we did not move until the third day of our vacation after i became annoyed which i do not like to do they moved us after i asked the manager to come to our room and see how much he would like staying under these conditions you have to make reservations for the al a carte restaurants everyday and only at certain times what a pain and i am guessing if you have the rs it is a bit different but , that was a waste of time everyday at the pool you had to go and get your own drinks as they did not have any waiters or waitresses which was the same at the shows and hardly any staff at the bars to serve you you basically had to get your own drinks we have stayed at iberostar resorts before and wanted to try something different and all this resort did was confirm that iberostar for us is the way to go yes , we did enjoy the food , beaches and punta cana is very beautiful however , it depends what things are important to you and to us , room which by the way was just okay nothing great , service at the pool area and bars and booking restaurants once for your whole vacation like we were able to do at iberostar who also had staff available to serve you drinks are important and this resort just did if you have not travelled alot and just like an ok resort to stay at this would be a good place but , if you want to be spoiled and have those extra touches even though it costs more , iberostar will be our choice from now on once you get to the beach hang a right for about 10 minutes and you will find some shops for gifts , paintings etc but , it goes for awhile and head all the way to the end before you buy anything they are very pushy but , you can certainly get a bargain we are travelling with a big group next year and returning to punta cana but , to iberostar not this resort 
i just got back from punta cana , we stayed at this hotel and the service well , there is none we arrived on a bus from santo domingo ( the capital ) the ride was great , nice bus i told the driver that we were staying at the melia caribe , he said no problem we 'll stop at the entrance of that hotel so he did , we got off the bus right at the entrance of the melia complex where you can find the melia caribe tropical and the paradisus palma real we asked the guard to please have someone come to pick us up to take us to the lobby , it was a ten minutes walk , it was 2 p m ( very hot ) and we had our lugagge with us to this request he replied that they do not do that i was shoked he told us to call a taxi to take us in from the entrance to the lobby , i asked him to call the reception desk to confirm that we could not be helped , and sure enough they said take a taxi the guard then said that if we were paying extra for the premium service or if we had been staying at the paradisus palma real that they would had come to pick us up i came all the way to the dr and paid this hotel to remind me that i am not special during my vacation stay because i am paying the regular rate instead of the upgraded the guard called a taxi , the taxi driver found the ride so ridiculus that he did 't charged us ( we gave him the fare anyway us$5 this was the first day of our vacation , to say the least , not very relaxing and enjoyable ( i 've been in better ) the food was mediocre , and did i mention the service we stayaed for four days and i found 3 cocoroaches in my bedroom you 'll say it 's the caribbean , it 's normal i can qualify myself as a caribbean expert , i have traveled to almost every single island of the region and i can excuse one cocoroach one day , but 3 out of the 4 days i do not even want to imagine their kitchen area to me the overall experience was terrible , i think that for the money i could of done better in jamaica , cozumel , playa del carmen or cancun as a matter of fact i am done with punta cana , pretty beaches but the service it 's not there 
good but no way 5 star in low season we arrived on the 30th aug until 13th sept we did not go royal service as there were none available when we booked and did not know we could up grade when we arrived when we arrived after very long flight (10hrs + ) we had to wait in long queue to get booked in but once we got to our room we were happy all clean with flowers and full fridge etc we did not go out that night as children were tired so all just fell asleep ready for next day the next day we walked round to were the breakfast buffet was supposed to be to find out that they had closed that restaurant and moved it to a smaller one food there was very nice cereal and toast for kids as well as muffins , pancakes , waffles , bacon etc etc very big choice however when we settled down for our welcome meeting we found out that 4 of the nine alacarte were closed for low season and had been for a few weeks but just no one informed us the ones that were closed just happened to be the main ones we liked ( mexican , chinese , international ) so we were disappointed but thought thats one of those things and went off to the pool are two sections to the hotel the caribe side where we were staying and the tropical side both are supposed to have bars and shows and pools the caribe pool was brilliant as i have walking difficultys and was just recovering from a operation it was perfect because it meant i did not have to get the train ( which is very bumpy and falling apart ) and only had to walk about five minutes to it however on the 4th day there we went for lunch and came back to the pool to find the childrens pool taped off and within a hour of being in the bigger section the water level was going down then sure enough the next day the whole pool was drained and the restaurant by the pool closed no notices are warnings that it would be happening went up until 2 days after the event so as you can guess i was not happy it was now either get the train or walk for twenty minutes they said there was plenty off space around the pool at twelve noon but it was like 36 at that time so most people were getting lunch or in there rooms cause come 2pm the pool was full and it even had scuba diving training going on next to the kids swimming ( supposed to have there own pool but we never seen them use it ) summary of other snags we found that weren`t supposed to happen there is suppossed to be kids menus available in the restaurants we never got one once and there is certainly no themed area for kids there was icecream at lunch we thought it was vanilla until the kids said it tasted funny and we found out it was rum and rasin and the choclate one was alchol as well there is a kids icecream machine but it was out of service the whole wo weeks and on a night time in the buffet the food was lovely but again we could not find anything for the kids to eat other than the meat ( no plain potatoes or chips and the mashed had cheese on top ) no desserts at all for them at a night time either also like i said previously the tropical side was like a ghost town dring the day with only the little shop open until 5 ( both shops are supposed to be open until 10 30 the tropical side sells alot of medicines compared to the caribe so if you get ill after 5 and need something it tough luck and even the caribe was ireglar with staying open sometimes closing at 6 instead of 10 30) then at a night it was just plain spooky no lights nothing just pitch black so i would not venture there if i were you there is very little to do at a night the adult show does not start till 10 30 which is very late especially if you have children and have sat there through the kids show at 8 15 then have to keep them entertained until the other show starts we were going to be going over to the tropical side for the show there at 9 30 but that was not possible so spent most of nights back in the room by 9 it is still a very nice hotel i imagine in high season the hotel would be 5star with everything open but if you are going in the next couple months be prepared not to get what you paid for it only about a 3star low and mid season the staff are wonderful and if you have a nice smile for them and say hello they will do what ever they can to help you our room was always spotless and if you need your fridge filled up just leave a little note saying what you need because they do not check the fridge incase they infringe on privacy but tip tip tip just couple of dollars when you leave the note have photos or if anyone wants further info you can mail me at dawso_s@hotmail 
myself and my girlfriend arrived home today from the melia caribe with very mixed opinions of the resortwe went to the grand bahia principe last year and read bad reviews but rated it 5/5 because thats how we saw it different people will have different experiences but this is ours and what many others we spoke to experiencedfirstly il start with the good points1 friendly staff who cant always speak english well but try we rarely had problems with the language barrier rooms were reasonably large , clean and well maintained the maid spoke very little english but always greeted us with a smile and if we wanted anything in particular id try and point to whatever it was , bottle of 7up etc the grounds were immaculate with ponds and wildlife throughout4 at the beach we found alot of activities to join in with and had a laugh with the friendly staff we spent very little time at the pool as it was alot hotter and always busynow the bad basically the only bad thing was the food , however this one thing managed to ruin our holidayi have travelled to the dominican republic 4 times now and the food here was 10 times worse than anything else id previously experienced 95% of the food was luke warm at best , even in the a la carte restaurants would literally finish our starter , it would be taken over one shoulder as the main course was placed in front of us over the other was obvious that they had been waiting for us to finish , with the food sitting there and by the time we received it it was cold and disgusting i am not one to spit my food out but during our meal in the seafood restaurant i had to 4 times saying this tho another couple we met rated this as their best meal of the holiday maybe a bit hit and miss my advice would be to send anything back that does not arrive hot as it will cause you to be ill , i can guarantee that however the japanese was excellent and we had booked to go back there had i not been bed ridden with illness also as we arrived we were told that half of the a la carte restaurants were closed which we were not pre warned about between myself and my girlfriend we lost 6 days of our holiday and i was confined to the room for 2 days solid we were very careful with what we ate and never drank tap water i am no doctor but what i had was certainly food poisoning other couples that we met were also ill with one of the women not being able to eat or leave her room for 6 days , resulting with her having to spend 2 days in hospital on a drip lost all confidence in the food and ended up just eating crisps ( $6 a bag ) and simple things cooked in front of us , fried eggs on taost etcfinally try to ensure you have correct change when buying items from the shops as they will always claim not to have change and pocket the rest had the food of been better this review would have been a 4 or 5 but unfortunately i could not warrent any more than a 2 i will be complaining you have already booked then just be as careful as you can and take alot of imodium with you 
worst hotel ever bad , bad , bad too much to write place is huge , hot , and the service was , well there was no service if you are american they laugh at you and lie you will get sick from the food too 
some good and some bad we spent a week at this hotel mid august quick summary of the good and bad is as follows good points1) pool area was large , could always get a sunbed and swim up bar was good 2) beach was good nice white sand , lot 's of activities and right next to the hotel buffet restaurant and japanese restaurant were good casino was funbad points1) rooms were not well cleaned and maid service was really poor we had the same smears on the mirrors on the 1st day as we had on the last the patio doors were ripped out of the wall when the cleaners were changing the table and chairs on the balcony no attempt was made to correct it and the room was left unsecured vast array of restaurants but most were disappointing avoid the chinese and french at all costs often found the reservations line busy and once you had got through times were either 6pm or after 9pm 4) nightly entertainment was poor more like a good 3 star rather than a 5 star 
camera  i was there the week of july 4th the grounds to the hotel were beautiful and only the a la carte restaurants were tolerable everything else was mediocre at best more importantly they are staffed by thieves , they watch you and wait for the right time to steel , and as mentioned in another review it seems like the security staff is in on it in my case they said it was the guest at the hotel that were the thieves and of course nothing has been done they stole my $500 camera and since the safe in my room did not work my husband hid his wallet at the bottom of one of our very packed up drawers there was $300 dollars in the wallet when we went to the pool , when we returned there was only $ 100 they also did nothing about this i lost every single memory i had of a $5,000 dollar vacation ( mostly of my kids ) i am still not sure what hurt more the camera or the pictures i have no intention of ever going back to punta or anywhere in the dominican republic and the sad thing is that i was born there i did not think i would give this type of review but if you are going here go to the bahia principe or any other high end chain that is not melia 
really dissapointed i stayed in the melia caribe tropica with my family for a ten day vacation and was thoroughly disappointed with the service we received although the resort was really nice and we were impressed with the complementary train service that was provided in the heat , we were faced with a number of different problems firstly , we found that the staff at the hotel could not speak in english , although we tried our level best to speak to them in spanish there was a definite communication problem we also found them to be laid back and unwilling to help secondly , the housekeeping service was very poor we were not provided with clean towels when requested , our rooms were not cleaned properly and we would find large cockroaches wandering around we also had problems with the restaurant reservations , in order to secure reservations we had to wake up as early as 6am and sometime when we arrived at the restaurants we would be told that the reservations could not be found additionally , the food was very salty , being vegetarians we were also limited with our food choices and there was also only a limited choice of wines and beer i found that the bar staff would serve alcoholic drinks to anyone regardless of their age without checking for identification the vacation was supposed to be a treat for my family and i before my daughters left for college , we booked via orbitz and were expecting a good time in a four star hotel , but unfortunately we came back very disappointed 
we had a great family vacation we stayed at the melia from july 11-18 2006 and we were a family of four 2 adults and a six year old and a 3 year old we had a lovely time and the resort is beautiful the resort does have some slight faults but you have to remember that you are in a very poor country and that they depend on tourism for their livelihood some people at the resort were a bit lazy , but most of the employees were wonderful the rooms were very nice and clean , i heard that royal service is phenomenal the food was good , no problems at all the beach and pool were magnificient and we had a great time with the kids at the baby disco every nite , because the kids could not even miss one nite we loved our stay and we had a wonderful time i recommend this hotel for families my kids did use the kids club for a couple of hours and the workers there were phenomenal with my kids and do a very good job we also had a massage at the spa which was very nice the front desk can be very confusing but have some patience and they will help you we loved our vacation 
disgusting flies this will be the most honest review you will ever get there were flies everywhere at the buffets the flies were landing all over the foods the birds were picking at the food this was the most disgusting thing i have ever seen if you want to eat at a restaurant you need to wake up at 7 am in order to make reservations if you happen to be 5 minutes late to the restaurant , especially the japanese , they refuse to serve you your complaints fall on deaf ears the management smile and nod their heads but do nothing i will never book with any melia resort ever again they do not care about their customers 
the good , bad and ugly grounds : are beautiful and well maintained , although a very large complex with cobblestoned roads that are tough on the feet and very slippery when wet beach is very pretty , although the daily battle for umbrella 'd huts which are too few , requires an early wake up call and reserving your spot with a towel or other personal item pools are nice but need some maintenance pool patrons are pretty sloshed by midday and usually best to avoid ( beach has a nicer element ) rooms : decent rooms , not enough towels , once had to wait until 6 pm for clean towels light switches weirdly connected tv without any pay - per movies or video games for kids nor any info about resort or activites no information in rooms about amenities , times of activities , etc food : mediocre at best ridiculous reservation system forcing you to wake at 7 am to call for next day reservations with constant busy signals ( like buying tickets for a concert through ticketmaster just what i want to do on vacation if you happened to get a reservation , not at a time you necessarily want dishes quite unimaginative , typically overly well done , and rehashed from restaurant to restaurant rice and beans at a chinese restaurant my wife and i each had a bellyache at some point service : staff are generally friendly , nice , but most do not speak english and often do not get the job done instead of asking for assistance from a coworker who speaks english , your requests for help result in a smile , a shrug , and ultimately nothing i brought dollar bills to tip the staff but this did not result in better service for the most part on the caribe beach , a waiter carrying drinks for the patrons was frankly rude and made insulting comments in spanish to guests and to me , even after i tipped him what a jerk there is a desparate need for formal instruction on basic service issues for the staffbars : no beach bars a major bummer no waiter service at beach or pool except for the obnoxious guy mentioned above who carried around crappy warm beer and non alcoholic sweet drinks limited alcohol choices and clearly watered down stuff i could swear the absolut and tonic i ordered had some cheap vodka poured into an absolut bottle only one beer , presidente , which makes bud look like heinekin night life : super lame shows with lipsynching entertainers dancing to 20 year old music casino tiny but adequate one disco which caters to tweens and teens between 10 - 12 pm and then they turn the lights up , kick the kids out , and play super loud salsa music from 12-1 am , clearly catering to one group of patrons essentially nothing to do at night except have a mediocre dinner and drink afterwards ps , they 're desserts stink tip : much better to spend $25 for an air conditioned cab ride to and from the airport than deal with the horrible buses and vans that pack you in like sardines , are hot , and make multiple stops at other hotelswould go back to punta cana but not to melia they need a lot of work 
i stayed with my family at the melia tropical in the summer of 2003 it is no wonder that i still remember this horrifying trip , even three years after the fact upon check in , our room was not ready and we had to wait a few hours with nothing to do we decided to go eat something and relax by the pool the melia tropical has no air conditioning it was 90+ degrees , with 100% humidity , i 'm sure when we got to the buffet , there was no lunch left and they were putting everything away we managed to eat what was left in the trays from lunch when we got into our room , the ceiling caved in on us this is not a joke the celing light was leaking water , evidently from the room above us , and in an instant , the light , a veritable waterfall , and bits of ceiling came crashing down on us this is extremely dangerous how water got in the ceiling light escapes/baffles us still we called the front desk and demanded another room after getting the runaround , and a few hours later , they drove us to another room we saw a snake on the pathway , at which point they called a worker who hacked it with a machete another horrible thing about this hotel is it 's walkway and how everything is set up trolleys come to las paradas ( the stops ) every half hour ( the sign says cada 15 minutos every fifteen minutes this is a lie ) the staff is less than helpful , hardly speak english , and are not happy you chose to stay there the next day at the buffet near the pool , i saw a huge waterbug on the floor , walking near my feet i immediately walked out and needed to calm down a bit when i got back to our room that night , i could not sleep and put on the television , which illuminated the room and sent a huge spider and about a dozen little ones scattering across the wall behind the bedboard i put down my hairbrush into the sink after a shower , came back an hour or two later , and saw a trail of ants heading right for it the male hotel staff found it necessary to make catcalls at me while walking around in a bikini that made me extremely nervous and i felt violated at how they would stare do not go into town , because it 's not safe and people will run up to you and bother you for your money the food was horrible , the people were less than friendly , and there were disgusting bugs everywhere they should not have been i realize it is a tropical locale and bugs are expected , but that was just disgusting considering the amount of money we paid in relation to the horrible experience we had please , please , save your money and go somewhere else the upside is that the scenery and beach are absolutely beautiful 
horrendous - never again i have recently been a guest at the melia caribe tropical i ca not believe anyone would rate this a 5 star hotel , i would barely give it a 1 starhotel services : four days prior to our arrival i called the hotel directly and confirmed our reservation - one room , two double beds , close to the ocean and pool ( which we had paid extra for ) we are three adults , one child and a baby they gave us a room with one king size bed we had to wait another day before we got a room with two double beds ( which i must say - these beds are made for very small people but not for grown adults ) trolly car/train : this is an experience that i?? like to forget completely in a place this size they should have a least three trains running at all times the wait for the train averaged 20 minutes and since we were the last stop by the time the train got to us it was completely full and we had to wait yet another 20 minutes or start walking? that would be ok if the lobby was at a reasonable distance walking in 100% humidity in 90 degree weather with a two year old is not the best situation by the time we got to the lobby we were drenched and exhausted restaurants : their system of making reservations is insanely frustrating and completely unacceptable in most of the punta cana resorts you have to make reservations if you want to dine at any of the restaurants , which is understandable unlike the iberostar and bavaro beach where you can make reservations for the whole week the moment you check in , in this resort you have to wake up at 7:00 a and begin dialing the reservation numbers , which are constantly busy , to make a reservation for the next day when i finally got through one day it was 7:20 a and i could no longer get a reservation since they were all booked this became increasingly frustrating in our ??ery long? 11 day stay it took me 5 days before i was able to book a reservation and when we got to the restuarant they did not have us down , even though i called earlier in the day to confirm we were disgusted beyond belief this resort does not have room service so on those nights which we would have loved to have stayed in and not deal with the hassles of the restaurants or that trolley car we had no choice i know resorts , especially ??ll inclusive? resorts , might water down their alcohol this establishment took that concept to a whole new level we ordered a bottle of wine in one of the restaurants and the waiter poured a glass to everyone at the table when i took a sip - it was water? not watered down wine but plain and simple water they were very apologetic but the harm had been done? talk about getting caught cheating the guest pool : it?? great to say that you have 7 pools , but maintaining those pools should be a priority , apparently it 's not to these people there was an unusual odor by the pool bar? can?? describe it or explain it beach : there is no beach service so if you want to drink something you have to walk to the pool bar which would be fine if the bar was close enough - by the time you reached the beach with your drink the ice was melted the iberostar and bavaro beach both have beach service as well as the paradisus which is one of the melia 's hotels ) thank god this was not my first experience in punta cana otherwise i would never be going back luckily i have been a guest at other resorts in punta cana which have been a total pleasure 
punta canwe have service to start off , our family of 6 took this vacation as a business benefit which we receive , once a year , a five star resort vacation this one , by far , has been the biggest letdown when we arrived we were excited but once we walked into our rooms we were a little bit unsure of the quality of the hotel despite that the hotel is only 3 years old it appears to be more like 30 ( no exaggeration ) of the three rooms that we each had two had problems the first room did not have the bathrobes or slippers which were promised , and the toilet seat would not stay up ( very difficult for the men ) the plugs were barely functional in the sinks and bathtubs , there were stains , the ceiling and tiles were cracked and covered in grit the second room needed improvement for starters , having a working light in the shower , a working telephone , and not to mention the missing alarm clock ( not that the ones in the other rooms worked ) , would have been nice moving on to the service the tidiness of the room seemed to dwindle after the first day first everything was done excellent but then they stopped bringing clean towels and restocking the minifridge then it was the cans and garbage being left behind finally the bed was skipped over completely fortunently we had one towel for the two of us to dry off with the food quality was good , but not five star quality ordering a drink could sometimes be a task and even when you placed your order you were not really sure what you were getting we had several great waiters that we tried to find every night , but the remainder left us unsatisfied and disappointed we were excited about in room internet ( even though we had to pay ) but after waiting for two hours after paying for it and no one showed up to fix the problems that we called about several times we gave up from our experience figure out a way around problems , do not bother asking for help ( they do not seem interested in your needs ) the casino was fun , and of course we had two guests who love to gamble , but i am not sure if 25 slots and 4 tables is a casino ( especially when the change the table rules to even more favor the house ) all in all , we absolutely loved the pool ( one of the best ) and the ocean you ca not beat the beautiful white sand , and warm expansive beach line our only suggestion is if you 're looking for a five star service and quality get that at different resort majestic colonial is more like 4 star quality with 3 star service 
almost great my husband and i visited majestic colonial in august '08 for our honeymoon upon arrival we realized we were supposed to have vouchers to get our taxi and to check in my travel agent forgot to give us these , but carlos at the front desk quickly helped us check in we received the room we requested we stayed in the colonial jr suite ocean front room complete with outdoor jacuzzi the room was large , the view amazing , but the lack of bathroom door is a bit awkward after reading the reviews i decided to go on this trip with a very open mind about the food the first night we went to the steakhouse it was good after that , i didn?? eat much lunch was the worst i lost weight going to an all inclusive resort the grounds are truly amazing the island and water are gorgeous the service was also very good however , i will not go back because of the food and that is a shame 
overall a nice place , very clean , staff friendlythe biggest disappointment was they didnt give us rooms near each other we had three rooms , and our teens room was in a different building and not close by was an inconvenience we booked this trip last march or april and i think our rooms should have been together ca not understand why this cant be done if requested would probably go to a different resort next time 
worst vacation ever i just returned from spending a week at the majestic colonial , and it was , hands - down , the worst hotel/resort i have ever stayed in the food was worse than any cafeteria i have ever been to , the drinks were watered down and in tiny cups , and they were blasting cc music factory starting at about 8am until around 11pm of the 7 nights that i stayed there , they only made up my room 4 times , and when i got there on the first day , my room was filthy the noise was the worst part if nothing else this could have been a relaxing trip , but they were blasting music the entire time one of the reasons that my room was never cleaned was because they start the cleaning service at 7:30am , and even if you have the do not disturb sign on the door they still knock the acoustics were such that you could hear someone walking on the ground floor when you were on floor 4 i was unable to get a single night of full sleep i do not think that i could , in any way , recommend staying at the majestic colonial to anyone furthermore , i ca not believe that this place has the high rankings that it does it was awful 
great holiday but hotel needs to sort its food out arrived at the hotel on monday 24th decemeber aprox 4 30pmthe reception area looks nothing like the photo in the brochure or website but it was ok when we checked in the staff new nothing about our booking being linked with our friends and the receptionist told us nothing about the hotel like the other receptionist were telling other guests bell boy took our bags to the bedroom and we followed behind got stuck in the lift next our bedroom and then when we walked into the bedroom the maid was still cleaning the room and the maintance man was in there fixing a light bedrooms : are nice and big , aircon was not always working , toilet was blocked and took 3days for them to finally fix , had to wait 2 days for extra pillows room was not cleaned until 4pm everyday which i think is very late not good at all breakfast was ok but there were only 2 toasters for the whole hotel which is a complete joke lunch and dinner was always cold nice selection but always cold a la carte restaurants were interesting the steak house should not even bother to serve food because it 's awful cold , staff ignored you the chinese and french were very good swimming pools : brilliant entertainment team : worked there socks off fantastictrips : tropical storm is brilliant day out on a boat and saonau island is beautiful both worth every penny after going to mexico last year the standard is just not the same beautiful weather though very poor country and the airport is something else would not go back but only because there are too many places in the world to go back to the same place 
would not recomended it to anyone there were a lot of mix ups from the beginning rooms were mixed up and people were not in the system the majority of our good had to change rooms or make up grades some of us did not bother or want the hassle my room - walls were dirty , faucets falling apart , tub plug did not work , shower door would not close beds were hard and i could change the tempurature of the air conditioning i found that for your rooms to be cleaned it did not matter the amount of tip you left the service was all the same i think they might have mopped our floors twice also some of our groups rooms were not cleaned by 5:00pm the food was average but be choosy on where you go we went to the japanese with reservations and i found it very salty which was odd because everyother place we ate lacked the french restaurant was good was well as the carribian/domincan which is located right beside the french my favourite part was the pool and the beach this was my first all inclusive so i should have ahd lower expectation but with reading all the reviews that claimed this place was so fantastic i was really dissapointed i wish that i had taken pictures of the rooms to give and idea 
found the majestic colonial below average my husband and i just returned from a week stay at the majestic colonial the staff were great maria , fransisco and wander were on top of things the resort is a bit tired and in need of some up grades we immediately asked for a room change as we were right by the theatre and disco the room we were given was very quiet but again in need of paint and new bedding , the beds are very hard and old the food was very , very average got pretty boring after day 3 same spread every day the grounds , however , are beautiful and well groomed we have been to many all - inclusives so have a good idea of what 5 star would be and this a 3 hope this helps 
a nice experience beach party at night we had a lot of fun 
never going back okay , my husband and i went down there for a wedding just got back yesterday arrived at the resort only to find that half our groug ( about 25 people ) didn`t have rooms ready at 3:00 pm didn`t seem like a huge issue at first we were told it would be about an hour and we all went to get a drink those included who did not have a room ready were the bride and groom , the brides parents , my husband and i and many others went back an hour later , luckily our room was ready however almost everyone elses was not found out that the resort had double booked many rooms and one couple from our group actually got moved to another resort they did however get bands so they could come and go into majestic colonial bride and groom didn`t get a room until around 9 and staff refused to give them towel cards so they could go swiming buffet was okay large selection , some food was cold when it should have been hot covers on food might have helped keep the heat in le gourmet was the only meal we really enjoyed almost immediately half our group was sick violently throwing up , fevers , and chest problems mother of the groom was rushed to the hospital but returned next day there is a clinic on site but its $90 00 to basically walk through the door and then if you need anything another arm and leg father of the bride also became very ill staying in his room a great deal of the time bar was okay not a huge selection for liquor ( premium ) and if you wanted what they did have you had to pay ( bailey`s ect ) when we went to sandals jamaica ocho rios all liquor was included even things like covasia and grand marnier if you ordered a slushy like drink , ie pina colada or daquiri`s you had better as for alcohol otherwise you aren`t getting it on the other side , my rum and coke had way more run then coke beach was really nice , water was worm clothing on the beach was optional so there were a lot of breasts and banana hammocks bride and groom got sick on last day thankfully not the wedding and and when we got back home had to go to the doctors mother of the brides luggage did not make it to the airport even though the bus driver assured us it went on the bus dont know how they can assure us of that when it wasnt there had to pay themselves to have the luggage come by taxi and yes , they did get a receipt i would be asking the hotel for the money overall we still had a good time as we were with our friends for a wedding but i would never go back there 
caution - when push comes to shove although the hotel may be beautiful , my 82 year old mother in law broke her hip and thigh on the floors slippery from condensation , which also made her sheets wet constantly we were threatened by hotel management that we had to sign a release , or the hotel would not pay for any help for us although dominican surgeon said she could not fly sitting up , all the hotel did was book one seat on a commercial airliner , in which she had to fly sitting up the doctor called from puerto rico to accompany her to nyc was not called for over 24 hours after promised , and the doctor was livid at what was done to her , for which he said hotel was accountable take plenty of extra insurance when you book , because this hotel will threaten you and leave you hanging if something should happen 
great ai but advise from a very sick guest i agree with most of the reviews about the hotel but here is some advise i wish that someone had posted when i had read the reviews how to avoid becoming ill if i can prevent you from getting ill , as we did , then at least all will not be lost we travelled oct i guess that we (4 of us ) should have become worried when the bus announcer told us about 20+ times not to brush our teeth with the tap water he assured us that all produce etc was washed in purified water and water at eating areas was also purified take your chances on that on our second day , despite all precations , my friends and i all became became violently ill in fact , we all passed out either onto the hard marble floors or onto the cement around the pool hiting our heads and receiving large bumps major amounts of gravol to get home and we were sick for at least 5 days after returning so our 7 day vacation turned into at least a 2 day vacation and 5 days of sickness , plus 3 days work loss doing research upon returning home , we found out the following : do not eat eat any produce or vegetables that do/did not have a peel do not eat anything from the sea do not drink any water , except bottled water , even at buffets only choose dishes that are bubbling hot or cooked in front of you majestic has a cooked vegetarian section , try it do not eat at the beach buffet where food is more often recycledthis is a 5* hotel that is only 2 years old many people we talked to , since we looked so ill , also told us that they felt ill too shame on this hotel for not providing the purified water for all patrons a purification system would be inexpensive in the long run as we wo not be back to the dr despite the fact that the majestic is otherwise a very nice place to vacation hope this helps sounds limiting but you take your chances i took gravol , imodium etc and nothing worked we are all social drinkers and not heavy sunbathers , so we know it was the food/water be careful of young and elderly , please , because we were very , very ill 
do not believe the hype we went for my brother in law 's wedding last august there 's a big hype with this hotel unfortunately , it did not live up to the hype this trip was our first in the caribbean it was a very disappointing experience we had so many problems that i do not even know where to start they gave a room with the garden view , ( i forgot the room number ) but it was located in the ground floor the backdoor latch wont close , a friend of ours told us that the lock in their backdoor is broken got curious and checked ours and alas our lock was broken too make matters worst , we had to call maintenance for our key to work 5-8 times they said it was the battery , or the way we open the door well how many ways can you really enter the card the wrong way on our 3rd night , i woke up to go to the bathroom , and believe it or not the bathroom door came off it was a solid glass door this was at 2am it took me a while to put down the door co 'z it was soooooooo heavy called maintenance to come and fix it and of course no answer and was told it will be fix in the morning imagine , we did not have a door to cover us up when we go to the washroom they did not come till the afternoon to fix the door we thought that was it the worst was yet to come our last night we found a cockroach by our closet it was a big one and i am terrified with insects , so imagine me yelling and screaming other than that , the food was ok except for the disgusting stuff they serve at the chinese restaurant they need a new chef the view was great and the pool was awesome 
mixed the folks who work there were awesome at every level keyla , hilario , angel , and carlos at the front desk were so friendly and helpful the pool is great , too the food here was unspeakably awful so bad that i kept eating just to see how they could one - up themselves in terms of horrible fare stay as far away from the seafood restaurant as humanly possible you have been warned the various buffets are lame everything tastes the same , which is to say a combination of bland and gross i do not know what they do to it , but i am certain that they either do not taste the food or could care less what it tastes like this is very disconcerting when the main draw of all - inclusive ( for me ) is the food the property itself was ok the rooms were very nice however , beyond a very small street of overpriced stores and the outdoor entertainment center ( easily the worst michael jackson ever again , we stayed just to see how bad it could get , and it did ) , there really is not much else the tennis courts are surrounded by construction , the casino is super - tiny , and the dance club was average if you want someplace to stay where you are close to the beach and just want to chill by the pool all day , then this place is fine for an overall experience i would not get my hopes up 
my experience at majestic colonial , from new jersey we stayed at majestic colonial in punta cana , dominican republic when we arrived they had majestic drinks waiting for us and it was so refreshing because it was really hot i was a little bit disappointed because talking to other guests they got cold wet towels along with their drinks but i did not they need to be more consistent with all their guests the room was very elegant but i did not like the bathroom it was open and we had a child so there was no privacy so if you are travelling with children make sure you book a room that has bathroom doors if you have children you might have to bring your own wash cloths too because none was provided in the room and it took 6 hours before i got them they have seven restaurants , huge pool , activities and lots more for you to do so you will never be bored be careful with your excursions , we went parasailing and paid $85 for two people and it lasted less than 10minutes i was very upset because in the activity book it is listed for 1 hour the drinks was very good and i took advantage of it to get my money 's worth because i was not crazy about the food do not get me wrong they have seven restaurants one can choose from the staff were very friendy but one night at the seafood restaurant one of the servers made me so mad because he would not listen to what we wanted to order for our drinks and then the other server spilled water all over the table i was very upset i must say one employee that really stand out to me the most was nina , she works on the animation team she was always smiling and saying hello and adopted us as her family , she is a wonderful girl , go nina and keep up the good work and i hope to see you sometime again in the future overall i had a great time and would recommend my friends and family to go there on their next vacation and of course majestic colonial , punta cana would see me again in the future reineen from new jersey 
nothing to brag about we stayed at the majestic from august 18th - august 26th and could not wait to return home there is no doubt that the resort is beautiful in appearance , and after staying in punta cana last summer this resort had a lot to live up to in order to compete w/the paradisus palma real there is no doubt in my mind that paradisus blows this place out of the water i am just going to state the facts :1 there were too many uncontrollable children on the resort w/nothing to do they were jumping from the overhead bridges into the pool , cartwheeling into the pool , and even leaping into the pool from the ledge of the whirlpool the resort honestly needs to invest in a children 's program and/or activities for children i did notice that there is a castle being built , which looks like it is in the works for the children maybe that will improve this issue on 2 separate dates we saw feces floating in the pool when i went to tell the staff of our discovery and suggest removal no one knew english the pool just became less  less clear day by day i can honestly say i never saw anyone cleaning it or even skimming for debris at the bottom well , we saw a roach or 2 wiggle its ' way in the room from under our doorway we definitely killed the few we saw , but who knows what got past our eyes thus , it got to the point where i was stuffing a towel under the door in an attempt to keep them out i even aired out our luggage on the balcony just to make sure we would not have any company when we got home thank god we have no surprises at home thus far customer service was just inconsistent you either found someone that was extremely helpful or someone who acted like you did not exist there were days where we were not offered a drink at all while at the buffet or lack there of the liquor in drinks must of been non existent and it definitely was not premium liquors the only liquor that seemed to cause any buzz was mama juana of course  the house rum , brugal other than that you were begging for a buzz i must say the specialty drink the majestic was quite tasty please let me give credit where credit is due barone in the steak house is excellent and anne marie rauch is very helpful as well i just feel that this resort has many quirks to work out as far as customer service , cleanliness , and general resort operations i can honestly say we will not be back 
this was our first time in punta cana and unfortunately the last the quality of the food was not that of a 5 star resort , customer service was not an option and the cleanliness was less than impeccable for a 3 year old resort the beach was beautiful but you can get that in other islands luckily i was there for a reason , my best friend 's wedding 
managing your expectations is the key to good vacation at the majestic my husband , our 10 year old daughter and i stayed at the majestic colonial august 16-23 we had a really relaxing vacation and i would recommend the hotel with a few caveats first i would like to thank anne marie in guest services as i had emailed her in advance asking for a room in building 2 when we arrived we had a lovely room overlooking the pool on the ground floor across from the spa it was a perfect location and we enjoyed the ability to go out our sliding doors and jump into the pool as most everyone has said the grounds , pool and beach are all very nice there is no shortage of loungers or palapas for shade i would even venture to say that there were too many loungers on the beach as for the musty smell in the rooms people have complained of i would say it?? about the same as what you would find in most humid , tropical climates i was at the ritz carlton in key biscayne florida the week prior and it suffers from the same problem i do think the hotel should do a little better job on upkeep and maintenance ? painting , replacing grout etc we found the staff to all be very friendly and helpful with one exception the bartender at the swim up bar ? maximo had a serious attitude problem and as much as we tried to avoid him it was close to impossible as he was usually working there the woman bartender was lovely we found the front desk staff very friendly ? especially sofia who checked us in one of the reasons we chose the majestic was that it was billed as family friendly and advertised 2 kids club ? one for 3-7 year olds and one for 8-14 year olds the facilities at the kids? club are very obviously for little kids and were not in the greatest state of repair there were no separate activities that we could find for older kids and every time we went by there were only little kids we spoke to several families with older kids and they were all disappointed in this all of the animation that takes place at the pool and beach is adult oriented ? it wouldn?? take much to have one or two activities a day designed to get older kids to meet each other at the pool and help make friends the pool is also large enough that it could be done without taking away anything from the adults we??e done club med and other ai resorts and i think the majestic could do a much better job on this with very little effort it?? important to us for our daughter to make friends and have fun so this would be a serious consideration about whether to return here while i was not expecting to be wowed by the food by day 7 it was becoming very tiresome breakfast was fine but lunches and dinners became extremely monotonous ? overcooked meat and fish , lots of casserole type things sitting in sauces plus the usual burgers etc we did have a pretty good meal at le gourmet for lunches i ended up eating salads and taking fresh cut veggies etc from the made to order pasta station and cobbling together a somewhat crunchy , healthful salad made to order pasta was a good choice as you knew it wasn?? sitting there for ages we did really enjoy stopping by the lobby bar every evening for a drink before dinner the property is especially beautiful at night we only made it to one show as they start at 10pm and a day filled with sun , swim and rum cocktails sends us to bed somewhat early the show we saw was the circus and it far exceeded my expectations it is a sort of mini cirque du soleil and was extremely professional and entertaining after watching the friday ms bikini contest my only comment is that apparently lap dancing 101 must be part of the curriculum in most us and european high schools it was an interesting sight to watch parents egg on their 18 year old daughters to shimmy away for the audience of leering men i?? no prude but yikes people i think it?? all about managing your expectations this is a solid 3 star hotel it?? not a place i would ever choose to get married or honeymoon but that?? just me it?? a good place to come with extended family ( we saw lots of large family groups ) , lots of young couples and singles and really , for the price , it?? a great getaway 
we stayed there from aug 17 to 24th flight : excellent - flew with air canada and the flights were prefectarrival , departure and transportation to and from resort : excellent - took us less than 1 ? from the time we arrived until we checked into our room it was prefect departure was prefect as well one of the best we have ever been to pool : good - large but not inspiring facilities : good ? well maintainedfood : good ? breakfast selection is amazing but everything else is average staff : average - hardworking but not friendly room : poor - specious but poorly decorated sink was leaking , closet handles broken and furnishing is wobbly the opening between the room and the bathroom is not a good idea when you have kids 
sadly disappointed our family just returned from a week at the majestic colonial and sadly we were disappointed it was our first time to punta cana we have travelled to mexico many times , but thought we would give the dominican a try the beach and the weather we had was the best we have ever had on any holiday we have travelled the beach was really the only thing that made our trip an enjoyable one we had booked a garden view room , but was given a room that faced the construction of the new addition to the resort i had complained to the front desk , but they told me there was no other rooms available the staff was friendly , but there was very limited staff at the pool bars or the outdoor bars , you would need to wait at least 10 minutes before you were served half the time we just gave up waiting and the alcoholic drinks were poorly made the tropical drinks were spoiled with too much alcohol in them we ended up just drinking bottled water the soft drinks were not any better , they were very warm with ice cubes put in them the food was another big disappointment we ate at the buffet mostly because we had our 2 boys with us the food was bland , not much variety - same food every day the pool was nice but we spent most of our time at the beach the beach is gorgeous most beautiful beach we have seen we 'll let 's just say there isnt one thank goodness our boys were content playing pool , or chess in the sports area if it did rain i wouldnt know what we would have done to keep us entertained i would not recommend this resort to my friends or family because it was our first time to punta cana i can not compare it to another resort but we will definately travel back to mexico before to travel to punta cana again 
beautiful resort , but my family and i (6 adults , 8 kids/teens ) just returned from our stay at the majestic , and i wanted to share our experience we have stayed at many all - inclusive resorts over the years , and have been to punta cana before as well ( my husband and i stayed at excellence last march , and absolutely loved it ) although we genuinely enjoyed our vacation at the majestic , there were several problems that fellow travelers need to be aware of , and that management at the resort really needs to address first , here?? what we liked : check - in was fast and easy , and our interaction with madeleine at guest services was a pleasure the beach , pool and resort grounds are all very beautiful and seem to be well maintained everything you??e heard about the beach is true - it is absolutely spectacular , and the water is amazing plus , there are always plenty of lounge chairs and shade both at the pool and the beach the animation team is friendly and fun , and there are plenty of enjoyable activities to keep all ages happy our rooms were cleaned every day , and contained several nice amenities ( e hair dryer , iron , dvd player , jacuzzi , etc the entertainment was enjoyable ( especially the circus show ) , the sports bar and casino were both lots of fun , and the staff was generally very nice all in all , we had a good time on the down side , the food isn?? very good , nor very plentiful you certainly won?? starve , but the portions ( in the sit - down ) restaurants are small , and it is difficult to get a second helping this is the only all - inclusive that we??e stayed at where staff refused to bring what we ordered in fact , at most other resorts , the staff is eager to please you , and will usually bring you anything you?? like at the majestic , however , this doesn?? seem to be the case on our first night at the resort , we went to the seafood restaurant and my husband ordered the grouper the portion was small and the fish was bland , so after he finished his dinner , he asked for the lobster ( my daughter had ordered it , and liked it ) he was told no when we protested , the waiter relented , but then never brought out the dinner we finally gave up , and walked up to the main buffet this happened again the following evening at the ala cart asian restaurant when we each ordered two appetizers other people at the resort reported the same thing happening to them , so it definitely wasn?? an isolated instance ( by the way , just so you know , both my husband and my children are all quite thin , and were not really looking to gorge themselves ) also , there are generally no snack foods available during the late afternoon in other resorts , snacks such as chips and salsa , chicken wings , grilled foods , etc are available all day by the beach however , much to the disappointment of my children , this was not the case at the majestic one last comment regarding the food - the mixed drinks ( including the ??rozen? are not very cold , are usually watered down , and most have a funny after - taste as a result , we generally stuck to sodas and bottled water , but even they weren?? very cold either also , while the staff is usually pretty nice , the service ( in the restaurants , not the bars ) is quite slow - especially for drink/water orders another issue was that our keys stopped working numerous times during the week my husband , children and i stayed in two adjacent rooms on the second floor of building 2 ( a very nice location facing the beach ) between us , we had 4 keys - 2 for each room over the course of our vacation , each of us had to replace our keys many times while this wasn?? exactly the end of the world , it was extremely frustrating and inconvenient - mostly because the main lobby/front desk was a good 10 minute walk away imagine trudging all the way up to your room to use the ??acilities , ? only to learn that your key doesn?? work talk about uncomfortable situations anyway , that brings me to a problem that seems to be common in the dr : out of the 14 people in our party , more than half had tummy troubles - including my two children ( mercifully , my husband and i were spared ) was that because of the food , the water , the heat i have no idea , but i suggest that anyone visiting the majestic ( or anywhere in the dr ) pack a large supply of immodium another observation i?? like to share is that the resort seems to have been built in a hurry ( i think this was mentioned by other reviewers as well ) although all our concerns ( broken toilet seat , bad outlet , broken safe , etc ) were attended to quickly , a resort this new probably shouldn?? have so many issues we heard the same complaints from several other travelers at the resort , so again , this was not an isolated instance one other indication that the resort may have been built quickly/poorly is that we had 4 blackouts during our week 's stay two lasted 30 plus minutes , and two were brief - all were annoying each time a blackout occurred , the thermostat in our room had to be reset , and the air - conditioning had to be turned on again since none of the blackouts seemed to affect the resort adjacent to the majestic , the cause was probably internal if you do decide to go to the majestic , i strongly suggest that you bring a flashlight or two it is very dark around the resort grounds , especially during a blackout finally , our last complaint was ( as far as we know ) an isolated issue : on the second night of our stay , we discovered an island ??oach? the size of a mouse in our room seriously , i?? not kidding - it was huge sadly , that was not the end of it although guest services quickly fumigated our room , we also discovered several regular - sized roaches throughout the remainder of the week as you can imagine , this put a major damper on our stay now , i realize that the majestic is in a tropical location , and i also completely understand that bugs ( ants , mosquitos , flies , etc ) are part of the deal in the carribean but , i draw the line at roaches i should mention , however , that none of the other members in our group had this problem ( including our two children in the room next door to us ) , so maybe roaches are not really a big problem at the resort maybe we were just unlucky unfortunately , this one issue will probably prevent me from returning to the majestic anytime soon 
great resort very mediocre food arrival at puj was one of the fastest arrive and out of the airport experiances i have ever had leaving however was a nightmare of waiting in long lines in very hot and humid weather our travel agent arranged round trip transfers , if you have 3 people or more in your group in is a far better option to take a taxi , about $45, less money and you wo not have to visit numerous other hotel properties on the way to and from yoursyours , plus you wo not have to leave 4 hours or so ahead of departure time the majestic property is large , well maintained and an exceptional value it is important to remember that you are visiting a third world country to put this in perspective the people that look after you on property earn room , board and about $200 per month so they welcome and encourage you to tip them on occasion this will get you better service , but for the most part it wo not i tried overtipping as well , it did not work in their defense they hustle continuously and put out great effort , i just felt that they were overwhelmed the majority of the tome to echo everyone else on here the beach and pool are great with plenty of seating and shade available however the service for drinks at both is sporadic at best the rooms were fine , maid service was never consistent and they even missed on day untill we called them we never saw a bug in our room they knew better the food was by far the most dissapointiong aspect of the entire trip except for the breakfast buffet which was as good as you can get in far superior resorts the rest was to put it bluntly rubbish i nferior quality and for the most part was precooked which accounts for most guests complaint with the lack of flovor or the toughness one evening we went off property to  jelltfish  , a great exdperience and i strongly recommend it to anyone travelling to the area the power outages were annoying at best and ould have made impact no on our opinion of the resort our kids ages 18, 22 and 23 enjoyed the trip but we have both decided that we would not return 
they could do better having read the reviews before my trip , i feel it is my duty to write this review through my eyes i will start with my arrival upon arrival , we were greeted by the staff and given our room keys we were tired and hungry because our flight had a four hour delay so we get our keys walk to our room , which is about 10 minutes away from the lobby and the key does not work , so we had to walk back to the lobby to get a new key because the maid would not let us in our room that was so frustrating the animation team is the best , they get everyone involved if you have the opportunity to meet maria , she is the sweetest woman restaurants - the main dining hall is great ( great selection ) , the french restaurant is good , the seafood restaurant is the best and the japanses restaurant is good stay away from the mexican food and lunch time by the beach , too many flies , the flies go away at night because the food is not out in the open staff - for some reason , we never could get wash clothes and the maids dont clean your room , in my eyes they only make your bed i used their shampoo and shower gel every day and the maid would leave the empty bottles in the showever everyday we had to ask for wash clothes every day and we left $4 per day in the room ( tip ) and still she never could give us wash clothes , i had to go look for her every day my mother made coffee every morning in the room and the maid would always forget to put more cream or sugar , it never failed i think the staff at the majestic just does not care the manager in the chinese food restaurant , he was rude i told him the soda was flat and he did not believe me , he was not nice the only time you can get good service is when the big boss 's are around you will notice who the boss is one night we ate at the japanese restaurant and i had to ask for soda four times the best waiter was danny by the beach danny made sure that my glass was never empty again , the hotel grounds are clean and the food is good , however the service they provide needs improvement the treadmill in the gym is broken and we were told the boss does not want to fix it they show a movie every night , all of the movies skip on the dvd they are old , you mean to tell me the majestic can not afford a new treadmill and dvd 's do not buy anything at the thursday flea market , go outside to punta blanka its to the right of the resort , it takes you five minutes , you can get a better deal make sure you never pay the price that is quoted , you can get at least 90% off the majestic is beautiful because of its pool and beach , you probably can find the same at another hotel there are a lot of children at the majestic , parents just leave their children to roam the resort , so you see the children , getting into everything i probably would not stay there again , the service is poor 
nice place but needs improvements not child safe let start off by saying i am far from a picky person give me some decent food and an amazing beach and i am a happy camper im not critical at all and dont freak out of the little things bc not for nothing it is dr the beach hands down is the most beautiful i have ever been clear , warm , beautiful sand , a section to snorkel i just loved it you can walk and walk its a beautiful beach very nice pool in concept not well maintained if you have kids that run around the pool there are many pot holes where they can trip and hurt themselves badly its best to make they wear water shoes the pavment is very uneven and is a hazard to kids some of the filters in the pool are not covered or are loose the jet pool area dosent work on one side please dont waste your time with the beach restaurant i can eat pizza and wendy 's when need be but this place is gross it takes forever to get a drink  is infested with flies do yourself a favor dry up and go to the main dining hall for lunch but seriously dry up bc they put a chair outside and make you sit to see if you have a wet bathing suit there were a few idiots who obviously couldnt read the sign in english that said no wet bathingsuits dont waste your time with the japanese restaurant they make is sound to important/elite that they tell you that its booked for days at a time we got a reservation for 930pm and the food was so average nothing worth waiting for they ran out of sushi how does that happen the hibachi was so average ok but dont work around the reservation they say men have to wear pants i saw plenty of men in shorts and flip flops go to the frence or mexican restaurant i didnt think any of the food was exceptional i thought it was pretty ok nothing i will strongly remember this place is at best 3 - 31/2 stars def not 4 the drinks are very watered down hard to get a frozen drink when i was in mexico in the beginning of the month there were plenty so it has nothing to do with the heat try the outside bar they make the best drinks the one by the gazebo the people are very vey nice and very warm thats why i love this country of course you do find a few who are lazy with attitudes but thats 1 out of 5 if you have a problem with your room do not go to the front desk they could care less go to client services by the internet cafe they are very very nice and want to help to the best of their ability also the front desk manager is very nice and very professional their management staff is wonderful i cant give say one bad thing bc we had one of the nicest rooms in the hotel but the average rooms are great in concept for a adult only resort but this is not child friendly the only place you can change is in the shower there is nothing that closes off the room to change no privacy when you use the bathroom whatever you do on the toilet everyone hears in the room its very stupid if you have teenagers better get them their own room i saw so many kids waiting outside the door while parents changed the concept is idiotic for a family resort all the rooms are like that lol its so stupid great for a honeymoon or couples the main issue this place was rushed to be put together without a dought there are glass units that fall on the floor yes a tiled floor room service dosent know how to clean i found quite a few large peices of glass on the floor i took they to client services and said explain to me why this is on the floor with all the small children running around this place and i dont have kids but can sympathize our toilet seat was broke we had three black outs at night takes 30-45 minutes to get it back and hardly any emergency lights 
nice resorts , but problems my husband and i stayed at the majestic colonial july 6, 2008 to july 13, 2008 aesthetically , the resort is gorgeous , but it does have some problems room : we booked the majestic colonial suite room the room itself was one of the nicest rooms we have stayed in we were in room 2117, which is on the first floor there was a bottle of champagne and a plate of fruit in the room for us when we arrived there is a jacuzzi in the room and on the balcony you have direct access to the pool with your own cushioned lounge chairs so you do not have worry about finding a spot around the pool you also have a little lawn in the back leading to the pool , and there are bushes separating the lawns , so you do have some privacy some of the reviews i have read said the bed was uncomfortable the bed in our room had a pillow top mattress cover not sure if that was because we had the upgraded room or not if you book the upgraded room , you get a breakfast delivered to the room on a morning of your choice it is not a full fledged breakfast they bring , coffee , oj , another bottle of champgne , fruit , muffins we went to the buffet afterwards room serivce is also free with the upgraded room only problem is that there really is not much to choose from and the food is not that good the a/c did work well pool : the pool its very large and the temperature was always warm , some days a little too warm it is about 4 feet deep throughout there is a swim up bar over by the activites portion of the pool room service : the maid did not come clean the room on her own the first 3 days we had to call housekeeping more than once each time to have the room cleaned and to get clean towels as the other reviews have mentioned , there were no washcloths the mini bar in the rooms are supposed to be re - stocked daily this also did not happen again we had to call multiple times my husband went to the concierge after the third day in a row of problems after complaining , the room was cleaned and the mini bar was stocked daily internet : there is an internet room upstairs in the lobby they charge $5 for 30 minutes restaurants : for breakfast , the indoor buffet is pretty good they have a large variety of choices and a couple of cooking stations for made to order eggs you can also go to the open air restaurant by the beach for breakfast they have a smaller selection , also buffet the food for lunch at the indoor buffet is very repetitive the same foods were offered every day oh , and if you are wearing a bathing suit that even looks wet , they wo not let you in you will have to eat at the open air restaurant at the lunch buffet the pasta station at both places is pretty good the french restaurant is by far the best restaurant at the resort we ate there twice during our stay the french restaurant requires a reservation and guys must wear long pants , and shoes the steakhouse and the seafood restaurant are the same restaurant even though they list it as two seperate restaurants they just ask you if you want the steak or seafood menu it is at the open air restaurant which also serves breakfast and lunch we did not eat from the seafood menu , but the steakhouse food was pretty good the mexican/ dominican restaurant was hit and miss two nights it was good and another night it was pretty gross they do have a large salad bar/ buffet for appetizers we did not go to the hibachi ( requires reservation ) part of the asian restaurant , but we did eat at the a la carte part of the restaurant and it was terrible i got sick from eating the food for anyone who has food allergies , be very careful of the food at the buffets many of the foods at the buffet are not labeled so if you have any severe food allergies , do not eat anything unless you know exactly what it is and what is in it they also use the same tongs to cook seafood and other meats so beware of cross contamination my husband is very allergic to seafood we went to the buffet for dinner one night and he ate something that must have touched seafood and got really sick drinks : we could never get a cold drink anywhere the frozen drinks were never frozen , just slightly icy even though they are in a machine the soft drinks were always super warm i think the problem was that the dispenser did not keep the drinks refridgerated they stored them at room temperature and just put ice in the drinks which never got cold beach : the beach was nice there were plenty of palapas , and we never had issues finding a chair there is a big drop on the beach as you approach the water and the depth of the water drops a lot a few yards in the water was very clear and refreshing though nightlife : the entertainment at the resort is pretty bad the shows are corny the michael jackson show is funny for a quick minute but after that minute you are ready to leave they had a magician one night who was so bad people were just sitting there trying to figure out if he was performing a trick or just walking around we gave up going to the shows after that they have a beach party one night with a band , but that too is poorly organized the casino is small they have one roulette , black jack , and poker table , though the poker table was never open the slots were ok , you can actually hit for a couple bucks on them every night in front of the lobby bar they have a table set up serving nachos , and other snacks one night they had a smoothie hut set up - this was the only semi - frozen drink i had the entire stay overall , we had an okay vacation we travel to the caribbean at least once a year and have been to dominican 3 times now : sun village resort in puerto plata 
service needs alot of improvement after arriving at the resort , i expected a welcome with some cool drinks at the check in at the time of checking in , i had to ask the register if i can have a bottle of water and was told to go to the bar got in the room with no issue the place is immaculate the pool is so clean and different than other pools in the other resorts a serpentine shape the beach is so clean and well managed seat lounges are available through out the beach area tommy filler : food are just average the same thing everyday unless you go to different restaurants in the resort entertainments : nightly shows just ok for the kids casino is too small disco is as small as my basement services : this really needs alot of improvement a couple of times the room maid took our used towels with out replacements it took me 3 hour and 3 phone calls at the register before i got some towels also you do not get face towels if you do not ask for it the mini bar i should say it 's good , it 's always replenished daily bar : you only get domestic drinks when you ask for imports , these are extra i was charge $6 for grey goose and raspberry drink imported beer is extra as well no tequila shots at the bar all in all , the stay is just ok but the service really needs improvement 
majestic colonial is not really majestic where can i possibly begin the grounds are kept beautifully the rooms however , are not maintained clean you have to do lots of walking to get from point 'a 'to point 'b ' there is a big span in time where there is absolutley nothing to do the people who entertain are friendly there was a bartendar named ernesto ( tiburon ) who was very kind , cordial and made sure my glass was always filled the selection of drinks is minimal you have to pay if you want any of the good liquor for it is not even included in the v package , which is what i had in the evenings , the theater is so hot that it is virtually impossible to sit and watch the whole performance the disco caters to the very young and the music is repetitive there was one evening when i wanted to purchase a card to use the internet ( you have to pay ) and two of the workers literaly argued with each other as to who would get the card for me to the point where i just said forget it and left they were very rude and unattentive the food overall is good , lots to choose from except for another evening when the waiter was very rude ( in the seafood restaurant ) he became annoyed when one of the people in our party of 13 asked for a double order of lobster he bought half a lobster instead of the whole lobster that the other patrons in the restaurant received , and then he made us wait over 45 minutes to get coffee needless to say , we felt uncomfortable and very ill at ease the prize for those who participate in any of the activities is always a bottle of liquor ( brugal , ugggg ) they should alternate and also give out tee - shirts i do not think that the majestic colonial in punta cana will be seeing me or the people that i traveled with again , and unfortunetly , when asked , i will not have many good things to say about this particular resort i actually feel that this year , i wasted my money and did not enjoy my vacation 
the majestic has very nice grounds it was always kept clean we stayed in jr suites which were also very nice and clean the beds and pillows were hard , but after a long day in the sun we fell asleep pretty quick the staff was always friendly the restaurants were very clean and attractive the food for the most part was good everything seems to be second rate , compared to the american quality food the drinks were the same story the mixers were unknown and tasted bad the vodka seemed to be the best alcohol choice there was no coke product , although they offered what they had as such the bottled water was good they have a construction project going on next to the majestic , an expansion i believe if you do not want to be awoken early in the a by hammers , drills , etc do not get rooms facing this construction 
was not thrilled with the resort i , along with 8 other family members stayed at the majestic for 7 days the resort grounds were nice the pool was beautiful we were only allowed one beach towel per person the beach was ok , a little rocky and we were misled that it was the caribbean waters , it is not the room was big , but there was no privacy in the bathroom every day we had to ask for more towels the breakfast at the buffet was good , but for the rest of the meals , it was just ok the dominican/mexico and lobster/steak restaurants were very good we had a 16th birthday party at the dominican/mexican restaurant and they went above and beyond it was simply fantastic i was not impressed with the night life at the resort me and seven members of my family went on the extreme ranch atvs , and the experience was horrible the atvs were very old and dangerous i personally had to change vehicles three times along the route the first vehicle had no breaks the second one died along the route and the third one i choked all the way from the fumes i believe the vendors who have space at the resort should stay on top of these excursions the activities on the beach every day was very nice and i enjoyed them i feel some of the staff at the resort were pleasant this was my first time at this resort and at punta cana , and i have no intention of returning 
mixed bag at majestic we stayed at the majestic for 10 days late june into july we 'd had the trip booked since nov '07 to celebrate our anniversary and our first kidless vacation in 19 years the resort was pretty busy , so i?? guess they were at full capacity disclaimer : i?? a bit of a germ - a - phobe , as i have been sick on vacation before arrivalyou will have to pay for a ten dollar ??raveler?? pass? you pay for the pass , are handed the pass , then you give it right back to them it?? a little weird if you get carsick easily , take some dramamine before you get on the bus to the resort check in went smoothly but i was on guard the minute we arrived as i 'd been reading the trip advisories we had paid for an ocean front room and out of the gate , the front desk girl tried to deny this we 'd even had our travel agent confirm the week before alas , when i put my foot down and showed the paper work from our agent , she called over another girl who said the first girl had made a mistake , and of course we had an ocean front room we were escorted to our room by a porter who spoke no english , but he still could communicate what we needed to know with gestures and pointing to signs he was very pleasant our room was oceanfront in name only the view obstructed by the grass diving hut , and the other ocean front balconies that jutted out further than ours this was the third floor on the farthest side of the resort , overlooking the neighboring resort rooms at the ocean front end of the resort are subject to a terrible echo factor that reverberates through the doors to your room , which have huge gaps around them staff and guests were very noisy in the hallways , and we could hear any and everything that happened in the alcove of the ocean front hallways it is also quite a hike from oceanfront to the lobby the bathroom set up provides little privacy??f you don?? know your roommate intimately , you will by the end of your vacation : o ) the shower was great??wo heads and lots of room the patio jacuzzi took forever to fill , and it wouldn?? hold the water with a leaky drain i was very uncomfortable in our room from the get go the ac was hard wired to a supposed 20 degrees celsius i do not think it got any cooler than 78 degrees in our room i could not use the bathroom mirror to get ready , as it was so hot in that area under the lights and eons away from the ac vent ( we had a junior colonial suite ) when we complained about it , we were told that the thermostats were set to go no cooler than 20, and there was not anything they could do about it therefore , it was truly disheartening to learn from another guest that his room was too cool , and his thermostat went down to 5 degrees celsius on the day before we left , we learned our neighbors had no ac at all in their room , and victor became involved they actually had to change ( very noisily ) the whole ac unit which affected more than just our neighbor?? room no wonder our room never felt cool enough and funny , after we told victor that we 'd been suffering in a too warm room , somehow our thermostat ??hat couldn?? be turned down? miraculously was reprogrammed down to 18 degrees c on our last night but it still was not any cooler the ventilation system there also needs a good cleaning of course there will be a mildew smell??t?? one of the most humid places on earth??ut an occasional cleaning of the air system would probably help the smell housekeeping was ok the bed was changed every day , but what the heck is with the open - ended pillowcases that was very annoying we squashed a roach in our room one day , and the carcass remained there on the floor until we checked out there were also little blood stains on our drapes??leaning the drapes on occasion would be nice , too we had a dvd player in our room??ut no dvd?? bring some movies that you??e been meaning to watch , because there are limited tv stationsfood : enough has been said about the food , and i agree with the majority sometimes there was a delicious surprise , such as our experience at the japanese restaurant if you have a late dinner at this restaurant , i would beware get the earliest slots available (6:30) we saw raw fish and meat sitting out at 6:30 that wouldn?? be used until later? br/>and it was hot in there one guest that we met got very sick after eating the 8 pm sushi at the japanese place try their version of strawberry ( fresa ) ice cream??astes like berry bubblegum great coconut macaroons , too i was very careful not to drink the water we brushed our teeth with bottled h2o and avoided ice and poured water as much as we could i avoided all raw fruits and veggies , and most seafood i only had some minor ??? on the second day , and imodium cleared it right up however , since the return flight home , i??e had ??? i have to see my doctor next week clearly , the practice of sanitation is far from what is the norm here in the states one time we were seated in the buffet and the young man who seated us knocked a fork off our table??e picked it right up off the floor and put it right back on our table right in front of us the house beer , presidente , was pretty good and well chilled ( praise be ) ??nd we are picky beer drinkers you might want to consult with your physician before your make the trip to dr?? think bringing a general antibiotic is a good idea just in case resortthere were lots of families at the resort , which doesn?? normally bother us , but it wasn?? a very relaxing or romantic atmosphere with a ton of kids running around , crying , and parents yelling , etc we were puzzled as to why the children?? section of the pool is down by the swim up bar either way , we didn?? frequent the pool very much , as the beach was just too beautiful to miss ( note : hide your beach towels by the pool??urs was snatched and you can be charged up to $25 for missing beach towels ) do bring a raft if you go to the pool the beach and the resort grounds , in my opinion , were the saving grace of the resort hint : avoid the ??end? in the beach , as the current can be a little rough there , and you??l scratch your feet on all the rock/coral??nstead , head down to the beach area by the wedding canopy right outside the official ??wimming area????here is a great place to swim in the ocean there without the hassle of the rocks under your feet the water is just beautiful??arm , clear , perfect to just walk right in the staff work very hard we saw staff who were there from sun up to beyond sun down??nd all were friendly and always greeted us we didn?? engage much with the animation team or the shows at night , but it was evident that they work their butts off we tried to see the michael jackson show the one night , got there 40 minutes early , but still got lousy seats because people were saving rows and rows of seats for their family and friends??alf that didn?? even show up some people ( guests ) were downright rude about it hint : if you see a show , don?? sit in the back section behind the main aisle 
mixed review of majestic my wife and i and 3 other couples stay for a week at the majestic we all had mixed reviews of this resort when we arrived and went to our rooms we were opposite a major construction area right outside our window we complained and stated we requested a room either ocean side or pool side the room were very nice after much discussion we were all moved the next day pool side the resort is beautiful the pool meanders through the resort and is beautiful the grounds are well kept , clean and lovely there are plenty of chaize lounges by the pool or beach the beach was great now the food , we were all disappointed with the selection and quality of the food very few of the staff spoke english and sometimes it was difficult to communicate our needs one night at dinner my wife ordered a beer and a bottle of hot sauce what whe go instead was a beer with hot sauce in it we were hesterical , but that was one of many examples of confusion from the waitstaff all were very nice though the food was mainly latin and not overly tasty some of the fish dinners were ok the guest very 90% latin we are far from racist , but it seemed that everything was geared to the latin guest , espically the shows and music we have been to other latin resorts and the guest were a nice mix of people from us , europe , canada and latin countries we were defiinetly majority the drinks were watered down except in the lobby bars they charged extra for corona beer and top shelf liquor at other resorts there was no extra charges we did a catamaran trip which was a lot of fun and well organized the guys did deep sea fishing and caugt a 50lb mahi mahi that was fun the surrounded area in punta cana holds nothing of interest we did hire a cab for half a day and it was disappointing in puerto plata there was much more to see and do , and we ate at a wonderful restuarant in town we would not go back to the majestic again there are other places that offer more for your money i think mexico is a far better deal than dr and the staff is far more accomadating 
beautiful hotel but would not go back punta cana , majestic colonialwe just returned from the majestic on june 18th the hotel is beautiful , the pool is really a sight to see all the grounds around the hotel are kept beautiful our room was big and very clean there is a lot of walking involved to get from the lobby to the beach our first problem was that most of the employees do not speak english , so its hard to comminicate with them in the restaurants we had a problem getting what we ordered for dinner because they did not understand us , , some nights we did not get our full order we ordered a steak for dinner and they asked us what we wanted to drink and we said a beer , we then asked for tabasco sause for the steak and they put the tabasco sauce in the beer there is no decaf perked coffee , all they have is instant i ca not believe a big hotel hotel like that would not have decaf perk coffee the food was ok nothing to brag about we were told by guests that had been there last year and were returnig again the same week we were there that the quality of the food had gone down since last year the drinks were very watered down to be really honest i would not return to the majestic again 
what your should know about the majestic before you go i thought you should read what people are not telling you about the majestic these are mostly negative but you 've already read the positves over and over again yes , there are mosquitos some of the people we were traveling with did not have any problems but we sure did after returning to our room each afternoon we would kill a minumum of three they seem to like the yellow curtains and bed canopy two mornings i woke up with bites on my face and neck the maids leave your room door open while cleaning always keep your deadbolt locked while in your room the staff does not use the motion sensor to detect if your in your room they will knock and come on in luckily , we were dressed the first time this happened the mini bar guy that came around each morning was the worst for knocking and then opening the door he was great to remember we wanted extra water after telling him the first day do not plan on sleeping in at this resort especially if your in buildings 3 or 4 with low room numbers ( i 3204, 4306, 3110) pay attention to the last two digits when they assign you a room because of the close proximity that the buildings are to each other in the low number rooms create an echo you hear the maids taking carts through the hallways all night long and even one morning there was a maid cleaning the railing with her broom which was a constant banging we were never able to sleep later than 7am any morning these rooms are also close to the nightly entertainment so if you plan on turning in before midnight remember building 4 balconys face the new construction bring your own pillow the hotels were very flat one was not enough and two pillows stacked was too much i suggest not to risk it if you have neck issues we went to the main buffet one night for dinner and found the food to be mediocre our saving grace was the pizza station if they do not have anything to your liking from the premade pizzas ask them to make you a special pizza with the toppings of your choice we had a fantastic pizza they make all of their pizza dough fresh as well as their breads on their dessert bar they had a tray of brown course type of food ( i do not know how to describe it ) i decided to try it and it was coconut and great to give them credit they are trying to serve several nationalities with their food service we always found something to eat so do give everything a try you never know what you may discover internet speed was similar to dial - up you have to purchase time and it 's continuous from the time you first log in we purchased 72 hours and we had 3 days of continuous internet service and then it expires after walking the beach we discovered that the majestic had the most covered areas at the beach and pool this is a huge plus as the sun is strong and we saw quite a few people with burns our over all experience was good i do not want my negatives to discourage anyone from visiting the majestic 
majestic horror i traveled to this hotel with my mother i had just recently finished my masters degree and this was to be a celebratory trip i had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to request a room as close to the beach as possible when we arrived at the resort we were taken directly to our room and found that the hotel had not only honored my request but had upgraded us to a beachfront room with an extremely large balcony we were absolutely thrilled and expected a phenomenal vacation we had read the reviews on tripadvisor and knew to expect sub par food we figured that it would not be that big of a deal given the beauty of our room , the resort , and the beach we were there to relax and enjoy the beach and the sun , everything else was secondary the first night we were there we had dinner at the seafood restaurant on the beach we both woke up during the night with some gastrointestinal issues but by early morning we were feeling better and we were determined to not let it ruin our day the second night we decided to skip dinner after walking into both the buffets breakfast was consistently good so we decided that we would eat alot during that meal as the rest of the food was so awful we had made two reservations at le gourmet , one for the third and the fifth night we were at the hotel after eating at le gourmet the first time my mother fell ill since she has a weak stomach we attributed her sickness to her change in eating habits she stayed in or close to the room the next day but was feeling a little better by the day after however at this point she decided that she would only eat packaged items and tried to adhere to the brat diet - bananas , rice , applesauce , and tea ( this diet is great if you find yourself ill on vacation ) we dined at le gourmet on our fifth night my mother abstained from eating while i foolishly went ahead and had dinner the next morning i woke up feeling like i had been hit by a truck not only was i vomiting and going to the bathroom every 5 minutes , but i had developed a high fever by mid morning i felt as if i had the flu my muscles were stiff and achy and i could barely move we had an excursion planned for that morning so i called the front desk at 6am and asked to speak to the manager on duty i was connected to the night manager , callyx to make a long story short he was rude , argumentative , and unhelpful he told me that i would have to go to medical to get a note from the doctor for him to be able to do anything he then told me that the cost would be $90/pp when i told him that i was unable to walk to the medical facility he told me that i could pay more to have them come to me i told him that the dr visit would cost more than my excursion and he simply said oh well when i asked for the name of the general manager he repeatedly told me that he was the manager there was no language barrier issue , he was purposely being uncooperative when i finally , out of frustration , told him that i did not care who he was b/c he was not helping me his response was if you do not care who i am then i do not care who you are and then he hung up sick and in tears i waited until 9am and called my travel agent back in the us she was shocked and appalled because she books this hotel frequently however both my mother and myself have used the same agent for the past 8 years , generally travel 3-6 times a year each , and we have never complained about a hotel i 'm not sure who she spoke to or what she said but a few hours later the relations manager oscar and the dr come to our room the dr took one look at me , took my blood pressure and temperature and pronounced me very ill oscar apologized for the way we had been treated and promised that room service would bring me anything i liked - so i made my high maintenance request for saltines and bananas he also promised me that he would arrange a meeting with the general manager , whose name i finally found out was jose maria needless to say i never got my meeting we ate bananas and crackers for the last two days of our trip as we were checking out oscar came over to apologize again and to offer a voucher for two free nights if we wanted to return to the resort again we would never return even if the trip was free for all of the naysayers and nonbelievers i just want to clarify that we did not drink the water , we only drank bottled water and did not imbibe any alcoholic beverages we were also very careful about what we ate everywhere we went we heard people discussing their various illnesses and symptoms i always read the reviews on this site and take the negative ones with a grain of salt b/c i know some people are just difficult to please we are not those type of people we went to this resort expecting beautiful beaches and terrible food what we got was a beautiful resort that we were only able to fully enjoy 3 out of the 6 days we were there due to unsanitary food that is unexcusable visit this hotel only if you want to be able to boast to people that you once had e coli or if you prefer unprofessional , uncaring and downright rude management 
dissapointing my fiance and i stayed at the majestic for our honeymoon last week i have to say we were greatly dissapointed first of all , upon check in we were told they needed a document i didnt have and they charged me an additional $1000 this was supposed to be returned as soon as they sorted this out , but the return is still pending on my credit card we had dinner our first night at the seafood restaurant ( outside dining ) this was the worst meal of the trip and we avoided this restaurant and the steakhouse ( both outside ) for the rest of our trip we enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the japanese restaurant i tried to stick to local foods - mahi mahi is their local fish and always tasted fresh the traditional dominican rice and beans were always seasoned well and fresh , we loved the churros served at breakfast our bed was terrible and the canopy fell down twice in the middle of the night we also had a problem with face cloths ( i noticed this came up in a previous post ) we never got them finally the last day we received three one morning we woke up to a blackout there was no electricity or water for about 3 hours this was very frustrating ( and unsanitary ) we enjoyed the pool , had fun kayaking and the animation team was pretty good ( although if i hear it 's raining men one more time i will die it seemed very family oriented , i would consider returning one day when we have children if the food wasnt so bad oh - on our last day we saw a roach in our room i was grossed out and ready to return home 
biggest waste of money after reading the reviews of this hotel from this website i was already prepared to have some issues but not as bad as what happened since i have actually been there i can explain a few of problems that seemed to come up over and over our room had a stench of mold so bad that i could not sleep the first night and for every night after that we had to have someone come to our room and spray this green stuff that covers up the smell they come down no questions asked because they know the room smells horrible we think that when the hurricane hit that area a few years ago the we were in was flooded and it was never properly fixed so mold is growing somewhere ( or everywhere ) but , in the other building the rooms smelled fine we were supposed to have a room with an ocean view but what we got was a room that faced the ocean with the activities building blocking our view when we first got there ( after waiting for 3 hours for our room to be ready ) i kicked off my shoes to unload our suitcases into our stinky room and my feet felt like they had dirt on them the bottom of my feet were literally black and covered in dirt who knows what was going on in there while we waited for our room but they were not cleaning it we also had a problem with the face clothes i ended up having to hide one in a bag that i carried around with me we had to call every day to get one our room was never serviced completely , if the maid came then the person filling up the minibar would not our expresso was never restocked and they do not give you clean glasses in the room to drink out of they rinse them out ( in the bacteria infested water in the room ) and just put them back so , do not use any dishes in the room they are more than likely dirty no wonder so many people get sick we were there for a wedding with a group of 10 people by the end of the week every one of us had some time of stomach issue the food is horrible at both of the buffets make sure you do not eat anything that you do not see them cook in front of you i had omelets and pasta everyday dinner at the restaurants was actually pretty good every steak we had was cooked perfect i did hear from another couple that the japanese restaurant is not worth the effort the food was so bad i also noticed that the service did not improve after you tipped we left money every day for the maid and we had issues almost every day i stopped leaving money the last 2 days because it did not make a difference also , beware of the bottled water and make sure the seal on the lid breaks and it is actually filtered water we had quite a few bottles that tasted as if they were refilled from the tap or something and the lid on all of them came right off with the seal attached i would not recommend this resort to anyone there is not much to do but relax , eat and drink and the food and drinks are horrible there is no real juice at the bar so if you want anything that has cranberry or orange juice in it you will be disappointed they use some kind of syrup tasting orange or red drink i ended up drinking majestics all week because at least they tasted good do not waste your money it is worth the few extra dollars to go somewhere else 
the food is not majestic the rooms are very nice ? spacious with a jacuzzi , a sitting area and a balcony our room was in the middle of the property overlooking the pool the grounds are beautiful the beach is wonderful ? clean , smooth sand , many palapas and chairs , some rocks in the water , but not troubling the service on the beach is very nice denny , one of the beach servers , always had a smile on his face the pool is spectacular there are plenty of chairs and shade the pool runs the entire length of the property , so you can find whatever atmosphere you want ? the hustle  bustle of being near the pool bar and activities or a more quite spot our only complaints had to do with the restaurants first , we were disappointed that of the two restaurants that needed reservations ( gourmet  japanese ) we could only get a reservation at the gourmet the breakfast buffet was very good ? lots of variety , but nothing spectacular the lunch buffets ( one large in the main building and one at the beach ) were disappointing and repetitive the quality and service at the dinner restaurants was disappointing the steakhouse was the exception regarding quality there the food was quite good the service , however , always seemed rushed overall , the hotel is very clean and quite beaultiful the quality of the food and the service are areas in which there needs to be improvement 
an honest review? well to start off i will no t speak much about my trip to and from the hotel because everything was flawless due to my travel agent ? the real review is of the hotel the best phrase to describe the resort is ??ack of all trades , master of none? the resort has everything in one small space , but none of them are excellent due to the many different rolls each play i went on a small vacation from may 23 to may 27, 2008 the purpose of the vacation was due to a surprise marriage proposal after extended research in this site and other sites i had planned everything so that this trip would be flawless the variable i was not counting on was the resort when i get there they receive me and my girlfriend with a towel , drinks and cookies then i go to the front desk and the check in was done within a few minutes , excellent and then things went wrong? i get to my room and i notice that they , mistakenly , had given me a standard room even though i had paid and reserved an upgraded room ( colonial jr jacuzzi in the balcony ) five months in advance they were very prompt in admitting the mistake , but they told me that they did not have that room available then why do reservations exist i had to stay in a standard room for a day anywho , i didn?? care much because i was there to enjoy my vacation at all costs the same day of my arrival i went to make reservations for the restaurants and for a dinner in the beach ( for my proposal ) , but to my surprise there was no availability for the things i wanted ? the french restaurant was available but who wants to go there after the awful things read about the place , plus is french food in the dr so , defeated in everything i had planned before i impromptu some new plans of my own and a new proposal was set the second day i got the correct room i had reserved 5 months in advance and everything was well but the food? me and my girl were a bit shocked about the food i am the type of person that would eat anything , if you season a rock well i will eat it the steak restaurant , by far , was the best , and then followed the buffet restaurants the buffets were good because you could try things and if they were not good then you just didn?? eat them and pick new things ( trial and error ) the absolute worst was the seafood place in the restaurant you had to pick from a menu ? i was amazed , everything was bad ? i did not know it was possible to ruin garlic shrimp ( camarones al ajillo ) , since its only butter and garlic , but now i know is possible when i was there i was expecting to eat mangu ( a traditional dominican dish ) but none was found , a bit intrigued by this so , we asked one of the waiters why the food was so awful and why they did not have mangu in none of the restaurants and he sincerely told us that recent changes were due to new european management , rather than dominican ( hmmm , no opinions , don?? know who to blame ) to conclude , i did not get sick eating the food ( my college years made this stomach invincible ) but it was not enjoyable , except for the steak house the hotel is beautiful , but not a five star resort as advertised i would like to know who gave the hotel five stars and the criteria?? used rooms were nice and spacious , but nothing out of the ordinary in dr nice pool and beach , but , again , nothing out of the ordinary the staff and the people is what really make this hotel the staff is always courteous and friendly , and even the people staying there make this place fun since me and my girl are fully bilingual , we made many new friendships with the staff and fellow travelers overall , for the price , this resort is ok and entertaining , but for a ??ive star resort? as advertised , is not good my advice to the hotel is to lower the stars so that the expectations are also lowered , or get new management that will make specialties and masters at something , rather than a lot of average things like they say : it?? not quantity is quality my advice to travelers is that if you have a reservation to go there , then go , you will have a good time with the right attitude but if you are not set to go , then do not go well as a new engaged man , i??l tell you that i will not be returning to this hotel even though the hotel is now part of a story in my life there are just way too many options to explore and new ??ive star? hotels opening each year in dr to pick an average one if you have any questions regarding my trip let me know , i just got back and the info is fresh happy travels to all 
neveragain room - very nice , large , very noisy , no door on the bathroom mini - bar is not - only soda and two beers drinks - no alcohol really you must ask for alcohol and watch carefully to make sure they put in more than 1/4 oz no free brand name alcohol name you never heard of with a flavor to match ground - beautifulfood - fair to poor a lot of breading , little meat over cooked and staff as a hard time understanding english most of the time they bring the wrong item - although thay are very nice about it 
loved the majestic hi we returned from the majestic colonial on may 4,2008 after a week stay my husband , daughter and i were down to attend our son 's wedding we booked last septand paid 5300 oo for this resort our trip down , arrival at airport and ride to resort was wonderful we were greeted at the resort with friendly faces , a delious drink and cool refreshing towels , then we took our turn at the desk to check in to find we were bumped to the resort next door , the bahia principe for that day and night and to come backthe next day at 1, after waiting to see our son and grandchild for 9months was a shock they provided a cab over to the next resort and said they would not pay for any other cabs except the one returning the next day so we paid our own cabs over and back to visit , not only we were bumped but also the maid of honors room , the bestman 's room my daughter 's they apologized and gave us a list of compensations of which we only used 2 a massage and free internet another couple that was bumped got a free week there , they only have to pay for there airfare , i heard they were lawyers no matter what , this should of never happened , the bumped file had hundreds of names in it so beware if they would do it to a wedding party , it could happen to anyone once we were settled in our room the next day everything went fine we requested a 2nd floor room in building 3 and was given our request the beds were great , the open concept took a little getting use to , we had alot of ants , but did not bother complaining , we just did not use the coffee pot and kept everything in our suitcases the rooms were spotless cleaned in the morning and again in the evening the only thing we did not get a facecloth the whole week , but after reading this in previous reviews i had brought my own , i have to say richard , victorhotel managerand paeola were fantastic the grounds were spotless , the pool was beautiful , and the food was not bad at all i ca not believe the bad reviews about the food , we are very fussy eaters and we enjoyed alot of great tasting food breakfast at the main buffet was incrediable , i myself would rather eating from the buffet instead of the alacaretes but the rest loved most of the meals they provided the entertainment was not great but there were so many other great things to see and do it was no big deal the location of the resort is quite away from the airport and due to a real bad storm a year or more ago the water is very ruff , i think there was only 1 day the parasailing and catamareans were allowed out , friends of ours were down the beach 15 resorts and there water was very calm in closing the resort , food would probably not go back , unless we paid alot less only because of being bumped and the rough section of the sea 
do not go for the food just came back from this resort may 16 - 22, 2008 the most beautiful pool  beach the resort workers are very friendly that i will say however , what you have read about the food is correct flies are everywhere in the restaurants , my boyfriend is still sick from being sick into our third day into our trip the only good place to eat dinner is in the japanese restaurant the food is cooked in front of you and they are very generous with the portion sizes there steakhouse was just ok the rooms are beautiful except for the fact of the bathroom you have absolutely no space in there we did have one incident where i found a roach in the room @ midnight one night we immediately went to the front desk and was told that someone would come up to spray i 'm sorry , but i was not comfortable with that answer yes , the desk clerk changed our room from a king - to two double beds go figure that - the bellman who help us with our luggage realized that that was not the right thing to do five minutes later the front desk called us to tell us they will put us in a room with a king size bed - why he could not do that the first time is beyond me anyway , the room he put us in , had ants crawling all over the phone we were too exhausted to change again , however they did come to spray the next day if you notice in the maid 's cart , they have roach spray was not happy to see that again , as everyone says remember to bring $1 bills for tips we tipped everyone - they work very hard there to make your stay as pleasant as possible if you want to go to they gym - do not it smells so bad and plus most of the equiptment is broken and the casino smells as well , and the staff there is not friendly at all make sure that you come with all your personal items as the gift shop there is very , very expensive 00 for a tube of toothpaste and $6 00 for a toothbrush i would think about booking this resort for your vacation 
please read my husband and i just returned from a week at the majestic colonial we stayed from may 11 - may 18 i would like to start by how beautiful the place was the weather was terrific a nice breeze and never humid the beach was gorgeous the animation team was excellent soo much fun however , the food not so good i am not a fussy eater or a stuck up person hoping to get more than what we payed for the steakhouse was really good the gourmet was average we would not know about the japanese because our 4th day there my husband got food poisioining i was a little sick but nothing a day in bed did not fix but my husband was deathly ill i had to go to the doctor on the premises for a small fortune they will give you some pills to take and pedialite we spent the last 3 days in bed my husband lost 8 pounds i lost 4 not what you expect when you go to an all exclusive resort we were very careful with the water and food i did not eat anything that did not look right or anything i had seen previously at lunch , which is the case with most of the buffet items the first day back my husband spent the day at the doctors to find out the very expensive pills were nothing but sugar pills be very careful this is one resort i would not return to 
if you have already booked , lower your expections - if you hav not do not stayed here in march i could go on forever and bore you entirely but here are a few brief guidelines service : do not expect any unless you are able to hand out huge tips - and even then it 's not guaranteed food : expect the worst and you will receive it salads are rehashed over and over if you know the taste of old oil you will know where i am coming from they have a hamburger chef for lunch who carries on cooking even though there are already 20 hamburgers ready rooms : yes they do smell and you will get a room overlooking the construction site haughty staff : lots of them especially in the gourmet restaurant just one example , my husband went to apologise that we may be late for our booking 20 30 the hostess pulled a stop watch out pushed it under his nose and said it is now 20 40 your table will be cancelled you have 8 minutes enough said but having made the 20 40 deadline we noticed there were at least 4 tables for two free for the entire evening so there was absolutely no need for this attitude pool : nice pool but you do need to put your towels out they closed the beach for two days during our stay and instead of bringing the beach stools to the pool they brought in two pool attendants who , ( having seen the colour of your money , at least 5 dollars per stool ) would grudgingly assist casino : if you like to gamble then you 'll go there anyway - but be prepared for the most hostile croupiers you have ever encountered order a drink on arrival - it may arrive within the length of your stay alternatively go to the bar which is slightly quicker you will receive neither thanks nor recognition summary : this was a last minute booking and i will not make the same mistake again my thoughts were , the carribean is the carribean , but nothing could be further from the truth we have travelled extensively in this area ( curacao , aruba , antigua , barbados , st thomas , st john 's , barbados ) and have never encountered such hostility if you are unfortunate enough to have already booked here are my suggestions : book a table at the seafood restaurant and order the shrimp starter then order the chataubriand from the steak restaurant ( they will bring it to your table and you will not have to move ) this is the best evening out we had in our stay if you have a complaint go straight to the managers desk at reception - talking to the waiting staff will only result in name calling as i said in the heading if you hav not already booked - do notand if you have lower your expectations 
great resort but beware of food the resort was very nice we had a problem with our room on check in and within 15 minutes we were moved to a much better room the staff , service were great the place was clean and very well run now the food i am a chef by trade and did not think we were going to get exceptional food i know the challanges and cost it takes to run a operation like this , but the food was worst than i could have ever thought both my wife and i got food poisoning i wanted to contact the hotel staff , but my wife did not want to make a big deal of it thank god we both ate very little and had a mild case so it did not total destroy our short trip we later learned as we were leaving that we were not the only ones that got sick i have been in the foodservice buisness for over 20 years and was shock at the food and beverage operation this resort did sooooo many things right , the staff worked very hard , it was disappionting to have the food take away from all this i can not stress how bad it was , when we got our return flight home , the airline serverd us some kind of chicken and instant mashed potatoes and my wife and i thought we were in heaven imagine airline food being the highlight of our culinary experience it seems to me that if they could reduce what they offer and do it right they could be the best resort in the area bottom line - great resort but plan on losing wieght and bring snacks 
majestic might be an overstatement this is a bit late but better than never i know that there have been glowing reviews lately so i hate to be a downer but i was not that impressed grounds : i will agree without a doubt that the grounds of this resort are beautiful the beach is great and i never had a problem finding chairs no one will harass you unless you are bothered by the occasional topless women and children the pools were great , again with ample chairs and no need to go out at the crack of dawn staff worked really hard to keep everyone entertained and were always very friendly and accommodating if i could stay at the pool or beach and not have to eat or sleep then i would have no complaints room : the beds had to be the most uncomfortable that i have every slept on the room stayed humid so it always felt like everything was damp we could never get the temperature right so we stayed cold and wet if that even makes sense i think it 's been mentioned before but be sure to bring your own wash cloth because you wo not be able to get any without a fight not sure what the problem is but it took us a few days to get anything other than a hand or bath towel food : i 've been to countless all inclusive resorts and the food here had to be the worse first it was totally ridiculous that for a few hours between lunch and dinner there was no where to eat each buffet served the exact same food day after day after day the restaurants were not much better and the service was often extremely slow overall i would say if you can eat anything and sleep anywhere then this resort will be just fine for some the shortcomings with the food and room will be justified by the beauty of the grounds - unfortunately i was not one of those people i also did not like that you could not really go anywhere outside the property on your own we did a few excursions that were fun but there were not very many options i was there for 7 nights and after the 3rd night i was feeling a little too confined 
bad and ugly , with very little good my wife and i booked our trip to the majestic in oct of 07' upon arrival at the hotel we were advised as well as many other guests that the hotel was over - booked by as many as 60 rooms and for 2 nights we would have to stay somewhere else we attempted to get them to place us at the rui as we had friends staying there , however they insisted that they did not have an agreement with them and we would have to stay at the gran bahia note to yourselves , stay at the gran bahia principe ambar section if you truely want the 5 star experience we were offered some lame excursions , free internet , free room service , and vip treatment at majestic , we were also more than welcome to go back and forth from the resort as we please how pointless to have to commute to your resort , and free internet ok , so we served our time at the bahia which to our dismay was the best part of our vacation the majestic is far from 5 star i happen to think the breakfast was the worst meal and the others are very so so the room : i forgot to mention we cut our trip short and came home early the room smelled like mold and according to my allergies and how stuffed up i am and was every morning there was a lot of mold in that room horrible bed , actually broken and leaned to one side nothing in this place says 5 stars , nothing it screams for a 5 star rating and outwardly appears as such , but never lives up to it 's obligations to be an actual 5 star resort service was scetchy as it alway is in punta cana , nothing new to report there , but out of all the places we have been in punta cana , barcello beach , palace , bahia , this place had the nastiest room our friends stayed at rui naiboa a resort that was not 5 star according to victor at majestic guess what , their room did not smell like a mold experiment for the local science fair in the end , we left early as i kept getting sicker and sicker the more nights i slept in that room during the day i would fight off everything and feel ok , but as soon as i stepped foot into that room i felt miserable i know that when your on vacation you should never attach any value to the room because you do not want to spend all day in your room in the first place , but when it makes you sick to sleep in your room that 's a problem in the end , they should have never been in a situation to have overbooked by so many rooms , and they should have never placed us in the bahia i 'll be writing my review of the bahia soon the majestic seemed like a serious step - down from the bahia and they need to do their homework on where they send other guests because i can think of 4 people that will not be staying at the majestic ever again ca not believe i am just happy to be home 
resort was beautiful but thats where it ends we just returned from a 5 day stay at the majestic , glad it was not our usual 7 day stay i was ready to come home by the 4th night the property itself is gorgeus and the staff very friendly the rooms clean ( but the bed horrific , asked for a mattress topper but it never appeared ) and the water and pool beautiful it was my first time at an ai and that may sway me to never try one again i should always follow my motto of you get what you pay for the house wines were awful and i never tasted such a horrible margarita in my life i ca not beleive people actually thought the food was edible breakfast was the best and safest meal but that only goes so far if we were not there with a great group of people ( very large group ) we definitely would not have enjoyed the time there as much as we did i did not get sick but did not eat salad and brushed my teeth with bottled water and took pepto 3 days before and the whole time there sadly friends that were leaving with us had to take their teenager to the hospital and did not return till 3 days later and majestic colonial had no rooms available and made no effort to help them so they slept at the hospital for 2 nights my husband survived the time there but has been sick since he has been home too much of a crap shoot for me to ever go back 
just returned from majestic have just returned from ( a somewhat rainy ) week at the majestic colonial i researched on trip advisor for a long time before booking at majestic i have stayed at other ai 's in punta cana and mexico as well i will try and give as unbiased opinion as possible hotel and grounds - just beautiful we stayed in standard suite as another post stated , never saw anyone use their outdoor hot tubs does not seem worth the upgrade the beds were 4 poster , nice tile floors , deck with 2 chairs ( ours faced garden , nice and quiet we especially liked the fact that you could go from one end of the resort to the other without getting wet as all buildings are covered with overhangs decor in restaurants was nothing to write home about maid service - nothing special we had to call every day for extra towels after the first day , we never got extra yellow towels for the jacuzzi tubs in our room cleaning was very good , however bars - bartenders were very friendly , and a buck tip will get you alot of extra liquor unlike the grand bahia principe , you can get drinks in the restaurants bartenders were very friendly , always smiling majestic drink was awesome restaurant service - waiters were not too friendly fortunately , all they did was take your order , then you never saw them again the rest of the staff was very friendly , helpful , and always looking out for you pool - looked like a meandering lazy river clean , clean , clean never crowded , although the hotel was fully booked ocean had alot of seaweed if you walked about 10 minutes away from hotel , no seaweed , very strange spa - had 2 scalp and shoulder messages much more relaxing and got rid of more kinks than regular massage claoudia ( sp ) did a great job both times well worth the money now the most disappointing part ( for me ) the food i do not go to all inclusives expecting gourmet food however , of all the hotels i have been to , i have to say , i was the most disappointed in this food my favorite meal was breakfast the cook making the crepes was amazing there were only a few signs indicating what the food was at lunch and dinner at the buffet the gourmet restaurant offered only 4 choices we walked out of the chinese restaurant after only 1 bite of our food and who uses cereal as toppings for ice cream it got to the point that the food choices were boring because there was not that much that was good ( and we are not food snobs - food at iberostar mayan in mexico was much better bernaise sauce at the steak house did not even have tarragon in it , so it was rather bland the 2 outdoor restaurants , fish and steak had a circus quality to them , and i could imagine them being quite hot in the summer the michael jackson show was terrific the others , eh , , a band played outside on the terrace before the show for dancing , which was quite nice , dancing under the stars in conclusion , did we have a good time no , not unless they completely overhauled their food ( or served breakfast all day 
tainted love the resort layout itself is very nice i do not know if it was the spring break in spain or what but at night they had a night club that was open untill 4am and kids were yelling up and down the hallways almost every night on the hour keep in mind the food here is beyond bland so we decided lets try out the mexican food resteraunt ( do not eat the soup ) 3 out of 4 of us had stuff coming out of both ends , and were in bed for the rest of our trip with mild fevers the drinks are very poor as well nothing is really made , all drinks have pre mixes and they ca not even get that close to a magarita on the positive , beer is better than mexicos staple for tourist the other bad thing is we could not even relax on the beach they have some dude enternaing kids and adults at the top of his lungs over a speaker system , so you never got that wind , wave , beach relax also , the food is mediocre at best if you have been to a all inclusive resort before , you will be disappointed with this one dreams of tulum is 8 out of 10, this is more like 4 out of 10 this resort just did not do a good job entertaining kids , and using there facilities to a better potential 4 out of 10 blahhh 
resort good , food bad we chose this hotel because it was the # 2 on trip advisor and we usually trust the rating and comments on this website we were scared to go after reading all kinds of reviews about this hotel on trip advisormy husband and i traveled in many different countries in all kinds of hotel ratings , as an ex travel agent i also been too many all - inclusive for work in the past and have a good idea of the quality/price for that type of hotel the hotel is very nice and not too crowded , beautiful swimming pool area and on a nice beach i really appreciate the fact that you don?? have to wake up too early to have a chair on the beach or around the pool , there is plenty of space for everyone at any time of the day compare to many all inclusive places where after breakfast no one is sitting on chairs but all of them have towel or personal items to reserve the place we booked a standard room and made a special request for a room on the building 2 far from the constructions well in advance of arrival , facing the swimming pool we got exactly what we requested the real problem of this hotel is : the foodby the way you can make one reservation only per specialty restaurant per week the mexican restaurant was really bad we were really disappointed we saw some people order food and leave 5 minutes later because they couldn?? eat the food special japanese restaurant it?? simply a stir - fry really no big deal but was fine the other asian was really just average the gourmet is a joke they have the d?cor to make it look like classy with a sommelier etc don?? get fooled by that it?? the quality of an okay wedding dinner or an average cruise ship meal they also ran out of more than the half of the menu at 8:30pm our favorite was the steakhouse restaurant , excellent steak and better than the gourmet the buffets indoor and outdoor were just ok and half of the dishes were generally always cold and about half looked like they were dry and needed replacing , about 25% of the dishes were both warm and did not look like they were sitting there for hours the best is the made to order food but there may be a wait almost everybody was complaining about the food in the resort during the time we were there the quality of drinks was not constant sometimes you had a great cocktail and another time it was absolutely disgusting i thought the sizes of the cocktails were fine but most people were walking with their thermos and complaining how small the drinks were we really do not care for the dominican republic , but the facilities itself were on par or better than the other hotels we say up and down the beach keep in mind the resort is 4 stars but the food is really a 2 ? to 3 stars and you will not be disappointed 
beautiful resort , but the service and food not so good i want to start off by saying that the resort is beautiful the service at the resort was not very helpful nor did i find them attentive the food was not the best the only good restaurant that i felt was good was the mexican place the two restaurants that were reservation only were booked while we were there went for five days and four nights with my friends my friends were not impress with the resort either did not see any activities for children and the club at the resort is small the casino is small and the drinks were not really that great was not impressed at all with punta cana i feel that punta cana is over rated , this is my personal feelings for a five star resort majestic colonial really did not live up to it 's ratings was really disappointed with my experience there for a first timer going to punta cana and a five star resort , was very disappointed

great service overall , but just returned from majestic colonial resort , punta cana not having been to the region prior , nor knowing anyone who had , we had no idea what to expect i believe this contributed to some sense of disappointment with this trip the grounds are beautiful , the place is immaculately clean the employees are busy , busy , bees always cleaning , sweeping , replacing , doing their best to maintain everything and they will do everything to attempt to satisfy your needs the selling point of the resort seems to be the fact that it is all - inclusive all one can eat and especially drink the problem for us was 1) the food was terrible , 'tho there was always great effort to present it attractively , and 2) not being heavy drinkers we found little to do other than lounge by the pool because of weather conditions ( of course the resort had no control over the storm which kept everyone off the beach for two days ) the pool area was quite crowded and short of lounging chairs not being near even a small city shopping area we never saw much of the life of the country we did take the one day trip to the island for beach and bbq this trip was nice , but way too long it was a 2- hr bus ride to the marina where we boarded a catamaran following our time on the beach we had another looong return ride to the hotel families with small children seemed to have a good time with the youngsters being able to plop around the pool and certainly the hearty drinkers enjoyed the never empty glass of whatever it was they wanted to drink my advice then , would be to take a good book or two , snag a lounge chair , just relax , read , and drink up 
too bad the majestic spoiled an otherwise good vacation i intentionally waited 8 days to write this review to allow the resort 's senior manager ( oscar ramirez ) the opportunity to address our concerns ramirez had promised to discuss our concerns with the resort 's manager that day and contact us personally get back to us immediately to discuss what the resort could offer as compensation for our inconveniences as he called them well , we have yet to hear from mr ramirez and i doubt that we ever will consistent with our week at this resort , this was likely just another empty promise hoping that we would just go away we have and intend to stay away from this resort or any majestic resort for that matter on the positive , the beach and weather in punta cana are outstanding we will likely be back but not at this resort here are my comments : rooms : we were first put in a room facing a construction site for the new hotel looking at a dominican republic construction site at a supposedly 5 star hotel is not my idea of a vacation if you are assigned a room with the number starting with a 4, i recommend that you immediately demand another room all room numbers starting with 4 face the construction site they did move us to another room with an excellent view of the pool unfortunately , the air conditioner leaked leaving us to walk on wet marble floors every night secondly , the power went off 3 times in our room leaving us with no lights or air conditioning and needing to chase hotel staff to get it turned on again food : the food is average at best we 've travelled enough and this was the worse buffets we 've seen to date the steak house on the beach was probably the best but average our travel representative actually recommended that we do not eat at le gourmet , their top end restaurant apparently , 10 travellers over 2 weeks prior to our arrival had been hospitalized for gastro - intestinal problems after eating at le gourmet obviously , we did not chance it be quick to make reservations for the japanese restaurant because when we tried to book on our second day there , the only opening was on the wednesday at 9:30 pm , two days before leaving service ( lack of ) : service was our biggest issue it really does not matter whether you tip or not , the service does not change the same behaviour was encountered in most area including the maid , the bartenders , etc i guess that $2 00 to $5 00 tips are not sufficient some restaurant staff did provide very good service our biggest problem came after our 14 year old daughter was not allowed to participate in beach and pool volleyball events on 3 separate occasions i know she 's a bit small for her age but other kids that she had befriended and were 2 years younger than her were allowed to play after i questioned the captain of the animation team , he accused me of lying to him about her age and walked away only after my wife went to complain at the front desk and that the animation manager was on his way to resolve this issue that this individual began backpedalling the animation team member who would not allow our daughter to play ( same guy all 3 times ) responded with arrogant rudeness when my wife informed him that the animation manager had specifically instructed them to allow my daughter to play i truly believe that the animation team 's role is to girate their crotches disguised as entertainment for as many women as possible at this resort do not get me wrong , i really do not care but this behaviour is blatant everywhere the animation team goes my daughter 's 12 year old friend was actually hit on by a waiter at lunch so keep an eye on your kids/teenagers getting anything resolved took many trips to the front desk with empty promises , etc culminating with a senior manager committing to contact us to resolve who we 've never heard from since i estimate that we wasted about 1 full day trying to get some service and issues resolved hotel management does not appear to be interested in customer service which is strange for the resort business i 'm not surprised that this hotel has dropped from #1 to #3 in punta cana and i 'm certain that it 's rating continues to fall entertainment : average lip sync shows the michael jackson show is propbably the best pool and beach entertainment is often the same and lacks imagination in closing , i will say that other guests were satisfied with the hotel however others also had significant issues maybe it 's like a lottery if you 're lucky , everything will go well and you 'll be pleased 
bacon garbage this was possible the worst food experience i have ever had one of the items on the buffet ( which is by the way your only option for breakfast and lunch ) was actually labeled bacon garbage , use this as an indicator for the entire dining experience also , the drinks were awful only the worst well liquor out there was available ( **you could get stoli and jw red at the hotel upstairs lobby bar only ) , the wines were horrendous , and your only beer option was presidente frozen drinks , while you had several different color options , all had the same pina colada taste and they were unable to figure our how to successfully add rum to it while the grounds , beach and pool area were beautiful , not one of the pool hot tubs was actually hot we were very disappointed overall and would not recommend the majestic 
absolutely beautiful resort very large beach , amazing pool that runs the length of the resort , ample cabanas and lounge chairs for guests my first impression : stunning go to my room , everything is gorgeous bed was comfortable , bathing areas private enough did have one maintenance problem which was solved very quickly i really only have two complaints , food and customer service there was a huge selection of food , yes but that entire selection of food was absolutely disgusting , not to mention unsanitary very surprised that i did not get sick by the end of my trip on to customer service the language barrier here is pretty bad , and i think that this is mostly the downfall of the customer service side looking back at everything , it was a lovely trip , but i starved for a week 
we just returned ( a group of six , over middle agers ) from a beautiful resort we stayed 10 days the reception with its drinks and cold cloths was as described i had e - mailed to request for our group to be in the same area and this was done we were poolside , in the 200 block the room was spotless and the bed had a pillow like top i had no problem with noise at night some of our friends had trouble getting facecloths but we had plenty the bathroom set up is not as bad as it sounds in the reviews our majestic suite allowed for room service and that was prompt the mini bar was well stocked i brought my laptop and bought internet service for the room ( $10 daily ) it had its problems but staff were responsive , even having a tech person ( carlos ) come to the room to trouble shoot at check out , after discussion of internet problems , two days charges were deleted the pool was beautiful there were quiet areas and the more active areas with the animation team i went to a yoga class and spanish lessons lots of available fun a great photo opportunity is available with the visiting animals there is maria , a huge iguana ( lovely ) and milly , a funny little monkey i chose not to pose with the parrots but i regret missing the huge blond cobra photos are reasonable at 10 for a nice shot the beach was beautiful you can walk from one resort to another ( majestic seems the best ) , there is plenty of shade and the water was fun i went to the spa twice , and that should tell you i was pleased staff were fine , most of them sweet , funny and kind english is fluent with mostly management , but you can still work it out the saff work incredible long hours and you get to see the same faces in different places i tip , and a lot of this staff deserves a little extra the drinks in the lobby bars were the best as written so many times there was nice music up until 10 pm then the show starts i enjoyed michael jackson but friends said the other shows were lame despite all of this i would not go back to this resort the food was unacceptable considering the quality of the other services , this is a shame i am not picky and i have no digestive problems but i was sick several days while on vacation as was another member of the group i am aware of the differences in food handling techniques but i observed many lapses in sanitation from staff and additionally food was not tasty often it was not hot or it was dry , tough or heavily salted service at the chinese area of the japanese restaurent was beyond poor and the food quality was inconsistant one night the food was good we were so happy , even if there was an hour wait for the entree a few nights later the same dish was inedible and we all left mid meal and went to the buffet the pasta and pizza at the buffet are great the breakfast is good the bread is great that still leaves a lot of meals to fill the gourmet restaurant was alright one night , not good another the steakhouse ( an open restaurant with flys ) was frantic with many people waiting and general confusion the food was alright but i would not suggest eating from the open salad and desert bars part of our group ate at the fish reataurant and it was inedible we walked through the caribbean restaurant and chose not to eat there i do not go to the islands for gourmet food and i have been to many all inclusives this resort needs to address its issues with its dietary service 
not for young families we went to the majestic during presidents week we are a family that have a 2 and 5 year old we were told how great this resort is for families older kids are fine , but not small ones there will be nothing for them to do in the evening , and very limited food choices a few positives the resort is quite nice pool and beach are beautiful staff is friendly , but very hard to communicate with i had heard tipping was greatly appreciated and worth your while trust me - we tipped everyone , and got no better service food was good , but we had limited exposure due to having 2 small kids you will be stuck with the buffet now to the bad stuff our toilet and bed were broken upon arrival fixed the next day needless to say my husband and i did not sleep at all the first night - not great nothing for the kids to do at night entertainment starts at 10pm they did show a movie at 7pm - in spanish ( we are from ny ) once we put the kids to bed on the first night , we sat on our terrace ( across from the spa ) at 8-9pm they started removing the roof ( palm/thached ) chopping it off then carting it away in a truck i called the front desk at 10pm and they said they would be done soon theycontinues the next night as well long stoy short much more happened we all got sick day 3 and decided to go home we aere all quite sick doctor at the place was a joke we lost a ton of money coming home early , but we were glad when we were home ( came home in a snowstorm we have never left a vacation early feel free to contact me 
please fix the food my husband  i stayed at the majestic from feb 23 to feb 29 and chose the resort based on trip advisor reviews our goal was a relaxing vacation at a nice beach , and that wish was fulfilled there were many things we liked , but some things need attention to make this resort deserving of its ranking things that were great : ? check in was smooth richard greeted us , showed us to our room and helped with our restaurant reservations such a nice man he was very helpful before our stay and really showed personal attention we had booked a swim up room (2129) and we were not disappointed it was worth the extra money and we loved the location , about halfway between the lobby  beach the room smelled just a little musty , but i brought a room freshener , which took care of the problem the bed was very comfortable and bedding looked fairly new the room was very quiet and we slept well air conditioning was adequate , and easy to control the room was clean with only two mosquitoes sighted and no bites during our stay the robes and treats ( champagne , fruit platter , sushi , and grapes  wine ) delivered on four nights were a nice touch ? the beach and pool were beautiful and it was wonderful to be able to get chairs and palapas without playing the towel game the beach is great for walking and is so beautiful with all the palm trees the pool was always clean and has many quiet nooks to hang out the swim up bar was a lot of fun at happy hour drinks were good the signature majestic drink is delicious they make a great cosmo at the downstairs poolbar the staff were very friendly for the most part and were always smiling and happy it helps to smile and try to speak a little spanish the animation team was friendly , but not overbearing they tried to get guests involved , but took no for an answer if you weren?? interested ? evening entertainment on the plaza , the sax player and combo , were very good ? it was nice to be able to go to restaurants without making reservations ? the resort is a nice size you can walk from the beach to lobby in about 5 minutes needs improvement : ? where?? chef gordon ramsey when you need him he?? have a field day here the food in itself will probably keep us from returning the buffets are reminiscent of college cafeteria food soups and hot foods were cold , cold foods were warm beef was tough things weren?? displayed to even attempt to make them look appetizing there weren?? enough tongs for all the dishes ( this sounds picky , but when you think of how many people touch the tongs , it really spreads illness we did have a few good restaurant meals , but service was often rushed you didn?? finish one course before the next arrived some of the restaurant meals were awful ( i can give you more details if you like breakfast at the main buffet is probably the best meal of the day lunch is not good anywhere at lunch there are too many logjams at the buffets people pile up waiting for pasta , grilled items , and panini sandwiches they need to come up with a way to serve simple , tasty , appetizing food quickly for lunch and what is that tacky hut doing in the middle of the palapa restaurant ? maintenance is an issue i can see this place going down hill fast from lack of maintenance things stayed broken all week the ice machine near our room didn?? work one of the shower heads at the beach shower broke off  was never fixed a halogen light kept blinking off  on at the plaza stage where the sax player  band play walkways around the pool have potholes there?? a path at the bottom of one of the bridges at the pool that is pieces of stones just sitting in some shale people kept tripping on the stones all week this really needs fixed before someone gets hurt on the other hand , we saw a maintenance worker polishing the floor in the lobby at 9 pm while people were trying to walk through or sit and relax this seemed like bad timing to me ? sickly landscaping trees and shrubs don?? look healthy grass is lumpy no birds or animals ? not enough public restrooms by the pool  beach please put up some paper towel holders and more soap dispensers there is just one soap dispenser per restroom and very inconveniently placed paper towels got wet setting on the sink counter i saw so many people go to the bathroom , rinse their hands without using soap then proceed to the palapa restaurant where they touch those tongs that are in such short supply no wonder people get sick on our third day , i was sick and confined to my room with diarrhea , vomiting and severe headache i was unable to eat or drink much the following day , but was ok for a few days , then the sickness returned just in time to get on the plane my husband never got sick , but we ate different things tiny plastic drink cups make sure you bring your own cup iberostar used larger plastic cups that they rewashed it bothered me to think about how much plastic was going into the garbage between the bottled water and the drink cups 
a fair stay at the majestic we stayed at the majestic from february 16 to the 25th 2008 i have a mixed opinion of the hotel we had great weather and the resort was clean but it was not the best check in : i called the day before and spoke to someone in reservations and explained that we would arrive late i requested connecting rooms or rooms next to each other with 2 double beds i also explained that since we have young children we wanted a room in a quiet area i was told we would be assigned rooms 2203 and 2204 we checked in at night there were no adjacent rooms i saw our rooms cards and the rooms we were assigned were crossed off i asked why they were given away and they told me it was because of late check in we were given two rooms near the theatre and overlooking the construction they both had king beds and we were told that they would have another bed in the rooms waiting the rooms did not have beds waiting one room had a spill on the floor of something sweet and was hot and full of flies the other room was fine it was 2 hours before they brought the beds and cleaned the room the construction woke us up at 7:30am two days later , we were moved to building 2 in the middle to far end of the resort overlooking the pool it was much better rooms : building #1 overlooks the grand paradise resort next door if you are in the high number of building #1 you will see and smell the restaurant building #2 ( the best in my opinion ) overlooks the pool and has some ocean view rooms it is generally quiet and easy access to the pool and beachbuilding #3 overlooks the other side of the pool and in the early numbers some of the resort and wedding gazebo it is the second best building as long as you are not near the theater which is noisy at night building #4 is by far the worst unless you are really close to the beach it over looks the construction and the early numbers are near the theater as well the rooms are spacious compared to other resorts they have open bathrooms which makes them look larger but can be embarrassing if you end up getting a sick stomach at night there is little to no privacy if you are staying with friends and not close family or if you are staying with teenagers who like to use the bath alone the beds are aged and in need of replacement the pillows are foam the bedspreads have been used a few too many times in one room we had a new sofa but in the other the sofa was worn through and ragged in other words , the furnishings can use a replacement they also have few drawers to put your things but adequate closet space they give terry robes which are nice and the bath towels are large in one room the drain on the tub was broken and the magnifying mirror was torn from the wall these things were never fixed during the stay there is a nice terrace to sit outside with a rack for hanging clothes the maids always keep the rooms clean the mini bar has 4 bottles of water , soda and two beers daily the grounds : the grounds are kept clean at all times the staff takes pride and picks up all of the debris daily the grounds are large and spacious and the resort never appears crowded the main pool is huge it is bigger than at most resorts there is more than one quiet area for people who do not prefer the entertainment and activities by the pool there is always a chair and never a fight for an umbrella or a seat which is nice the only bad part about the pool was more a complaint from my children it was boring it is just a pool there is not a water slide , a wave pool , a lazy river , or a water recreation area for children as in most of the resorts we have visited it is just a huge pool of course , that didn?? bother me but it did make it a little more difficult to keep the children entertained the beach is gorgeous the water was fairly calm and clean the sail boats and kayaks are free as well as boogie boards although there is a wait to sail there are plenty of umbrellas and showers as you exit the beach the sand is soft and the beach is cleaned daily the food : in my opinion , the food was very limited it was probably the poorest selection of any buffet in an all - inclusive from my experience we are not picky eaters there was always something to eat it just wasn?? great for example , at the buffet , they would often run out of something , like grilled chicken midway through the lunch service and not have more also , there was just less selection a la carte restaurants were a little better ? not great but better we enjoyed the churrasco at the rodeo steak house we did not enjoy the lobster at the seafood as it was severely overcooked we enjoyed fresh fish at the mexican and the oriental as well as fairly good egg rolls the best part about the restaurants was that most did not require a reservation you can just show up and they will normally seat you within a few minutes the only required reservations are the hibachi and the gourmet the hibachi was disappointing it was not done like the other resorts or like our local hibachi restaurants the cook just cooked ? however , on other nights i heard people cheering so it is possible that it was just our cook that was new and not all of the cooks 
amazing grounds the grounds of this hotel are spectacular and are kept in immaculate shape the gorgeous pool that goes almost from hotel lobby to beach was put to great use and was an easy way to spend the day we (4 couples ) were very impressed with the staff who were very courteous and always helpful the rooms were in need of some repair and our a/c broke near the end and was not fixed , although through no fault of the hotel our stay was enjoyable as far as the ammenities go but quite frankly , the food was a huge disappointment when you pay a premium to go to a place such as this , i believe that the food should be top notch and it was far from it breakfast was acceptable but lunch and dinner were extremely poor and again for the money we paid , unacceptable although i cannot with total certainty say it was the food , all 8 of us got some form of stomach ailment plus my wife got a bladder infection the whole experience should be a good one , not just pieces of it unfortunately food is a large piece for this reason alone i put this experience at a 3 star rating and would not recommend this hotel 
not impressed went here for a wedding wedding was well done but lots of additional charges for the bride and groom resort was not a 5 star more like a large 3 star though fairly new it was in need of repairs rooms are adequate but we had a great view of the tree line separating us from the resort next door it would have been nice to have lounge chairs on the balcony room was cleaned at varying times during the day make sure you put the dead bolt on the door when in the room because they will come in with you there it did not help to give a tip to the maid we still did not have pillow cases one night and for much of the week we had no face cloths tipping the waiters did not insure prompt service either food was not very good everyone in our group got travellers diarrhea and nausea towards the end of the week a group of 50 americans were also all sick one of our group was stuck in the elevator one night and had to be pulled out between floors by 5 staff members poorly laid out facility long walk to everything and difficult to get around the pool with only two bridges not a good spot for a disabled person 
my wife and i just returned from the mc ? jan , 18-27 previously we have been to jamaica twice , mexico twice and dominican republic twice ( puerto plata and la romana ) , so we have something to compare this experience with we booked the majestic suite , and guess what on our arrival there were no rooms of this type available , despite my advance reservation and an e - mail exchange with roberto so we??e been downgraded to the regular suite for the first night in return we have been offered a free massage ( which we didn?? want ) , and free late check - in ( which we didn?? need ) the front desk lady was completely useless , running between us and her manager until i suggested that we would rather speak directly to him based on other reviews , it looks like the overbooking of more expensive suites may be standard practice for mc however , the suite we received on the second day was great another disappointment with the front desk was their complete inability to help us with the coffee - maker ? nobody showed up to assist us after 3 calls the beach is beautiful , probably the best we had ever seen mc beach was far less crowded then the neighboring bahia and riu the ocean is not as quiet as in jamaica or in la romana , and the swimming area is pretty limited maybe punta cana is just not my place the food was ok , the main buffet had plenty of variety , but , as was already mentioned in one of the reviews , the food is not labeled so if you have any dietary restrictions it might be a problem restaurant was ok , the chinese - japanese so - so and i caught a stomach virus during the last day of our stay ( first time that ever happened to me in the caribbean ) so no really good impressions from food another disappointment was the complete absence of birds and small animals ? the usual part of any caribbean resort in mc they have 2 cages with 2 parrots in one of them , and 6-8 pigeons in the other one i found this strange ? in contrast we saw plenty in la romana , only 1 5 hours of driving from mc 
nice but would not go back my boyfriend and i recently took a trip to the majestic in january the resort is very nice with lush landscaping and is very clean although we had a good time there were some problems our room was not ready when we first checked in which is not that big of a problem because we spent time at the bar however , we were told to come back in 30 minutes and the room would be ready of course we came back and then they told us another 35 minutes so we waited for a while for the room the check - in process itself is very chaotic and the staff are just running around like chickens with their heads cut off the one thing we were very upset about was the fact that they had us checking out a day earlier thank goodness the departure bus service ( which you have to register with so you can find out what time your bus is leaving ) noticed that they had us leaving the wrong day well , trying to correct that was hell they kept telling us we had to prove to them that we were staying til the 31st and not the 30th well , that was pretty hard to do since they had our itinerary which they requested when we checked in the pool and beach are very nice and we had no problems getting towels or lounge chairs the food is bland and they do not label anything at their buffets so you are constantly walking around wondering what the food actually is plus , every buffet is the same the only restaurant that was good was the le gourmet get reservations and eat there the chinese and steakhouse restaurants are decent as well the rooms are ok the bed was like sleeping on the floor the mattress was so hard i have never slept on something so hard in my life the bathroom is tiny well the toilet area you feel cloisterphobic if you shut the door to use the bathroom the shower is big enough to fit five adults and i cant understand why they made that so big and the toilet so small also , room location is key we paid for an upgrade to have a pool side room , which was nice my boyfriend and i are not partiers we like to relax when we go away it was very hard to do this at colonial majestic they have weddings here daily which is fine during the day but at night , the wedding receptions are held at the pool bar which is right smack in the middle of all the rooms and of course , right in front of hours so from 7pm to 12am every single night , we had to listen to loud music and hollering guests i mean , i 'm all for having fun at weddings , but this resort needs to find a reception area that does not interfere with its other guests i did not pay for a five star resort to hear someones wedding all night long plus , you can hear the entertainment from other areas of the resort as well the only way for peace and quiet is to book a room by the ocean , but this resort is not worth all that money the weather was beautiful and we enjoyed relaxing by the pool everyday but we will never go back to majestic take this review as you see fit i read all reviews before i went and i took the positive ones over the negatives wish i didnt do that think about it before you book 
overall , a nice resort my wife and i just returned from our stay at the majestic we were there from feb 7th - 11th since i booked this trip six months ago i had a lot of time to read the reviews on trip advisor like others before me mentioned , the reviews at either end of the spectrum ( i , worst resort ever or the best resort in the world ) should be taken with a grain of salt clearly the majestic is a nice place and probably one of the best in punta cana but it also has its flaws and is definitely not the 5 star resort it 's oftentime advertised as arrival - our flight arrived in the late afternoon on a thursday many reviews have stressed the importance of not taking pre - arranged shuttles from the airport i booked mine way in advance and really did not feel like making changes so we took the shuttle we had no problems no waiting in long lines at the airport or anything like that the van was very comfortable there were only 6 of us with 4 going to the majestic and 2 going to the riu palace ( two resorts down the beach ) so it was not as if we were making a ton of stops i 'm pretty sure the transfer would have been worse had we arrived on a friday or saturday i 'd keep that in mind when booking check - in - again , this seemed to be a major complaint by many of the negative reviewers we were fortunate to arrive in the late afternoon so the lobby was nearly deserted of new arrivals we were greeted by the famous victor who was as advertised - very accommodating and professional he not only checked us in but escorted us to the dinner reservations desk and walked us through making reservations for the week he then accompanied us all the way to our room which was at the other end of the resort nearest the beach - probably a 10 minute walk he explained the room 's amenities and what was included in our package and explained the layout of the resort it was all very professional and much appreciated i 'm not sure why we received the royal treatment by the manger ( or one of the managers ) of the resort all of the arriving guests i saw had to find their rooms on their own i think the service we received was due to a ) the lack of guests checking in at the time we arrived and b ) the fact that i called the resort 4 times in the previous month to confirm my reservation and also emailed them the week prior ( as others have recommended ) check - in could not have gone better room - we had an ocean view suite in building 2 - room 2154 the room was very nice and well situated no foul odor or exposed wires as reported by other reviewers i would recommend for those staying in an ocean front suite to request a room on the second or third floor for optimum ocean views we were on the ground floor and could see the ocean ok , but the second floor would have been nicer one tip : confirm on arrival what plan you have i was not aware that i had purchased the 'supreme package ' which gave us free room service ( not included in the standard all - inclusive ) and premium alcohol no complaints about the room grounds - the resort 's grounds are immaculate there is no doubt that the grounds crew does a wonderful job maintaining a beautiful landscape pool - even the most negative reviews gushed about the pool and rightly so the pool is the best i 've been in it meanders through the center of resort , around various bars , the spa , and restuarants i felt that best thing about the pool was that the areas in which to lounge in were spread out in pockets it 's was not as if you looked up the pool and saw chairs lining it all the way to the beach this design eliminated the feeling of being in a crowded resort pool and , aside from the wet bar area , the pool areas were fairly quiet beach - the beach was nice it 's a half moon shaped beach ( jutting into the ocean ) and always felt uncrowded my wife and i took a long walk down the beach and felt that the majestic 's was the nicest out of the any of the resorts around it we never had any problem finding beach chairs i much prefer a beach on the caribbean sea , however the atlantic coastline was fairly rough even though our beach was guarded by a reef 200 yards away from the shoreline the water was warm and clear entertainment - the entertainment was surprisingly good i 'm using the first one to want to leave a resort show , but the shows involving the local dance troupe ( the stars are here and the michael jackson show ) were really good food/drink - ok , here 's where i start siding with the negative reviews my wife and i put a lot of emphasis on the importance of the quality of food in whatever resort or hotel in which we 're staying i can honestly say that this is my first vacation ever that i did not enjoy one good meal most of the food was really bland and fairly tasteless even the reservation - only restaurants - le gourmet and taino ( japanese ) - produced really bland food i never expected the low quality of the food , even after reading all the bad reviews i was really shocked and disappointed the supreme buffet was , unfortunately , the best option for food there the drinks were ok it seemed they got worse the farther away from the lobby you went the bars in and around the lobby produced really good drinks oh , and expect the worst wine you 've ever had seriously - it was like drinking blueberry schnapps the wet bar and beach bar were just ok if you 're the type of person that just wants to go and enjoy the fun and sun and food is secondary , do not worry about the food it 's not really terrible or anything it 's just not as good as we would have wanted people - the cool thing about this resort is that it is very diverse in fact , i would say that americans were in the minority - there were a ton of europeans ( especially spanish ) and canadians it was nice to meet people from all over the world and not feel like the resort was dominated by americans but , as luck would have it , i was again embarrassed by a few of my countrymen ( i stress a few - most were great ) why is it that drunk and obnoxious americans need to always make a scene most everyone there was nice and quiet and kept to themselves except for those two or three groups of americans who had to direct attention to themselves while drinking their 40- oz insulated mugs full of presidente ( which i found ironic considering how quickly they were consumed ) i 'm not trying to tell anyone to not have fun - my wife and i are under 30 and drank all week - but seriously , what is the need for the constant attention - seeking commotion what 's wrong with having a good time without reinforcing the stereotype of the tommy boy - esque american aside from some slight annoyances , we had a good time 
majestic " do not go " i will get right to the point for what you will spend at this resort , do not go it is not at all worth it the staff is the rudest i have ever experienced the staff thinks people do not study their language and will put all foreign people down , thinking nobody understands them they overbook their hotel , so if you book a room upgrade forget about getting it the staff would rather clean ashtrays then help you the maids never clean the rooms , the surrounding area is a garbage dump , flies everywhere the only nice thing to say is the beach but you can get that anywhere in mexico and also be treated with respect do not waste your money in a place they do not respect you 
" okay " time at the majestic let me start off with a tip that i wish someone would have told us before we left *bring a big travel mug with you the cups are small at the resort so if you want a big cup of coffee or a big 'pina colada ' or beer to walk around with - bring a travel mug with you we booked our trip because the majestic was rated #1 on tripadvisor it 's now slipped to #2 we had better service at a 3star resort in la romana than we did here let me say the positives : richard at the front desk was very friendly and helpful i contacted him before we left as i did not want a room facing the construction he took care of us and we got a beautiful room we had a colonial junior suite and it was lovely there was a huge terrace overlooking the ocean the housekeeping staff was very friendly and kind we had rum , wine , champagne , whiskey , pepsi , chocolate , water , coffee and espresso in the room aside from the chocolate , it was re - stocked every day the walk in shower is really nice and had lots of hot water and pressure there was a really comfy terry robe to use - i loved it there is an iron  ironing board in the room - ours did not work very well but we did not need it much anyhow the pool is outstanding however it was too cold to swim around in when we were there there are plenty of chairs but you have to play the towel game if you want to get one it really is not fair to put your towel on a chair at 8am so it can be yours at 2pm it 's a little annoying - wish that could change but never a problem getting a drink the main drinks are from 'slushy ' machines the main buffet had lots to choose from we enjoyed the seafood restaurant we had the lobster twice - very yummy the gym was adequate it smelled pretty musty and could use a good cleaning it had free weights , treadmills , some machines and benches you could certainly get a good workout there it was air conditioned and music was always playing at the piano bar , a young gentleman played the piano every night it was very nice to sit and listen to him while having a coffee or drink the shows were pretty corny but that is personal opinion we avoided the disco as it was too smoky it would have been nice if the resort had a beach party one night or had some night time activities/games we did have bugs in our room lots of ants and a few mosquitoes i 'm still scratching at the bug bites on my legs i 'd wake up each night with a few new ones the service staff at the buffet needs some training we are not demanding people but a smile would be nice there is a language barrier if you do not speak spanish , learn a few key phrases before you go basically - - - if you want good service , you have to tip ( at least that is how it was for us ) it seemed the more you tipped , the nicer they were to you at the last resort we stayed in , there was a no tipping policy and everyone got great service , every day , from every one ( we should have went back there ) now - i 'm not saying we got bad service from everyone the seafood restaurant had good service every time we were told not to go to the steak house as the meat was tough and food bad we avoided it here 's the bad stuff : i got very very sick after eating at the so called gourmet restaurant the next morning was the worst i have felt in my life i spent the day in the room as i did not want to travel to far from the 'washroom ' it took 5 days to get back to myself it was not pleasant others got sick as well ( see past reviews ) there are cockroaches we had a laugh at a bunch of them that were swarming ( a nest maybe ) in a wicker table across from the piano bar when you put a warm drink on the glass , they would emerge ( under the glass ) we pointed it out to the waitress who got startled at the sight of them i hope they take care of the problem before you get there they had men wearing masks spraying chemicals on the plants in mid day the problem is that they had masks and we did not it 's not pleasant to get a whiff of that stuff when you walk by be prepared to get grabbed and hassled when they have the 'market ' if you want to buy a souvenier , you will be hounded a man wanted us to pay $130 american for a little blue necklace i laughed out loud actually we refused but he would not let us walk away haggling went on for about 10 mins well guess how much we got it for as soon as we left that vendor , there are 10 more grabbing at your arms to pull you to their tables 
not very majestic our punta cana vacation began with a nice landing at a beautiful airport the drive to the hotel was about 25 mins , but it was not a scenic drive at all all of the roads were broken down , and some new roads were under construction but you can tell that construction was at a halt , so who knows when they finish building some decent roads once there , the entrance to the hotel was not spectacular but the lobby was nice we were immediately greeted with a tropical drink that was delicious check in took too long we were there for about 30 mins and there was only one person in front of us the vacation began with the wrong room i paid for the colonial jr suite , and we got was a standard jr suite ( which does not come with room service ) i made this aware to one of the managers and they told me that they had overbooked the hoteland they had nothing else available i was offered free internet and a 25 min massage , which was nice , but it did not make up for the room anyways , we decided to put this aside and enjoy the vacation , and we did the beach location is great very nice beach chairs the hotel has 7 restaurants but only 2 were great , the japanese and chinese the other ones were ok - a bit tasteless , not enough seasoning , and their desserts tasted like they were sugar - free i would not eat from the restaurant by the beach it was completely open ( which was nice ) but there were flies all over the food , and there was no way to control it the room was nice , not spectacular , but nice i have stayed in 5 star hotels before and the majestic was not up to par , as far as the look of their buildings many had concrete cracks , and they did not pay much detail to construction , like the bathrooms , you could see a bad tile job in the shower we could not control the hot/cold water it was either too hot or cold the free internet that we were offered was a pain each day they made me go to the lobby for a new username andpassword which was very far from our room after getting the internet info , it would not work so i would have to get on the phone with tech support each time the entertainment was horrible they had some guys do some corny games not professional entertainment at all not even close to what you see at a cruise ship the pool was very nice it was our anniversary i asked them to do something special in our room that they they said that they will fill up the tub with bubbles and rose pedals , but that i would have to buy the pedals in conclusion the hotel was nice , but i was expecting so much more 
bad experience me , my husband , and my three teenagers visited this hotel for a long weekend it was nothing short of disappointment after disappointment when we arrived , our rooms were not ready which is nothing really out of the ordinary we were told to leave our bags sit outside near the bellmen ( open air lobby ) we were not comfortable leaving the bags but were not given a choice there was nowhere else to store them so we left them and went to have lunch we found the food to be mediocre at best and mostly everything tasted bland and exactly the same the staff was friendly but many times did not speak english after lunch we were given our room keys i specifically asked not to have rooms with a view of the new construction not only did we end up with one room with a construction view , but two i went back to the front desk to have our rooms changed they offered no help i asked to speak with the concierge who helped me prior to visiting , rafael , and he too said there was nothing they could do i was told one room might open up that we could move to but then our rooms would not be next to each other we stayed put only to see several people checking in to new rooms later that day close to each other the rooms are layed out nice and look nice in pictures but they smell and are dirty there were stains on the couch , the two throw rugs by the bed , the lamp shades , the walls , etc also , get a room as far away from the theatre and main bar we were the seventh room in and were kept up through all hours of the night a lot of partiers head to their rooms around 2:00 / 3:00 a and are happy to scream about their enjoyment the man in the room next to us arrived at his room drunk and making a lot of noise he was arrested around 3:00 a and his wife was escorted out the next morning do not count on the concierge , rafael , for help he booked us a taxi for our roundtrip airport  hotel  airport when we found our driver he escorted us to his taxi in a large parking lot full of nice , clean taxis , we were stuck in a small , very dirty , and run - down taxi the driver spoke no english and did not seem too concerned about us so once we settled in we were excited to go to the beach when we got down there , directly in front of the hotel there is about 15 feet of swimming from the shore there is a safety line you ca not go past because that 's where they let their speed boat renters ride around they told us we could go past the line but might get run over if you wander down the beach to the far side of the resort it opens up much more we took our snorkel gear but no coral and no fish the coral is too far out to swim to they offer free water sports for anything that does not have a motor my daughter wanted to wind surf but was told it was too hard if she had never done it my husband and i wanted to take a catamaran out it was free after you paid the $50 instruction fee the only good thing i can say about the beach is that they had plenty of chairs for everyone it rained all four days we were there so we explored the resort for fun things to do the basketball court is not for basketball - - does not even have a hoop the tennis courts are extremely run down the outdoor ping pong table is warped and hard to play on the pool water is very cold the entertainment at night is almost as good as a high school performance the towel hut only permits one towel per person if your towel is taken or blows away , you pay for it tv stations are poor in the room to get the decent channels , including the weather channel , you have to pay extra personnel in the computer area are rude and unwelcoming board games are in spanish so you ca not play them the list could go on but i 'm sure you get the gist of it 
definitely not 5 star we arrived at the majestic colonial hoping for a relaxing 7 day vacation in a 5 star 2 year old resort what we got was the worst experience we have had so far in 7 consecutive years of caribbean vacations my excited son walked into our musky smelling room and sat on the bed which collapsed one of the feet had broken off and would have had to be evident to the maid the bell boy happened to be delivering our luggage at the time and said he would send someone right down to fix our bed ( never happened ) my husband had to fix it himself by going out into the hallway where another broken bed happened to be outside ( i guess common problem ) and he was able to take a foot from that bed in order to fix the one in our room receptacles were hanging off the wall with live wires exposed the phone smelled like someone had thrown up on it , which is very likely with the food you are served quality of hotel finishes left a lot to be desired and it is hard to believe hotel is only 2 years old the beach is beautiful although you have to be careful in the water as it gets deep pretty quick we never had a problem with chairs at the beach or pool pool is also fantastic although the water is very cold and don?? try going in after 6pm , my son got scolded for doing so the layout of this resort is not well planned lunch buffet at the beach always the same very little selection especially with fruits and desserts need a waiter to order your drinks , no where to be found try walking away from your plate and one will jump out of nowhere to grab your plate  cutlery ( they want you out fast ) dinner at the steakhouse 1st night , appetizers were forgotten so they were served half way through our meal 2nd night we were served drinks in plastic cups which i could not understand when all the other guests were served in glass cups after complaining we were punished by being made to wait for drinks while the waiter walked around looking for something to do finally he brought us hot drinks with a cube of ice after we were well into our meal dinner at the japanese restaurant , nice presentation of sushi to pick from but i don?? believe they know how to refrigerate this food properly because i became extremely sick for the next 2 days and my husband and sons still have diahrea to this day we asked at customer relations desk to dial our signature rep so we could verify our pick - up time to the airport she proceeded to interrogate us as to why we needed to make this call and her conclusion was that we could either wait for our rep to come in later on that afternoon or we could go back to our room and get charged for the call unless she saw blood or we had broken bones she was not going to dial any number for us this conversation lasted about 5min where a simple call would have taken up 1 min of her time and would have pleased a guest she saved the resort $ 50 for the call with the penny pinching attitude that is so evident at this resort i believe she could get promoted for this deed so i left her name out towels are located in an awkward place away from the beach careful when returning towels they will try to give you less cards than the towels you returned so you can get charged for them the entertainment team must come up with new jokes so they do not have to rely on making fun of the chinese language we are not chinese and found this to be extremely insulting the music , ??t?? raining men? will replay all day every day , because they play the same  only cd over and over willing to pay for late check out that is advertised , not possible too many guests arriving that day storage room for luggage after we had to give up our room was not secured in any way , anyone could have gotten into our luggage so had to carry around our passports and valuables at the beach line ups to take a cold shower in the courtesy rooms and one towel for the 3 of us hot water did not run out it just wasn?? connected first time i ever took the time from my busy schedule to write a review and although i could go on with the disappointment of this resort i believe i have gotten my point across so that no one else has to be subjected to this kind of treatment 
lower your expectations if you want to enjoy this resort this is a very difficult review for me to write - my aim here is solely to help those thinking about staying at this resort , in specific , or in punta cana , in general , make an informed decision and , hopefully , have a more pleasant experience ( my apologies in advance for any grammar/typos ) summary : if you are absolutely set on visiting punta cana , the majestic colonial is not a bad place to say as long as you lower your expectations - specifically , you will not be dissapointed if you expect a 2- star start hotel you will be fairly dissapointed if you expect a 3- star resort and , you will be extremely dissapointed if you 're expecting a stay in a 4- star or better resort lastly , i do not recommend you book your stay through an agency unless you receive a significantly lower price than what you would receive through the resort directly i assure you , this is a review from a real person with extensive travel experience feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions or are looking for additional helpful tips the specifics : i stayed at the majestic colonial with my wife and 8 yr old daughter from december 13th through december 24th , 2007 we chose this resort based on reviews we read here initially , my wife was concerned about some of the mixed reviews we read about the resort we chose to dismiss some of the negative reviews since no resort can please everyone and since we had stayed at other all - inclusives in the past and felt our expectations were more realistic punta cana : before you consider this resort town as your destination , i strongly recommend you do some research ( you can get a free and extremely helpful tourist guide to punta cana by sending a request to cpt@codetel punta cana is a somewhat remote resort community - it is located in a very rural area that 's 3 hours away from the capital city of santo domingo and 1 hour away from the closest thing to resemble a rural city the color of the water there is magnificent , the sand is among the nicest you 'll find in the carribean the superlatives stop here - it 's that simple overall , my impression of this community is that is it still trying to define itself and still learning how to present a professional experience for the seasoned tourist though everyone is eager to help and tries to be friendly , it is difficult to find the knowledgeable and experienced help that you 'd expect to find in a supposedly major tourist destination we consistenly heard from guests at various resorts that the overall service level and food quality at puerto plata , dominica republic is vastly superior , although the beaches are not as nice similarly , having stayed at the riviera maya and and cabo san lucas ourselves , we found the overall service levels to be much superior ( i am openly very biased in favor of the mayan riviera - there 's simply considerably more to do there , the resorts are much better , service levels are superior , and the beach and water there are heavenly as well our view of the punta cana resorts was confirmed by several fellow tourists who we met while at various excursions most had stayed at the other upscale resorts in the area ( iberostar , bahia prinicipe , riu , etc ) to a tee , they all confirmed that their stay was not up to par furthermore , we had several locals ( taxi drivers , exursion coordinator who told us the majestic was the best or second best resort in the area i would come back to punta cana again , but i would probably wait at least 3 years to give the area a chance to grow and find itself making our reservation : we booked our stay through cheapcarribean in the past , we always booked directly through the resort/airline/car rantal company etc we went through cheapcarribean because the resort was sold out of units and cheapcarribean had apparently blocked some rooms in hindsight , this was a mistake cheapcarribean , as do most agencies , have very strict cancellation fees at most , you can expect to get a credit , not a refund , toward future travel thru that agency compare that to booking directly with a hotel where usually you do not get charged if you cancel up to 24 hours in advance in this case , we were very dissapointed with the resort after our first few days of stay had we booked directly through the hotel , we would 've simply found another hotel without any financial obligation because we had already paid the full fee to cheapcarribean , we did not have that luxury getting to the resort : the punta cana airport was quaint in a nice way - it is a small airport and it was built to exude carribean style with tatch roofs and open ceilings at the airport , you will be mobbed by workers who want to help you with your luggage i recommend you get one of them to help for a few $ the airport is small , but , it is not necessarily well marked we had purchased transfers directly thru cheapcarribean , but did not have a clear idea where to catch the shuttle the resort : with the reviews we read , and having stayed at other all inclusives ( the riu palace cabo san lucas and cancun , the iberostar maya and barcelo maya both in the mayan riviera mexico ) we expected and paid for ( $580/night on average ) a four star or better resort we also expected a mega - resort comparable to those found in the 4- star category in the mayan riviera to say the least , we were disappointed based on this expectation ( initially , we thought our stay may be better at one of the many adjacent truly mega - resorts - but , as we found out later , this was supposedly one of the top resorts in the area when staying abroad , i tend to be fairly forgiving in many areas i know the employees generally work very hard to please everyone i know the cooks generally try to make the cleanest best food they can i know management generally try to motivate their people as best as possible when it comes to the safety of my family , i am not as forgiving this resort had several areas that were of extreme concern to me : safety : none of the roomc had peep holes or safety chains throughout our stay , we would hear someone knocking at our door and we were not able to safely make sure it was ok to open the door the hotel saw it fit to have maintenance and maid service people knock on our door as late as 10:30pm one night , we even had someone knock at our door around 3am in the morning we did not open the door then obviously i was appalled by the hotel 's lack of courtesy to afford these standard and inexpensive safety features to their guests sanitation : again , this is resort serving thousands of guests and you cannot expect hospital grade sanitation however , i found general sanitation here unacceptable flies and bugs crawling on open food bars - especially the buffet/retaurant facility close to the ocean salads and cold foods served without ice or refrigiration ( there would be ice around the food when it was first served but the ice would not be replenished after it melts not did the equipment supply any refrigiration ) before i would touch any uncooked items ( fruits , salads , etc ) i would bring my hand close to the food to check for temperature and , without exception , everything was always room temperature needless to say , i stopped consuming all salad bar , butter , milk etc period even with that , i constantly experienced mild pain in my stomach ( again , i had never had any symptoms throughout travel in mexico and the carribean ) water : you cannot drink water from the tap here - nor use it to brush your teeth you 'll have to use bottled water for that ( yes , mexico has a similar problem , but four star resorts there filter their water for you ok , get this , all doors to public restrooms are always kept open to the life of me , i just did not get this i closed the doors behind me several times when using the men 's room , and someone would re - open the door i know this cannot be a cultural thing ( my wife and i theorized this must have to do with ventilation/hvac - but were not sure ) though men/women could maintain a decent amount of privacy in most public restrooms , there were some were that was impossible the urinal would be facing an open door - - - - i am sorry , but i found this simply unacceptable when we arrived , we were greeted with a gentleman who offered cold towel service and another waitress offering the majestic special non - alcoholic cocktail the lobby was beautifully appointed and was up to par with our expectations we took the gestures to be a good omen for a pleasant stay boy , were were we wrong the resort was build about two years ago to best summarize the situation there , i believe the resort was built with very poor finish quality ( open tiles , no mouldings on many doors , gaps in ceilings ) the fit an finish in many areas is simply unacceptable for a 3 or 4 star resort 
beware of food i stayed in majestic colonial in january 2007 nearly a year passed but still my food impresions are with me 4 years ago i stayed in melia caribe tropical and although the food there is nothing extraordinary , but still much better than in majestic colonial in majestic colonial the food is ok only for us people : hamburgers , hot - dogs , pseudo - italian pizza and bad coffee - everything they got used to for european guests the hotel food will seem untasty and with limited choice also i do remember dirty , greesy plates in self - service restaurants beware food poisoning 2- days medical check and necessary treatment provided by nice and professional hotel doctor costs u$d400 include medical insurance in your trip if you are planning to go in january , be ready to strong wind and 1-2 times a day heavy rain the hotel is quite new , but quality of the construction works are very - very low but do not worry : they are domenican - very relaxed and therefore easily to kill take a 30- minutes walk along the beach : and visit a nice hotel - riu palace or maybe it is better to visit it in web before purchasing your trip and choose it instead of majestic colonial 
trip was ok , but the staff made it better overall our stay at majestic colonial was just ok the resort was beautiful , but they go cheap on many things like no towels in the bathrooms throughout the resort , pool towels are highly monitored , food was very limited between 10:30 and 12:30, food was similar at many restaurants , you get charged for room service , you only get 2 beers per day in your room , and the unlimited booze doesnt include top shelf i was disappointed in the food compared to other places i have been the selection of seafood was very limited service was below my level of expectations for most except for a few staff members that made our trip very memorable for instance , we checked in and they tried to put us in a lower priced room without telling us since ours wasnt ready yet , they never had change for tipping , our room wasnt cleaned one day , the phone in our room wouldnt dial out without numbers sticking and we got charged for making extra calls because of it , the beds were very hard , and they didnt always change our sheets you mostly have to go get your own drinks when by the pool or ocean , and you have to wait quite a while for drinks when the bars are busy i believe many of these issues are common with the other area resorts as well after talking with other tourists also , the nightly performances were pretty bad when they involved dancing you could tell the dancers were not very experienced michael jackson was ok and the circus night was good once you leave the resort , the area is pretty sketchy i guess it is comparable to jamaica , but maybe a little worse not everything was negative though the entertainment team by the pool was great , especially the men felix at the beach bar was awesome nelson overexceeded our expectations and even gave us dancing lessons , and he is sooo cute if felix , nelson , and the entertainment team would not have been there , our experience would not have been the same pablo at the lower lobby bar was good as well there were lots of families with small children and wedding parties most visitors were from canada or europe 
beautiful beach/water , not a 5 star resort this was our first time to the dominican we have traveled the world and have stayed in all types of accommodations , but prefer the nicer type of resorts we traveled with two teens also front desk check in was a nightmare they did not have our reservations , expedia or they screwed up not even our category of room was available but they made it better 2 1/2 hours later by giving us 2 rooms instead of one suite no welcome drinks were offered , only wet towel resort is very pretty , beaches and water are so beautiful and clean people at the resort were nice but not overly friendly they were constantly painting and keeping the resort clean and spiffy speaking spanish is a must not much english understood the food was abundant but not great standout were fresh fruit , anything made to order , salads , breads and desserts the largest dining room for all meals is dark service was good and bad daily - no consistency gourmet restaurant food was o , service horrible and slow japanese food was barely edible , service was good steak and seafood restaurants were the best with good service of some of the best food we had all week , just not that great dominican restaurant we did not touch - looked awful we are not big drinkers and drinks were o , in small cups , so bring your own insulated mug if you wish by the way , we are tippers and tipped constantly did it improve our service overall - no entertainment was too late , inappropriate for younger kids , stupid when it came to the guests and only a few shows were watchable they do try hard no , no time soon to this island too many other places we 've been in mexico , caribbean ( aruba is fantastic ) would be our next choice again oh yeah , my one teen got very sick the 2nd day and we all felt gastro problems on the last day - something is not right in their food or water/ice just go there with your eyes open , with some info from recent travelers and you should be fine 
at all we went to the majestic for my brothers wedding apart from the wedding the trip was a bust 36 people went and more than half of us got sick and stayed sick the entire time ( we named it dr butt ) in fact , i have been home a week and my intestines are still cramping aside from the medicore food and the cheap liquor , we were ripped off by hotel staff members here 's the scam if you go to the tour desk before there are tour operators are there ( before 9:00 am ) a hotel staff member complete with ( picture ) id , receipt book and guest list and uniform will approach you about an excursion and take your deposit , even tell you where to wait and give you a receipt when you go to the tour desk to ask what 's taking so long you show your receipt , they tell you majestic does not book excursions juan took our deposit for 6 people ( one of them the groom ) the hotel did not reimburse us , nor did they put us on another tour in fact , i felt , put them blame on us after hours of arguing , we asked that they call the police , they refused when i asked them how to dial the police myself , they would not tell me either i found out later it is 911 ( just an fyi ) aside from that , if you bring your lap top , be advised that hotel staff can and will hack into it and view the information you are viewing too ( as they did my nephew 's banking info ) then there is the casino you really need to know the game you are playing , how much you are betting and how much you would win casino dealers will pay you incorrectly , take your money when you win and then say , no comprende we did get them to rewind the tape and pay us correctly , once the majestic really made an impression on us their refusal to help us ( their guests , who brought 30 other people ) leads us to believe these incidents are not isolated they know it goes on and they do not care if you go be very cautious you can jimmy the in room safes open very easily do not be lured into a false sense of security 
3 late 20s/early 30s couples take our annual trip - this time with +s and - s the group : 3 close couples ranging in ages from mid 20s to early 30s who travel together annually the time : november 3rd -7th ( we left earlier than the other 2 couples because of work ) reviews : - check - in : was a cluster we arrived and were happy to bump into one of the other couples we were meeting in punta cana it came out that they were not able to check in as they did not have a printed voucher which ended up being a copy of their emailed itinerary they literally had to go over to guest services and log into email to get the print out and bring it back - hello , technology since when ca not you check into a hotel with the credit card you used to make the reservation at most with a picture id there were a bunch of other people going through this check - in hell and the cold clothes and no liquor drinks were not enough to make anyone happy we were lucky to have this print out but when we checked in they had no rooms available and it was 3:00pm and we had been up since 3:00am our check - in attendant was less than helpful , would not listen , and we finally had to demand a room and were promptly placed next to the construction ( which we never heard so no big deal ) - rooms : the rooms are beautiful , spacious , and well kept we were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and a stocked mini fridge which was nice extra shower towels would have been fantastic but were delivered upon request the in - room safe was great , especially considering i was nervous about leaving important things in the room the shower was spacious and jacuzzi tub in the room was a nice touch the bed was like lying on a tiled floor and the pillows were marginal but we made do service : you found some , you did not we met 2-4 really great people at the majestic pablo and jose were excellent to us and remembered us - many of the bartenders were smiles and fun , always taking the time to talk to us and interact the staff at the restaurants leave a lot to be desired i 've never seen such poor attitudes and bad customer service the front desk staff , as indicated above , were subpar , with the exception of rafael who coordinated transportation for us via our blackberry the day of our arrival maybe it 's the culture , but it seemed more often than not that we as guests were bothering the staff the spa ladies were superb , however - food : below average i was shocked at how the food was , especially after reading so many positive reviews maybe i come from a location where the food is way beyond average and have traveled to other islands with phenomenal food but this was probably the largest disappointment after a day or so , we were able to navigate and remember what was good and what was bad and so it seemingly got better the food at le gourmet was good , with french influence but not french cuisine the food at the japanese place was good , but this was our most horrific experience of customer service so that was a bit shadowed suggestion : get reservations immediately upon check - in for these two restaurants as we were not able to do the japanese hibatchi portion of the japanese restaurant taino was a decent mexican/dominican buffet and the breakfast was pretty good ( aside from the rubbery french toast and pancakes ) i suggest lunch at the main buffet as the one on the beach rarely changes and is not all that good also , the buffets are even strict on attire , so it was somewhat frustrating to not be able to walk off the beach/pool and get lunch without changing into clothes also , there is no 24 hour access to food - this was disappointing as sometimes between meals you want a quick snack ( especially when drinking ) and it was not there beach/pool : phenomenal i have been all over and this beach was one of the best beaches i 've been to and it 's the best pool i 've ever been to the ocean is like being in a wave pool - a ton of fun for boogie boarding there are ample amounts of chairs and huts which is excellent i suggest taking advantage of the massage on the beach as it was so relaxing and beautiful the pool is so clean and has lots of neat spots with jacuzzis , ledges to sit on , a swim - up bar , etc again , plenty of chairs and huts overall : pretty good it 's a shame that the check - in experience , poor customer service , and so - so food brought my experience expectations lower than before arrival because this resort is absolutely beautiful the grounds are well kept , extremely tropical and pretty , clean and full of life the michael jackson show was a blast and many of the bartenders were charismatic and a lot of fun to be around the rooms were pretty , the beach and pool some of the best i 've seen i think the majestic can easily improve upon some of the things i 've listed and it will truly attract return visitors not unless someone gets married there ( which they pump out multiple weddings a day - crazy ) or the group decides to return i think there are better places in the carribean and look forward to experiencing them - however the colonial was a great time , excellent experience and i encourage others to visit with the understanding of some of the shortcomings i 've identified 
shame we did not get a 5 rating experience we have just returned from the majestic punta cana but after reading all the 5 star reviews i am sad to say that we must have been unlucky and missed what they experienced do not get me wrong it was a really nice place and we had a great holiday but unfortunately there were a few things that let it down first of all on arrival we booked in and were told that they did not have any information booklets in english and had to make do with french might as well have been in klingon for all the sense that made only a small thing i agree and we did manage to get one in english later in the week but by that time we had found out most things ourselves anyway the room was fantastic with jacuzzi , huge comfy bed , tv and mini - bar etc however , be warned i would seriously advise people that if they are allocated room 3144 that they decline and ask for another that is unless you are an early bird who likes to get up at the crack of dawn to see sun - rises etc now me , i have to suffer being woken up really early by an alarm for work everyday so when i go on holiday i want to be able to lie in if i wish and wake up naturally feeling refreshed and ready for the day but what did room 3144 give us it is positioned right next to some sort of store room or cleaners room so every day at around 7am we would be woken by the sounds of banging and cleaners shouting and screaming to each other right outside our room and it would continue for almost an hour talk about stressful despite a visit to reception where we were told there was nothing they could do and despite going out to politely ask them to be quieter it still happened every single day we 'd then get back to sleep to then be woken up at 9am by the mini - bar guy banging on the door and if you did not let him in you did not get your mini - bar filled at all that day it was such a shame as all that noise really could have ruined a great holiday the staff at the dive centre are great the diving is not the best in the world but the enthusiasm of the staff makes up for that especially bernardo who will admit himself he is the best diver in the world one rather important thing to mention is the mini - market do not forget anything as you will need to take out a second mortgage to buy anything from there a bag of crisps was $8 and for a small deodorant they tried to charge $47 do not forget a mosquito plug in like we did or you 'll be a very tasty meal i would certainly reccommend this hotel it was well worth going although it was more like a one week holiday repeated rather than a two week holiday as all the entertainment and shows the second week were exactly the same as the first week just a shame about the cleaning staff 
not what i was expecting at all this was my first and last trip to punta cana and the majestic hotel before my fianc?e and i decided on this hotel we read many reviews that stated that this was the best hotel in the dr and that it was a 5 star hotel all i can say is that if this is a 5 star in the dominican republic i am scared to go to anything less in this country my fianc?e and i are pretty well traveled and we have stayed in everything from trucker stops along the i -95 to 5 star hotels in the turks and caicos and 2 stars in the bahamas so i would like to think that we have a pretty good idea as to what to expect from a hotel that claims itself to be a 5 as a couple that spends most of our vacation time in motels and howard johnsons and the odd marriott and doing local trips to save money , we splurge a little on a vacation about once every 2 years and pamper ourselves so we know what we are expecting from a 5 star hotel , and the majestic is definitely not that to make it easier i am going to break this into different sections as there is allot to tell appearance : i will give the hotel the just respect it deserves as allot of energy was put into maintaining the grounds and the appearance of the hotel by the management and the staff the grounds were very scenic with a great beach and a nice pool , even though it was all about 4ft deep with no deeper sections the airportfrom the moment we arrived in the dr it felt like we were getting hustled when you land be prepared to pay $20 per person just to enter the country after collecting our bags and clearing customs we had to fight our way through the hoards of aggressive taxi drivers and bus boys and baggage handlers that were adamant on taking your bags and convincing you that taking a taxi was the better way check inwe finally got to the hotel at about 2pm after arriving at 11:30am , as predicted from other reviews our room was not ready we waited around until about 4:30 before getting a little edgy as we were still in our jeans and socks ( travel cloths ) and were quite hot and bothered after sweating , so we asked to be let into our room just so that we could change into cooler outfits after being reluctantly being allowed into a room to get changed and securing our passports at about 5pm we made our way to the bar and started to finally start our holiday the rooma little later when we decided to get changed to go to dinner we returned to a finally finished room that looked lovely , with a hudge bath and a luxurious king sized 4 poster bed i decided to jump belly first into the bed out of excitement and almost broke my arm ( no exaggeration , my arm still hurts and that happened 6 days ago ) i have never felt a bed so hard in my life and i was in the navy for 6 years the mattress was about 3 inches thick and coated in some kind of vinyl (5 star hotels generally have nice beds ) the pillows were made of foam and the sheets were like sand paper on our freshly sunned skin i have never slept so badly in my life the rooms on the bottom floors had their jacuzzis outside , who is going to take a bath with everyone watching i didn?? see anyone using them the whole time we were thereroom servicei advise that anyone that goes here to lock up everything one evening my fianc?e went to put on her deodorant and when she opened the top there was a big black hair on it and she gets her armpits waxed ? of her lotion was used and her shoes tried on all of this from a hotel that claims themselves to be 5 star after reporting this to a manager on our second day the maids gave us terrible service we had to actively ask for fresh towels and even get fresh toilet roll after having food poisoning foodi myself am from a caribbean country and i come to expect the culinary quirks that the region offers , from over seasoned meats , to orange juice drink instead of orange juice , but both my fianc?e and i got food poisoning on our third day from the japanese restaurant and were sick for the remainder of the vacation the buffet meals were ok , but there was little to no variation in the selection that they offered , and by the second day we were pretty much eating the same thing over and over and over on another of the nights we ventured to the steak house where we got an ok steak with rotten vegetables , yes rotten we could see where the cauliflower heads had been shaved to cut the mold off marketif you see a market in the hotel by the stage area , avoid it like the clapp , we saw it and thought that it was a cute idea , but the people at the stalls were very very very very aggressive and they swarmed you like a hoard , all of them telling you their pity stories and grabbing your arm to drag you to their stall? even though they all were selling the same low quality stuff well i am not going to go on , but all i can say is watch your change , take imodium with you , put all of your stuff in the safe and don?? go unless its your only option 
problem with the ensuite bathrooms my boyfriend and i stayed in at the majestic colonial for the last week of july 2007 the main and number one problem with the place is the washrooms in the hotel rooms there really is not a seperate washroom at all becasue the washroom is completely open to the main room where the bed is there are stall like doors in front of the toilet and shower but no real privacy this was a problem when wanting to use the toilet basically every sqeak squak and toot is echoed through the room is full living colour my boyfriend and i would take turns stepping out of the room so the other person could use the toilet this became a problem after the first 48 hours because we both had upset stomaches from the food and often had use the toilet urgently i am used to having a full door on the washroom so that i can have a small amount of privacy to take care of personal things the toilet problem really sucked because we found it make us uncomfortable as for the beach it was beautiful and there was always a place to sit the bar and food were good but by no means great the hotel is pretty and there are good live shows in the evenings again , the bathroom thing spoiled it really 
not meet our expectations we ( group of 28 people ) travel last week to majestic colonial for 8 days and the expectations of the hotel changed complettly first when the group arrived ( 4 of us were older 80 years old ) and their rooms were so far away that they practically stay in their rooms for the whole trip , the rest of us were scatter throughout the hotel the rooms were nice but there were never enough towels and went you went to your room at 3pm the room was not made yet the small refrigeretor in the room never had regular drinks , everything was diet when you ask to the reception for beverages , towels or pillows they never arrived on the carabelas seafood restaurant the service was horrible specially a waiter named nerido , he is supervisor of the restaurant and he did not want to sit our whole group together or close , we had to talk with the general manager who inmidiately resolve the problem , this guy was disrecpectfull the whole night and the next day he and his staff stop a member of the group in the exit of the pm buffet next to the beach with food for a little girl of 2 years because you can t take carry out food from the restaurant , but if you call the room service they never send your food and they will charge you a fee for it the beach had no bar and if you want a refresment drink only one employee serving for hundred of people on the beach practically no watersports equipment on the beach the better place for sodas and drinks are in the pool bar , the food was great some employees are excelent the pool is great and enormous 
had higher expectaions , but ok trip my boyfriend and i visited the majestic colonial from july 6- july 13, 2007 overall , it was a good trip , but i think all the reviews are a little exaggerated and slightly misleading about how great this place its neither one of us had ever been to an all - inclusive resort before , nor had we ever been to the dominican republic i must say , first of all , that the resort/beach is beautiful - - we loved the location , the resort grounds , etc - - we had perfect , blue sky weather everyday ( got really lucky on this ) and for the most part , thought the room was very nice ( we upgraded to the direct pool access room which i would highly recommend - - it was very convenient to be able to walk out your door to the pool ) there was a slight bug issue in the room ( lots of small , ant - like bugs on the furniture ( especially desk and nightstands ) , but i guess what can you expect - - it is a tropical climate , etc i would strongly advise reading as much as you can about the resort/what it has to offer/etc , because the rooms have no guides/information about the resort ( ie - no info about the restaurants/hours of operation/menus , etc/no instructions on how to use the phones even this was fairly frustrating , but thankfully i had done a lot of research prior to coming and knew , somewhat , what to expect we did have some issues with the phone that were frustrating i had purchased an international calling card ( which i do not recommend ) prior to leaving home and intended on using this rather than our cell phones ( which did work , but cost 2 00/min to use while there ) 00 connection fee anytime you use the hotel phone and you have to dial 0 to get the operator to dial the number for you i tried 3 times to get the calling card to work , it never did , and was told that we would not be charged as no call was actually made - - we ended up just using our cell phones - - upon check out , we were charged and told that it did not matter what we had been told and had to pay for these calls - - this was frustrating - - we also spoke with others at the resort that said their calling cards would not work either - - not sure what the problem was my biggest complaint was the food - - in my opinion it was terrible - - i am a slightly picky eater , but my boyfriend is not at all and we both had a lot of trouble finding things that tasted ok there is certainly no lack of selection , everythinig just tasted strange and was very greasy - - especially the breakfast my best recommendation would be the french restaurant , le gourmet - - we ate there twice and i got the pumpkin cream soup and surf and turf both times and this was my favorite meal by far i was very disappointed w/ the japanese steakhouse matsuri and the buffett - - the beach steakhouse was ok , but definitely not good i would strongly recommend bringing snacks - - towards the end of the trip , i could not take the food anymore and bought a small/med bag of doritos from the gift shop that cost 7 i ate that for 2 meals i would also strongly recommend bring pepto bismol - - we used all 24 tablets of ours - - we did not drink the tap water and never got sick , but had upset stomachs several days and assume the food had a lot to do with it as far as activities go , i did the pool - water aerobics almost everyday - - would recommend , and we took the isla saona trip , a little long , but would also recommend ( we were gone from 6:30am till 7:30 pm and it cost approx 85 00/ea ) - - it 's really interesting to drive through the cities and the island is beautiful overall , we had a good time , probably would not return , but if we did would definitely plan no more than a 5 day stay - -8 was a little too much 
does not live up to the hype i was more than a bit disappointed with some aspects of the majestic colonial the good - - the beach was beautiful and huts were always available and the entire staff was helpful , friendly and accommodating there was no information on anything at all in the room it would have been helpful to know the dress code for the restaurants and what type of restaurants there were i did not know there was an italian restaurant until i got home we were alwaysdressed wrong for every restaurant and had to go back to the room to change food was ok , nothing more breakfast and lunch buffets were boring same thing every day no room service , no washclothes , no tissues , no bathrobes , nothing to put in the jacuzzi tub , mini bar was only stocked with two beers and a couple of sodas , pillows were awful , beds were not much better and towels were like sandpaper ripped , dirty slip cover on couch in room all the cushions inthe lobby were so stained and filthy i would not sit on them not at all worth the price 
avoid colonial majestic large group of us agreed on the following about majestic 1 air conditioning works very poorly in this hotel get ready for sweating while you sleep2 bar staff were very slow long waits dont belong on vacation some were fast , but slow service was unavoidable3 catamarian trip overpriced and one and a half hours ride while bus goes to 9 other hotels instead , get a cab directly there - 10 minute ride to dock no need for advance reservation , either this is the shark snorkling trip4 not nearly enough staff to handle bookings for excursions again , get ready for long slow lines5 refridgerators dont work well at this hotel contents are usually almost room temp - bad for baby bottles or beernot worth the $ savings , unless you deal well with hot rooms too many others in punta 
not as good as it sounds we arrive on saturday june 16, 2007 a family of 9 i must say that we were not impress with this hotel or it?? hospitality , this place is overrated and not what i was expecting , me being a returning vacationer in punta cana was disappointed with the food the activities and the hospitality the casino and the staff , so far i think that the ivero star is not as nice as the majestic but it beats the majestic in every other category , this hotel should be rated 3 stars not 5? rc and family 
food poisoning on my 3rd day i stayed at majestic colonial in 2006, but never had a chance to share my views i seen good reviews for it then and good ones now , and i have no idea why my experience : food : horrible i got food poisoning on my 3rd day there , and my stomach is not sensitive at all , i usually never get this had diarrhea all night and day , until i could not take it anymore and went to see the resort 's medical staff i was charged around $200 to get anti - diarheal shots and pills resort would not pay for this service : below average , it felt like they are doing you a favor when you call them hotel : above average rooms were beautiful in general , i am shocked by the ratings on this place makes me wonder how to compare to other ratings 
completely overrated - nyc , ny was very disappointed with this hotel , i basically booked based on reviews here , which i 've done in the past , but i found them off the mark this time punta cana beaches are beautiful  easy to get to from nyc , so we 'll be back , but would not stay here again we stayed at the sol melia a few years back  it was much nicer overall , the place was showing some serious wear  tear we got stuck in the elevator one night , the landscaping was shoddy , the pool was looking dingy /dirty around the edges , etc the rooms were nice , although the couch in ours was disgusting , i would not sit on it the food was beyond terrible i 've eaten at some bad buffets , but this was the worst i 've ever seen the salad bar was tiny , and who wants to eat hot pasta when it 's 95 degrees out the dominican restaurant was the best out of the lot , but not great do not bother ordering wine ( a la carte ) , they must not keep it correctly because the 2 times we tried it , it was terrible the plus is that we always found a shady spot at the pool  there were plenty of spots at the beach , which is really what mattered to us after walking down the beach  checking out other places ( and staying at the sol melia in the past ) , we know that there are much nicer spots in punta cana do not waste your time on this one 
food stinks we recently returned for an anniversary trip and were somewhat disappointed with the majestic this is hardly a 5 star hotel the service is adequate but not very helpful or friendly the room is nice but freezing cold air conditioning and very musty the food was the biggest disappointment the salad bar was terrible the fruit did not even taste as fresh as other caribean islands most choices were greasy or fried the steak house and the japanese were good my husband got very ill after eating at the gourmet the drinks are mostly all premade which stinks overall this place is alright but i would certainly have lower expectations compared to previous reviews the pool and beach are excellent but would not return 
some + 's , some - 's my husband and i went for our 1 year anniversary to the majestic colonial from 5/28 to 6/1 there were definitely some pluses and minuses from this vacation we arrived at the punta cana airport and took a taxi ride to the resort i was told this was better than taking a shuttle , as the shuttle has multiple stops before majestic and could take up to an hour to arrive at the hotel there is no line at the airport for the taxi ride , and it takes about 30-35 mins cost is $35 us dollars when arriving at the resort , we were given cool towels but no drinks i read some people got cold drinks as they arrived but we did not we got to the reception desk to check - in and we were helped by jenny who normally works at guest services , but was filling in at the check - in counter she put the gray bracelets on for us and told us room service was included with these bracelet due to this , we ordered room service all week and found out at check - out that this was false information i 'll get to the details of this later we get to our room and got 2 double beds instead of 1 king size bed we called the front desk and they told us they will call us back in 5 mins we waited in the room for their callback for 15 mins before calling them back they put us on hold and told us they are switching our room and the bellhop will come by and take us to our new room it took them 30 mins to finally come and take us we wasted so much time on getting the room situation straightened out i was not pleased rooms : the bathrooms have no privacy unless you 're 100% comfortable with the people you are staying with , do not share a room since it was only my husband , i did not care , but the toilet area is very small with no lock on doors and no privacy to toilet or shower also , we saw little ant - like insects crawling around our sinks all week i think i killed about a hundred of them during our stay food : we tried making reservations at matsuri but was told they are all booked during our stay they suggested us going there early and taking places of people that do not show up for their reservation luckily , we were able to do that and the food was great steakhouse was really good , chinese was good , the buffet was super overall , the food was wonderful we really enjoyed every restaurant there , but we are not pick eaters beaches and pool : beautiful there was never any problems getting chairs at either places we got unlucky with the weather as it was only sunny for a few hours early in the day , then rained most of the afternoons and nights shows : the shows we saw were - ideal couple , circus show , mr majestic and the magic show all shows were entertaining in a cheesy kind of way i enjoyed it more than my husband did oh , and also , we got tons of bug bites while watching the shows make sure you take bug spray if you go service : we encountered some really good service and some really poor service some bartenders were really nice and some just did not seem to care we still tipped $1 for every drink take plenty of $1 bills for tips we tipped normally $1 per drink and $2 - $5 per meals most people do not tip but we could not help it , they do work hard casino : i normally play blackjack but there were only 3 blackjack tables do not expect too much from the casino , it 's very small with limited seats if you go late at night we always stopped by after the nightly shows and it got pretty crowded also , i 'm not sure if the dealers do this on purpose or not , but they mess up a lot you have to watch them carefully , as i caught them several times messing up on our pay we did not do any excursions because of the bad weather it basically rained most of the days we were there , except for the first and last day boo : - ( check - out : we got into a heated argument with the hotel management and because of this incident , i will never go back to majestic again during our check - in , jenny ( who normally works at guest services ) told us room - service was included with our all - inclusive package as she was putting the supreme gray bracelet on us , she told us that that was the highest level bracelet and that all room service was included because of this my husband and i decided to take advantage and order room service during the rainy afternoons when we were checking - out , we were told that the room service was not included with the gray bracelet and we owed over $100 us dollars i spoke to 2 different supervisors there ( francisco and victor ) who both told us that we should 've double checked and told us we had to pay up i told them jenny told us room service was included , and they 're response was there is no jenny that works here there is 1 jenny at guest services we tried telling them that was the correct jenny that helped us check - in , but they did not do anything about it they looked at us like we were liars they did not seem to care and did not even try to handle the situation correctly by getting jenny to come over and talk to us so , i had to walk all the way to guest services myself and bring jenny back they basically told us that jenny did not know the correct rules and told us false information , but that it was our responsibily to double check we were furious , and about 30 mins of arguing with them we noticed lines starting to form behind us ( usual check - out time ) they finally decide to credit us the money but they were not happy with it i feel like the only reason they decided to credit us the amount was because they did not want us to make a scene in front of other guest our stay at the majestic colonial was just ok but we left with a lot of anger i was furious at how they treated us while we were checking - out it 's funny how one incident can totally change your mind about the place 
not so relaxing vacation i stayed at the majestic for 5 days , and like everyone else i chose this resort because of it 's review let me start with the good the grounds are beautiful , the staff ( not including management ) are amazing the rooms are also great now the bad our room key did not work on 3 occasions , due to no battery luckily there was a maintanece man who broke into our room and almost broke his neck that cost us a 10 dollar tip after a long night at the disco no one wants to wait in front of thier room for 30 minutes in the heat at 3 am mangement should of had the problem fixed when we first complained instead of giving us keys that did not work this problem was brought to the attention of the public relations desk and they simply said these things happen our room then got flooded due to the rain coming in to through the bottom of the door , some of our things were near the door and where ruined went to the front desk hoping that they at least would offer to wash the cloths that were soiled they simply said they are working on making the problem better that obviously did not help my situation lastly we made reservations to the french restaurant , which men must wear pants to i called public relations to ask if nice shorts were ok for men since the pants were runied in the flood and they said sure needless to say we get to the restaurant and we are not allowed in , i call the public relations person and they apologized for giving me the wrong information they failed to ask me if i was inquiring about men or women dress codes the manager also insulted us by suggesting that we eat next door at this point i was fuming i had my cloths runied and was humiliated at a restaurant they tried to make up for it with a fruit plate the day i left sorry , but that ai not gonna cutting it it is a shame that the management relies on the staff to make the stay pleasent , mangement ( laura especially from the pr desk and victor from reception ) takes no responsibilty for what went wrong if you want to get treated with any type of respect stay away from this place i left feelig like my money was wasted , regardless if the grounds were nice the food and higher up were a waste of my energy i also feel very bad for the staff because they make no money and work so hard , it 's pretty depresssing if you do go to the magestic just hope that you do not have any minor issues , because no one will care 
team animacion this hotel would be perfect for couples and people who are trying to rekindle their marriage as a 21 year old single woman i was a bit bored at times but that changed due to the great people that they have on staff these people were always seen on the beach in the morning , at the pool in the evenings and at the shows and bar at night they dance with you , converse with you and are very pleasant to be around their names are : nelson , kiko , ray and sandy i want tosay thank you to these people in particular for making my stay a pleasant one their outgoing nature and abiliy to make me laugh was priceless i hope that they are rewarded for the work that they do 
i stayed at the majestic colonial for a girl 's weekend trip in may i have to say the service we received there was less than desireable it took us over an hour to check - in once we finally received our room key and open the door , a man was coming out of the shower my girlfirend trekked back to reception ( and she speaks spanish fluently ) only to wait another 30 minutes to speak to someone about the room being occupied and only then to argue with him for another 20 because he did not believe her when she said the room was already occupied the fella who helped us with the luggage stayed with us because he thought it would only take a few minutes for the my girlfirend to get another room , but after waiting for 45 mins he went down to reception to see what was going on it was only after he went down and told the front desk that the room was occupied did we get another room once everything was done it took almost 2 1/2 hours to check in if that was not enough , my luggage was ransacked and money was stolen out of my suitcase it was buried so deep in my belongings ( i took enough clothes and shoes for a month ) that just before i discovered the theft we noticed that the room was not cleaned properly no fresh towels or wash cloths the sink was not cleaned , floor was not swept , the bed was barely made no doubt , because our belongings were being searched when the room was supposed to be cleaned to make a very long story short , my girlfriend called the front desk to speak with the hotel manager , and after being passed around from person - to - person like a joint , she finally got someone and when she asked who it was that she was speaking with , the person had the audacity to say daddy yankeee needless to say we were not in the least pleased it took over 6 hours to get some sort of resolution - - after to talking to 1/2 dozen people in the 5th hour of this ordeal , i was offered an upgrade on a room the next time i stayed there as if i would go back to a place where my belongings were stolen in the 6th hour , just before i was ready to leave , they finally agreed to pay for my spa treatment oh , by the way for those of you that were wondering the safe was broken i love the dominican republic , i go often however , i will never stay at that hotel ever again 
very disappointing we recently spent 10 nights ( feb 20- mar 2) at the majestic colonial resort our travel agent warned us but we looked at the reviews on this website and were misled this is the list of the problems that we unfortunately encountered during our stay : - arrived at the resort on feb 20 and my wife became ill the next evening after arriving , accidentally messing up the room with vomit and we called housekeeping for room cleaning service , was promised to clean up soon , but housekeeping never show up on that the room was not cleaned until the next day - housekeeping frequently used a single full - size sheet to make the king - size bed because the full size sheet was so much shorter than the king - size bed itself , there was about a foot of the mattress exposed without any sheet some days there were two bottom sheets to fully cover the bed other days just one leaving the mattress partially uncovered another result of housekeeping trying to use a single full - size sheet to cover the mattress was that by morning the sheet would be fully un - tucked from the mattress - resort has no mattress pads for the bed which made us feel so uncomfortable without it - not enough towels and shampoo , body gel housekeeping was very inconsistent in replacing these critical bath items - the 2 glasses provided for mouth rising laying up side down on sink counter were not changed daily after use a few times they were noticeably dirty - noisy toilet running water none stop from time to time by itself , and we had to stop it by shaking the handle in order for it to stop - shower door would not close completely you had to be careful to keep the entire bathroom floor from getting all wet and becoming very slippery to walk on - room did not get clean on wed , feb , 28, so no available clean towels for that day we had to go down the hall to get towels from the maid 's cart , and were promised by her for the room to be cleaned later that day , but room did not get cleaned - because the room had very limited supply of toiletry and did not get clean the day before , so there was not a supply of toilet paper , we totally out of toilet paper again we had to chase down the maid for a roll of toilet paper after using the last available paper in the room - my husband had a gross experience sharing real cloth hand towels in public bathroom of the gourmet restaurant with hundreds of other men in the resort he ended up having diarrhea the next day too so we were not sure because of this dirt public hand towel or the food or could possibly both - shortage of electric power at least half dozen times for few minutes every time it was out while we were there for the 10 nights ( had to eat in the dark or whatever we were doing ) also , every time the power went out the a/c had to be reset so if we were not in the room at the time it became very stuffy and smelled damped - light was so dim in the room , so neither my husband or i could easily read our bibles and we had to wait for brighter sunlight up in the morning , so we could stick our bibles in standing position by the patio door to read every morning - sometimes we could watch cnn or movies , and sometimes we could not watch it at all as a notice popped up covering the tv screen for an unpaid bill for satellite service - low quality food being used for guests such as broccoli was not fresh and often looked being cut off on tips of flowers and it looked more yellow than green - i ordered 2 appetizers in chinese without planning to have any dessert or soup , so i could have enough food to eat , and was questioned by the waiter because he tried to stop me from ordering 2 appetizers the waiter insisted that we order 1 appetizer , 1 soup , 1 entr?e and 1 dessert for this reason , we felt we could not freely eat as much as we like or whatever we liked , even though it is supposed to be an all inclusive resort any deviation from the normal menu ( extra appetizer , extra entree or no soup ) threw the service completely off resulting in longer than normal waits or failure to serve what was ordered - we did not have enough bottle water in our room , so we decided to get more from the bar to bring back to our room for the evening , but when the maid saw more than 4 bottles of water in the room the next day , she never stock us anymore than 4 for us as we needed we had to hide them from her in order for her to stock more for our consumption even though water was all we drank , but hardly anything else other than all these problems that we had , one thing we appreciated the most was the entertainment it was really good and funny best of all the animation staff started everything very punctual on the program they provided and not changing the program either like other resorts often do so it seemed more guests participated in it and it was more fun that 's we appreciated and enjoyed a lot so this became the best part of our trip as you see with this negative experience that we had during the 10 nights we were in majestic colonial resort , we felt that the resort did not provide an adequate service the way it should to reflect as 4 5 stars resort that we were promised with such as clean room and good food and drinks , tv service that we paid for i would rate it closer to 2 
okay with some issues my husband and i just got back from a 10 day stay at majestic from may 3-12 i will start by saying that resort grounds are well maintained and that the pool and beach are amazing the food was average if that the buffets are pretty standard but offer the same food pretty much daily my husband and i found the hibacchi to be the best meal of all and the nicest service the only other a la carte that we enjoyed was the steak house the seafood was horrible breakfast each morning was nice , you can get just about anything that you want the standard suite does not include room service and i mention this because on the third night that we were at the resort i was ill and unable to go to dinner my husband went to the italian buffet and asked if would be able to bring me back a piece of bread as i was unable to make it through a meal and he was told no more than once they instead told him to order room service we both found this interesting because each time that we were at that restaurant we noticed people taking plate fulls of food right out without being stopped i was a little put off after that fact considering the price that we paid and every other place that i have gone that was all inclusive didnt care if you took food out i was very upset and told my husband that i was going to search out majestic mike , whom i had read so much about until my husband told me that he believes that mike was one that told him that he couldnt bring any bread to me rooms were spacious and i loved the balcony we were given a lovely room that overlooked the pool and had a small ocean view only problem was the amount of bugs ( i would have expected this if i had brought food back to the room and let it set out ) there were tons of ants and spiders some is to be expected given the climate but it was a little over the top not a good thing for a husband with a terrible fear of ants , especially when they are in the bed at night the bed was a nice king size , i enjoy a hard mattress and it was that , i think it may have been two mats put together because from my husbands side to mine there was a definite dip that started right in the middle there were plenty of pillows so that can help make up for the hard bed if you dont care for one the only thing the pillows dont make up for is the sheets that dont seem to fit the bed and always came up , this meant by morning i was sleeping on the plastic cover ( ) that was over the mattress itself i felt like a toddler who might urinate the bed the air never got cold and we had three lights out in the room the balcony light sometimes went off at night and sometimes didnt making up for the lack of light inside but killing a good nights rest i didnt mind the open concept the toilet stall does have a door on it that gives visual privacy but yes you can hear things if your a couple , your bound to hear those things eventually though right , lol entertainment staff , was great , there was always something to do there were days that we didnt want to do anything and there was plenty of space for that we always seemed to find a spot in the shade no matter what time of day and the hotel was sold out during our visit beach was awesome sand reminds me of bermuda we rented snorkeling gear thats included with the stay they dont give flippers unless you pay for a snorkeling excursion which we happened to do we had a blast on this trip , it was two hours and probably the best part of our trip the one day we walked way down the beach and saw a cop with an automatic weapon escorting locals off the beach , this is not unusual of the caribbean in my opinion make sure you pack everything that you will need i forgot our tums and we got a small bottle at the minimarket and it was $10 us everything is very expensive , the one day we were buying a photo that was taken of us i overheard a couple asking to purchase a disposable camera , it was $45 us needless to say they left without making a purchase we only bought gifts when the vendors were all set up along caribbean street , your able to talk them down a little but i would have consider the prices we got to be a bargain by any means we got a painting for $45 us after we bought it the girl said she was wrapping it up for us well she took it completely off the frame and handed me a rolled up canvas i noticed that everyone else was given the painting the way that it was for sale , including a frame that the picture was mounted on oh well , she was nice enough and im sure they work hard for their money so i didnt say anything i guess they list this place as a five star , i would not agree with that rating i think this would be a great place for families or spring breakers but not someone who is looking for luxury and great food staff , some were great some could have cared less it was busy when we were there and sometimes when you asked for things there were never given to you we tipped everyone , regardless of their niceness i have read how little the employees make and that leaves a spot in my heart we noticed that some of the male employees approaced the females and had dates to go out with them later in the evening , so any single women looking for a how stella got her groove back type affair , im sure you can find it at majestic now some stuff that i didnt use to evaulate my opinion of this hotel but things that i would have liked to know before going to the dr its a very poor country , lots of run down places that you pass on the way to the hotel there doesnt seem to be the happy atmosphere that you get throughout the caribbean the scenery lacks greatly not many flowers or things along that line be advised the airport is a nightmare to fly home from we were flying first class usair and there was only two sets of people in front of us , we waited over 30 minutes because people would come up behind us flag someone down with a $20 and get taken before us now mind you , the entire time we were waiting they were yelling for people in the coach line to come to the front if there were flying to philadelphia i finally went right to the front and just told them to get my ticket printed that i wasnt going to watch anyone pay their way to the front of the line im not sure why but our transfer picked us up at 12:30 ( originally we were told 12:00) and we didnt get to the airport until about 1:45, our flight was leaving at 3 after all was said and done , this was probably the worst vacation that we have ever gone on from start to finish all of this is just the opinion of someone who has traveled greatly and was expecting something classier this is a perfectly suitable resort for plenty and if it were not located in dr , i would go back on a budget friendly trip but i guess its like the line if it seems to good to be true , it is 
less than expected experience my family ( sons ages 11 and 9, daughter 13, and my wife ) stayed at the majestic colonial punta cana from april 13th to april 19th 2007 from the reviews on this website , we thought that it would be beyond excellent , and were somewhat prepared for that we did not really receive that service , but i guess that is what you get for expecting too much we arrived after a nice flight at the lobby to a great first impression we were brought majestics , the resort 's signature drink , which set a tropical atmosphere after this , though , things did not go so well we requested pool - side connected rooms preferably on the second row or higher , none of which were available they gave us a set of keys for two rooms which they claimed were connected once we got to the rooms , we discovered just the opposite trip 1 from the lobby to a room and back to the lobby was completed we were given another room set which was connected they faced the forest not exactly the view you would like going on a vacation like this the next day we took trip 3 to change our room , where they changed us to first floor , connected , pool side rooms we were promised that sunday we would move to a fourth room , on the second floor and closer to the beach , exactly what we desired long story short : on sunday , when i went to change the rooms , they had mistakenly given them away thus , we were stuck in first floor rooms right across from the ice machine and closest to the theater , so we could almost hear every word from the animation team each night , listen to people yelling outside our door at 2 in the morning , and count the number of ice cubes people craved at whatever time of day the maids did a nice job my daughter was able to tell them to please make the beds in spanish , as they speak one or two words in english our first night we ate at the steak restaurant , which was comparable to peter luger 's in brooklyn ( no joke the chateaubriand was excellent , as well as the brochettes and steak we liked it so much that this was the one restaurant we opted to eat at twice the second night my sons and i went to the seafood restaurant , which was unimpressive my wife and daughter wanted to try le gourmet , so we split up for the night they said service was excellent , the atmosphere nice , but the food fair when they asked if they could bring their desserts back to the room for us , the waiters brought brand new dishes back overall , this restaurant had the best service from their opinions next , we tried the chinese restaurant eating at 6:30, we were practically the only ones in the room our food was out in an instant it was pretty good soon , though , we were forgotten it took what seemed like a week for our dessert to come after asking the waiters a few times monday we ate at the mexican/dominican restaurant the service was absolutely horrendous we arrived at 6:30, did not receive drinks until 7, and menus until 7:15 finally our dinner came at quarter of 8 the food was alright our final night , wednesday , we ate at the hibachi make reservations the second you arrive , this was the first opening for reservations , which we made a couple hours after getting to the hotel it was just like any restaurant in the us , only the fried rice was just a little different than the kids were used to breakfast was interesting i never knew churros could be eaten at breakfast , but boy was i wrong the crepes were very good , as well as the omelettes lunch was the same , but we found that the beach shack had a a better lunch , the breakfast place just was not that great we took the snorkeling trip one day from the hotel , which was a nice thing to do , especially to get the family ready for scuba diving the advertisement leads one to believe that you get certified for $95 per person , which is not true they required that i pay all the money 2 days ahead of time , so i walked down to the bahia principe and booked it there , paying right before the boat left for the dive the people at majestic 's scuba hut were hard to work with , i found the bahia people much nicer , as well as the fact that it was cheaper to take the dive there as with any beach vacation , for us , 6 nights/7 days was too long we stayed at iberostar puerto plata 2 years ago for 4 nights/5 days , which was not quite long enough ( by the way , this was 10 times better the compromise will be our choice next time , as we were bored out of our mind by the final day all in all , a nice experience , but we probably wo not be going back 
just okay first of all , i stayed at the majestic from march 8 ? 14 along with 33 other people who attended my sister in - laws wedding it was my first visit to punta cana it was an okay trip but i don?? think i will be going back to punta cana anytime soon i would advise you not to go into town unless you go on an excursion i would defiantly bring snacks and toiletries items with you the resort is very expensive a small can of chips and a candy bar will cost you $5 also sun tan lotion will run you $17 rooms : really nice for a couple however , the room is not comfortable for a family of four there is not really any private space to change unless you go in the shower or the bathroom stall the room is kept clean and if you want your sheets changed you??l need to tip the house keeper and leave a note in spanish also , for extra bottle water tip the man who delivery it not the cleaning lady i gave him $10 00 for the whole week and i had plenty of water in my room food : it was okay i am not a picky eater and i can eat almost anything however , i did not care for the buffets the group i traveled with is use to spanish and portuguese cuisine for which tends is rich however , some people in the group did have digestive problems please be careful , at the buffets because if it looks like they refried some of the food i would stay away from the mexican buffet if you are not use to rich foods the other restaurants were good ( especial , the steak house and the seafood ) drink lots of bottle water ( even to brush your teeth ) beach : great it was a beautiful beach but the water was kind of choppy i have visited a lot of caribbean islands and it was one of the nicest beaches i have seen however , bermuda is still the best pool : awesome it was a beautiful ??uge? pool ( one of the best i have ever seen ) staff : the bar tenders at the pool were awesome i would suggest tipping them if you want to be served before anyone else the active staff was great ( very friendly ) the employee who works behind the receptionist desk ??eeds a personality adjustment? it took us 3 days to get a wheel chair for a family member apparently , they did not have enough wheel chairs for people who needed them i give them a c - for customer service we did not have a problem with the language since some of us could speak spanish fluently children?? programs : sucks i would not leave my four year old wedding : it was a beautiful wedding it was definitely one of the best weddings i have ever attended airport/bus : when arriving at the airport get ready to pay a $10 00 tax per person ( including infants ) we booked through cheap caribbean and the bus that they use for transportation needs to be updated overall , the hotel was beautiful but , the all inclusive was just okay i guess i just expected and wanted more it is definitely not a 5 start they need to do a lot of work before they can call them selves a 5 star hotel i would give them 3 ? to 4 stars tops 
not so hot this is not run like a 4 or 5 star resort the beach is fabulous - - similar to bermuda pink sand facilities average for the most part : room is large with deep jacuzzi tub out in the open shower is spacious toilet is claustrophobic towels are at a premium , especially face cloths beach towels need to be returned to hut , but often runs out of clean replacements housekeeping standards are fair food is cafeteria style with no variations to salad bar ( you too can learn to love shredded cabbage ) includes decent ceviche we were very disappointed with fish/seafood offerings no made to order fresh dishes sitting around makes the fried , baked options very mealy , unappetizing best get beef at night local food at taino tasty skip the sushi and french altogether - - it 's a waste of time breakfasts have extensive offerings mini croissant and fruit are outstanding local beer is good mixed drinks use bottom shelf liquor ask for barcelo ( sp ) rum at no extra charge patrons were not typically binge drinkers - - lots of europeans  canadians who seem to hold their alcohol well bachelor/ette flings are raucus affairs weddings go on every day at various venues the entertainment is uninspired though the jazz sax was good our major complaint is with administration our toilet 's fresh water hose sprung leaks on two different occasions , oth in the middle of the night first time they fixed the hose the second they turned off the water and we had to wait until the next morning to get it fixed i 'll spare you the frustrating details except to tell you that they never apologized for my slipping and doing a back landing when i went to investigate the sound of rushing water that first night i slipped on the wet , glassy - surfaced floortiles and hit the back of my head on the tub they refused to cover a medical check to ensure i did not have repercussions from the blow to the back of my head very disagreeable front desk staff and manager the weather was consistently beautiful during our ten - day stay in february/march 2007 
fairly nice for an all - inclusive - 3 star quality hotel review : 3 5my wife and i stayed at the majestic in september of 2006 the majestic is a nice all - inclusive resort that has a more intimate feel to it compared to the other resorts in punta cana the place is pretty new and the vegetation around the grounds shows it also the service is hit or miss overall pretty good for the price and i ca not complain since it was $144 / night for both of us not that i expect 5 star quality at that price , i also do not expect them to advertise themselves as a 5 star resort food was ok for being an all - inclusive but probably same quality as the rest of the all - inclusives in the area it was nice to have a wide variety of foods ( mexican , domincan , tempenyaki ( more chinese flavored than japanese , french , steakhouse , seafood , and italian we had a nice time and enjoyed ourselves , if you are set on going to punta cana , this is a good choice for the value destination review : 3punta cana as a destination is great if all you like to do is sit by the beach and pool all day for 7 days , the pools are very nice and the beaches are great however , if you like doing other stuff like taking excursions , or going to the downtown for dinner or shopping , there are much better destinations when going on an excursion for example , it takes at least an hour or two to get to the where the activites are since the shuttle buses need to pick up people from 10 different resorts before driving 30-40 minutes to the activity also , there is not a nice downtown area the only shopping you 'll find are little artesan shops , which are ok but once you see one , you 've seen them all we probably wo not go back to punta cana for these reasons 5: do not expect to get a good deal down there in fact its cheaper to buy them from a reputable dealer on the web then to get them down there plus , in most shops they sell very low quality cigars , unless you know what you are doing do not stray from the classics and brand names stay away from don carlos cigar factory they picked up up from the hotel ( they advertise free transportation to - from ) , when we got there they told us they 'd give us a great deal and a discount on their cigars however , at the cash register he did not offer any discount and additionally he charged me an additional 3% for a credit card transaction i politely told him that i prefer not to make any purchases and that we 'd like transporation back to our hotel they had us waiting for over 1 we would have left earlier on our own accord but they kept promising that the car was on its way finally i called a cab these guys were creeps and not very customer service oriented note : my rating reflects the quality of the hotel and is not influenced by my overal experience in punta cana i hate it when people post a review complaining about things that are outside of the responsibility of the hotel 
but be very aware i booked a week vacation for myself and my girlfriend and the plan was the propose on the beach i had done a lot of research on resorts in punta cana , and based on reviews of other tripadvisor members chose the majestic what a mistake upon arrival we were put into the wrong room on purpose to see if we would complain i had paid extra for a colonial suite and when we went to complain about our garden suite , they just happened to have a colonial suite available , no questions asked did not make sense overall the hotel grounds are very lush and green the pool is nice and the beach , although rough is also very nice the rooms are not 5 star rooms by any means lots of leaks from the cieling when it would rain , our room would be drenched with water and it took 2 days for it to be fixed and when it was fixed it was fixed at 11:15 at night not very conveninent as for the food , not good at all we have been to other all inclusives in mexico and cuba , and the majestic 's food was by far the worst vacations are not enjoyable when you have to worry about what to eat my girlfriend got very sick and actually passed out because she was so dehydrated staff was helpful , even though they charged $175 for pepto bismol to calm her stomach beach and pool were the one bright spot of the trip proposed at sun set on the beach and she said yes some of the nicest beaches i have ever seen , however sometimes can get very windy staff and service even if you tipped , it seemed as the bartenders were doing you a favor now probably after reading this you might chalk it up to this guy had a bad experience , as i would probably have , however if you have been to any other all inclusive especially in the mayan , you will be thoroughly dissappointed , and i would recommend saving your time and money hope this helps have a great day 
not my favorite hotel recently got back from a 7 night stay at the majestic and felt compelled to write a review , something i 've never done before the quick summary is that this was not a hotel i would ever go back to first , however , let me start with the positives the grounds were very nice the pool was very large and quite pleasant , and the beach was nice as well the rooms were very spacious and were nice as well ( except for the bathroom ) that being said , when we got to the hotel , they did not have the type of room we had reserved rather than a room with a king bed , they had a room with 2 full size beds the room issue did get fixed for the second night but , i happened to be up at the front desk several times during the stay , and each time saw at least 3-4 people complaining about their room and being told to check back the following day to see if there was a different room available at least some of these people that we subsequently spoke to were not able to get their room changed the hotel was also very stingy with towels , both in the rooms and for the pool/beach the toilet in the room was literally set up as a tiny stall if you 're claustrophobic or if you 're a large person , you 'll have a problem with this the pillows were terrible as well luckily , i saw a review on tripadvisor before my trip , and had my own pillows with me , so this was not a real issue for me now for the biggest shortcoming of the hotel : the food let me preface this by saying that i am not someone who demands gourmet food , and i am usually not difficult to satisfy breakfast was average nice selection of fruit , different types of eggs , cereal , pancakes , french toast ( actually was closer to regular toast ) , etc nothing to complain about , but also nothing to brag about lunch , unfortunately was the exact same options every day much of it was from the previous night 's dinner it was not so good the night before , so repeating it for lunch was not very appetizing the dinner at the buffet was the same every night as well , and the specialty restaurants were not very good either my wife and i got so sick of the food that we decided to go home a night early , even knowing we probably could not get a refund for the last night 
liked it but not as good as sunscape the beach we stayed at the majestic colonial from december 16-23, 2006 it was our second time to punta cana we stayed a year ago at sunscape the beach we booked this trip last minute and based somewhat on the reviews on trip advisor the hotel property was nice the hotel requires wristbands that must be worn the towels require a card you are only allowed one towel per person there are reservations required at the french and japanese restaurants we found the buffet food to be only fair it was the same food daily the japanese and chinese restaurant was good we tried to ask for lobster with our steak in the steakhouse but were advised it was not allowed the bars around the pool do not use blenders they have crushed ice that are shovelled into glasses the kids club was okay the children played video games most of the day the girls working at the kids club were very friendly they assisted as much as possible the shows were fine we watched part of the michael jackson show and the trampoline show there were several nights of interactive participation shows the bars at night in the lobby had good drinks the would make expresso and blended drinks the main buffet restaurant closes at 10:30 am we advised it was a bit early when we showed up and it was closed the maid service was fair we noticed that the bathtub was not cleaned daily the mini bar was fully stocked the room has a safe there is internet access in the lobby the stores on the complex were expensive the entertainment staff were fun there were many activities and games the pool was huge during our stay the spa was closed for repairs the ponds on the premises were drained several times after a thunderstorm we met several people from around the world we had stayed previously at sunscape the beach and found it much better stb had free towels , did not require reservations , had not wristbands , had nicer rooms and had friendlier staff we would go back to punta cana but likely try another hotel or go back to stb 
not a five star , but beautiful resort well i have stayed at a sandals resort before , so i guess they kind of raise the bar when it comes to all - inclusives the majestic colonial is by no means a five star resort , however the grounds were lovely , the ocean is clean ( minimal seaweed ) and the rooms were well kept the food is not very good at all bring immodium as my party of 9 all got some form of sickness ( from bathroom issues to vomitting ) the staff is not very friendly , especially in the casino i would give the majestic a 3, and would not return there for the money we spent over christmas vacation to stay there also , many of the guests seemed a bit rude and lacking class i felt like i was staying at a holiday inn thank goodness for the beauty of punta cana and the gorgeous weather 
majestic - good but not great just returned from the majestic - a few comments :1 food was ok - presentation - great - watch out for salad dressings - other cold food - we got the tourist bug - snacking at night not possible - restaurant that we were told would be open late was closed - our teenage son was not happy2 pool clean and beautiful - ocean - great - beach clean - chairs available at any time of day3 resort is quite lovely - some staff friendly and helpful - lack of english can be a problem4 maid service sporatic - when i asked for clean glasses and cups - she simply rinsed them in the sink - using tap water that we do not brush our teeth with - not too hygenic - i went and asked at the bar for plastic5 saxaphone player is the best - at night - under the stairs - listening to him is delightful6 gym equipment ( treadmill ) not working - staff did not really seem to care - if you advertise a gym - make sure it is up to standardswe would not return unless they had their own water treatment facility - which other resorts do have 
nice resort but wo not go back we stayed from dec 10 - 17 at the majestic the resort was very nice and was probably 4 stars for a third world country we found the front desk to be not the most helpful and acted as if they did not understand english the rest of the staff knew very little english but were always friendly the pool was very big and very nice we were always able to find a chair the ocean was nice although they seemed to be having so weed issues , however the water was warm and the sun was wonderful the food was okay the dinner buffet was nothing special the breakfast buffet was mush better we eat at the seafood restaurant , which was very good , the french restaurant was nice by way overcooked the steakhouse was good but got a bug of some sort and had cramps and other stomach issues which are still not completely gone a week after we are home we found many of the other guests to be extremely pushing and at times down right rude do to the various languages being spoken we did not have the opportunity to speak to many other guests while we did relax and came home with nice tans , we would not go back in the future 
hmmm only for it 's looks we just returned from majestic colonial november 25th and yes we have booked this vacation with cheapcaribbean this is the second trip that we have booked and went to with them and they are one of the best on - line travel planners , and absolutely should be trusted one thing that happened when we booked through them is we have asked the travel agent to book us airplane sits and told her that we preferred front of the plane rather than sitting at the back , when we got to the airport we found out that she did not book sits for us , i do not know why or what went wrong maybe because it was an international flight she was not able to book those sits but it is a such minor thing over all she was very helpful in everything , transportation was provided as promissed , travel insurance was sent to us right after we have finished the booking process i give them 100% in terms of the resort itself gorgeous without a doubt , one of the best we have been to and we are picky in terms of food , it 's more of a 3* resort if you already booked do not get discouraged , i strongly suggest that you absolutely must visit steak house and seafood restaurants , we went to them almost every night instead of the buffet , seafood portion is very small they only would serve 6-7 shrimp on a plate with a small side or two but there was never a problem to ask for another portion , just politely mention that the portion served was very small , same situation with a lobster , it looked like a baby lobster : ) , i finished it in a minute , because it was that good and small : ) they brought out 2 more , no problem : ) ok , the famous japanese restaurant pleeeeeeeease , if you have been to the japanese restaurant in the united states and especially habachi , please do not waste your time going there i mean it 's not horrible but i would give it a 3 out of 5 the dominican chef did not show us any tricks , he just stood there quietly and cooked us chicken , shrimp , fish and rice with veggies in it , that was the habbachi ( not too sure how to spell it : ) ) japanese restaurant requires reservation , we made it as soon as we have arrived at the resort this restaurant consists of 2 things , chinese food ( for which you do not require a reservation ) where you can order not a very good food , as a matter a fact very very untasty sushi was a part of the chinese yakky , shop rite ( our local supermarket ) sells better sushi , i swear fried ice cream is a joke , they rolled untasty ice cream in crumbs and flumbe it ( set it on fire for a show purposes , yes it did look nice but the shell of the ice cream tasted burned french restaurant we did not go to because they would not let kids under 12 in it , so we missed our reservation , not a problem , we heard that people would get up in the middle of the dinner and went to either buffet or to a steak house or seafood restaurant ok , about a beach up to your knees nice and sandy , after that be careful rocky , a man got hurt because he was swimming and stepped as he thought on a rock , yes he did , but something was sitting on top of it basically he started screaming and was carried out of the water because he had some sort of the needles stuck on his feet , right next to his toes , he was carried to the doctors office service , only seafood restaurant had friendly staff , the rest would not even smile at you also keep in mind , they barely or do not speak english there , very very few of them do a lot of them say hello in spanish ola and if you respond hello or say first hello in english they would still say ola back : ) they do work hard no doubt but when we went to the market outside of the resort , 2-5 minute walk from the main gate we found out that locals dislike americans we pretended to be russians and one of them actually said , oh good , because i do not like americans but you do like american dollars ( because they prefer to get paid in us dollars rather than pessos ) entertainment , poor , when we went to jamaica , riu ocho rios entertainment was 1st class , and i thought food was not that great there , in comparison to majestic it was a 5 * : ) please do not get discouraged , noone has died there from starvation , there is plenty you can find to eat , it 's just below my expectation , since i travel a lot i expected better of this resort food wise and beach wise ( it was our first time in the dominican republic ) resort is gorgeous and just that will boost your vaation on it 's own forgot to mention the swimming pool , one of the best i have ever seen , does not get crowded there , very private and romantic rooms are the best too romantic and we were lucky we had the best view in the house ocean front and corner of the swimming pool , but most of the views are on the pool if you are on the pool side if you are on the opposite side you will face the garden , or the wall to the other resort : ( ask for rooms in the section of 2240+ up to 2252 or higher floors you will not regret have a wonderful vacation 
disappointment i??l try to keep it short and get straight to the point , since i know that it gets tiring reading long reviews we have traveled to the caribbean extensively all - inclusive places only destinations include riviera maya , punta cana , la romana , jamaica ( montego bay and negril was 4 of us : 2 adults and 2 kids ( ages 10 and 5 ) hotel is 45 min from the airport , could be more if they stop to drop others off before you check - in was fine , smooth i was able to get a very nice room , close to the beach , on the side adjacent to the pool , 2343, 3rd floor , with essentially a direct ocean view hotel is new , opened last december rooms , pool , lobby are magnificent pool is over 4000ft long , about 4ft deep throughout , with a huge whirlpool area , as well as several kiddie pools beach is fine , lots of chairs , but if you want shade , then need to be out there before 8am to reserve ocean - - not good water is way to rough at times reminded of jersey shore water the weather was great , no winds or rain the reason has to be the physical location of this hotel it?? much further up north , relative to other punta cana/bavaro hotels , away from the caribbean waters and much into the atlantic ocean early morning and late afternoon were better however , overall this water was unsuitable for us and especially kids notable absence of a wide variety of fruits , buffet selection is very poor same salads every day ( we were at riu negril last year the selection at buffet restaurant was several notches higher steakhouse/seafood restaurant is not bad , but it won?? fill you up japanese is ok , try it only if hibachi is a novelty to you , otherwise , skip it french , didn?? go ( don?? allow kids under 12) , heard very nice reviews though , so go didn?? try kids club is a grandiose castle/fortress with water slides and its own pool but it is completely misplaced and located near the lobby very far away from the beach and the pool they try hard , but skill level is low on the positive note , the saxophone player across from the buffet restaurant entrance is a very nice idea waiters are slow and tend to skip your table quite often bar service is ok , no problems there to summarize it , the most important factors for us are food and ocean/sea water with both of them being a disappointment hence , i would not recommend this hotel 
great resort except for the restaurants my wife and i stayed sept we are in our mid 20's and 30's i do not speak spanish and my wife knows just a little we 've been to the caribbean on a cruise and visited several islands , and stayed at an all inclusive in the riviera maya i read most of the reviews good and bad and thank you for those i always keep an open mind but also like to be prepared arrived at punta cana airport and purchased the $10 dollar cards , fast thru customs , avoided the bag grabbers that want a couple bucks for carrying your luggage 15 feet and went right to one of the tourist companies set up there i had only bought airfare and hotel , so i needed a taxi or a transfer to hotel there seems to be a set fee of $30 dollars per couple for a one way transfer in air conditioned mini bus so if you need a tranfer to a hotel , after customs , just go right to one of the tour companies there , i happened to go to funjet vacations bus ride was wild and fun , similar to driving in italy but with pot holes and speed bumps arrived at hotel after 40 minute ride , no wait at desk , guy spoke decent english , got a couple drinks and right to room here 's where i noticed a problem right away but still kept an open mind i had asked for a top floor room but got a second story room from other reviewers as well from past experience , noise from above can be a problem , plus tile floors echo sound now for all those that seem to complain about every little detail to the front desk and try to get a better room , well i thought about it the reviewers who did , seem to do better later i decided not to complain , i saw positives - the room was on the end of building , so only 3, not 4 neighbors and it was in the middle of the resort convenient to everything fortunetly neighbors above were fairly quiet but when furniture is moved , sounds like someone is vacuuming in your room , very loud for the room , exactly as expected , very large , jetted tub in middle of room with two sink bathroom , small toilet area and very large shower no problem with water pressure bed was comfortable for me and my wife pillows are long and thin i rolled my second one up for double support tv has variety of channels for when you get food poisoning and ca not concentrate to read mini bar always stocked every day maid came 4 days at 3 pm and 3 days at 10 am no problem with service and always pleased she even sprayed air freshener three days because in afternoon , we did get a musty smell from a/c it smelled like heavy smoke and i tended to turn the a/c off in the afternoon or make sure i was not in the room then smell sometimes came thru mid morning and late at night do not know if they have a problem with ventilation system as it may be smokers in some rooms sharing smoke with non smokers in other rooms i never noticed the smoke when it was time to eat why would i be in the room when its time to eat - food poisoning breakfast selection is excellent , lunch selection is good buffet dinner was best dinner meal we had besides gourmet steak restaurant had same food as buffet caribbean restaurant was bad except their buffet selection was ok the beef and chicken we got in our burritos and fajita 's was tough and inedible we took a couple bites and left the following day , i was stuck in my room for 2 days with no appetite and very weak luckily i did not throw up but did get diarreha ( however its spelled ) after i got my strength back and was able to eat again both my wife and i still have it but its finally getting better now that we are back in states so she ate at buffet when i did not eat we missed the fish and oriental restaurant we did manage to eat at the gourmet the last night there and that was very nice we both had chicken soup , filet mignon and chocolate cake all very good gourmet was only one we would recommend though you are only allowed one visit a week you can be carefull all you want when eating but you never know when the food will get you sick my wife and i watched carefully what we chose , ate a yogurt a day , and yet we both got sick we did see other people actually throw up at the restaurants but that was rare not much you can do but get better and enjoy the time you still have we never got sick in the riviera maya the resort : fantastic pool is long and has activities most of the time or has its quiet places bars all over the place try the cooc loco or the majestic drinks beach is very nice though swimming area is not that far into water you do have to be carefull of rocks plenty of chairs kayaks and windsurfing no pedal boats though which was disapointing more up to date people there , so fewer tops if you do not want to see breasts and - - - , do not go to the beach anywhere in other words , some of the men i saw out did the women in size so get over the sexism thing people have in america and either allow all to go topless and none at all spa was very good its good to know spanish but you can get by without it its polite to llearn a few common phrases and use them take the spanish lessons while you are there , it helps service was always very good checking out was easy , taxis are waiting at hotel and are $30 per couple at airport , you get passport stamped to leave , then switch lines to go thru security not much direction so be careful you do it in that order no a/c at airport and normal wait to get through security , so be aware drink water before security overall a very nice resort 
like hotel i like the experience in majestic i have been there with my wife 7 nights and they where the first holidays i didn?? know what to expect my wife was sic because the food we eat but nobody helps us and everybody told me to go to the doctor and i went it was very expensive to go there they have a very good professional in the hotel , they are alexandra and ricky in general the hotel works well the ( maleteros ) are very rood when you don?? give money 
majestic delivers the goods we spent a week in majestic colonial in punta cana in mid - july ( got back on july 27th ) and had a nice , fun , relaxing time the staff were universally helpful and friendly , the food was decent , our room was clean and spacious , and the beach was beautiful in sum , if you are looking for a nice resort with a beautiful beach , you could certainly do worse than majestic just remember that this is a highly developed tourist area and will not provide you with a nature experience ( be prepared to deal with seeing plenty of tour helicopters buzzing overhead , parasails , banana boats , motor boats , etc ) we hope that you find this review helpful punta cana : majestic is one of at least a dozen all inclusive resorts lining the beach , and all follow a similar arrangement if you walk on the beach west for about twenty minutes , you will pass all the neighboring resorts and it will be more peaceful , quiet and natural there , but no resort staff clean the beach at that point so some trash will wash up there walking on the beach in the opposite direction will take you past resort after resort for miles , some of them appearing very crowded some times salesmen from other resorts will try to lure you into theirs we took a sneak peek in some of the other resorts , and they each have different features we thought majestic looked the nicest , basically because of its huge , meandering pool grounds/facilities : apparently the place is only about a year old the shrubbery is newly planted , and very small , and the artificial fountains on the resort grounds are not all up and running , and the entrance to the resort is still a construction zone all rooms have nice balconies , or if on the ground floor , outdoor jacusis if you can , request a room with a pool or ocean view , as the garden views are kind of crappy the pool : sort of the centerpiece of the resort grounds , it stretches for about 400 meters , but is only 4 feet deep , so no deep end or diving the pool is warm , not brisk it has nice jacuzzi areas and is very pretty at night the beach itself : much less crowded than neighboring resorts , and we never had a problem getting beach chairs under nice umbrellas the water itself is divided into small , roped off areas - - one for swimming , one for the boat launch water is warm and full of fish even in shallow areas lovely beach for lounging , dozing , taking in the beautiful view , people watching ( see #9) water sports : the resort offers use of snorkel gear , kayaks , katamarans and windsurfing at no extra cost , but requires a 50 dollar lesson to use the katarmanans if you have never done so they also offer fishing , scuba etc at cost snorkeling : a 2 hour snorkeling trip ( actially about only 50 minutes in the water ) is about 30 bucks they take you out by motor boat out to sea where the water is deeper and the coral formations more elaborate it is nice but not breathtaking we heard catalina island was better , but did not go ( read below ) some people brought bread with them and fed the fish , which led to huge numbers swarming around you in our opinion the motor boat snorkeling trips should have been inclusive , not extra money there are several different kinds of all day or half day trips offered at extra cost we wanted to go to catalina island , but they only offered trips there with forced stops for shopping , corny entertainment , and so on , so we decided to just stay at the resort weather : it was hot and sunny pretty much the whole time , except for our last day , which was cloudy it only rained twice the whole time , both very brief periods a constant breeze came in off the ocean there was a pretty strong current moving sideways in the water , and sometimes larger waves which kicked up sand and effected underwater visibility wildlife : some pelican type birds at the beach , hunting for fish we also saw lizards and a large spider and of course , the fishes some notes and recommendations if you go :1) a couple of the restaurants require reservations book your restaurant reservations on your first or second day as they fill up 2) do not rely on the front desk for a wake up call - - we asked for one for 6 45 am and got a call at 5 50, and oddly another one at 6 most staff do not speak english they had several places to eat , our favorite was la hispaniola near the beach , which had seafood and steak menus they only let you have one beach towel per person the entire time - - a little stingy perhaps you can tip the towel guy and get an extra bring all the sunscreen you will need with you , as they charge rip - off prices for that stuff at the resort the enterainment is fun but cheesy , and a loud , roudy element congregates around the pool bar most of the resort patrons are europeans or other spanish speaking people , which is nice if you want to get away from other americans consequently , the beach sports lots of topless ladies and men in speedos , so be ready 9) be prepared to wear a plastic band around your wrist all week this is to distinguish you as a patron of majestic rather than one of the other neigboring resorts , and make sure you are not a freeloader go to the beach at night and look at the stars 
new mayan riviera let me start off with the beaches and water are absolutely gorgeous the resort is okay rooms look okay but air conditioner broke two times in a week stay , $5 coffee pot in room was missing basket and took two days for a replacement basket that had to be hand held to make it work food was comparable to a luby 's at best one exception was the japanese i do have to say that when you spend $3000 to $4000 for a trip for two you expect a 4 to 5 star resort and service this could be rated at a 3, max english is a minority for guests and the staff , not that this is an issue ( makes it more interesting and you get to meet different cultures ) just noteworthy i would also say that its a 50/50 of the impression that the people want you there and the other half dont i stayed at the secrets chain in mexico last year and as someone else stated maybe i peaked too soon i would recommend to stay at another resort 
great but not for us first let me say that i traveled to punta cana for the main reason of relaxation i speak very little spanish and my wife only speaks english this review will hopefully help others understand a little about the majestic as well as the dominican republic hotel : like others have stated , it is gorgeous we had a room on the west side with a horrible view but spoke to the front desk and were moved to a room near the wet bar at the pool with a view of the ocean the room , along with everything else there is gorgeous but did have some minor flaws in construction but i could of cared less things to consider with the rooms that we did not care for : my wife is a big bath person and it takes about 45 minutes to fill up the tub with the low water pressure rooms have somewhat of a mildew smell but not a huge deal last is the noise and the maid service we had some people above us that would move furniture around constantly and were so loud and the maid service usually knocked on our door each day around 8 they started earlier and you can hear them yelling to one another as early as 7 am not fun when you want to sleep in a little ( note to guys : i loved the fact that they had telelvision with cable in english after a long day at the beach it was nice to come in and relax to watch the british open we did not get sick our entire stay however like others we took pills each day to help prevent this food was very , very average the restauraunts have some good food but the buffets and such are very different it was not all bad however just bland and the spices and food they use there obviously have a different taste to them we ate pasta most of the time and that was usually pretty good beach/pool : gorgeous nice white sand and very clean we never had a hard time getting a few chairs anytime of the day it was easier at night as well my wife and i found it very relaxing to walk the beach at night we would sit and enjoy the sounds of the ocean as we looked into a star filled sky pool is awesome as well i love the fact that it winds down around the entire facility my wife and i never had a tough time getting chairs excursions : this is where you need to beware my wife and i took 2 off resort trips one was the bavaro splash where you ride your own jet boats to a specific site and you snorkle for about an hour and then you return this was pretty neat riding the boat is a blast and the snorkle area is outstanding you feed fish and see all kinds of aquatic life it is a half day trip the next trip we took was the sedona island trip this was aboslutely horrible let me first warn you that it is a full day trip and by this i mean we left at 6:00am and returned at 9:00 pm we left our hotel and drove 1 hour in a van we arrived at a location with about 30 others and loaded up on a bus where we then drove another 2 1/2 hours to a village where we went to the bathroom we then drove another 45 minutes to the beach where we got on a speed boat to ride another hour we spent 1 hour in a cove that was suppose to have star fish but was not better than our beach at the majestic and then spent another 2 hours at a very average beach we then rode a catamaran boat back which took 2 hours and then proceeded to take the 4 hour venture back on the bus it was a terrible waste of a day a 13 hour day and 8 of those hours are on a bus service : this depends some days it was great and some days it seemed as though the service did not really want to be there from what i am to understand they work 21+ days and then get 3 days off so i am sure they get rather tired of what they do i do not think they liked the fact that we did not speak spanish they do work hard they are always working on the grounds , cleaning , serving etc summary : i enjoyed relaxing at the beach and getting away from the world my wife and i met some terrific people from the usa and really enjoyed their company however , if you have never been to the dominican republic here are a few things you need to consider before traveling : punta cana is primarily a tourist location there is nothing else there but resorts this is great however consider the fact that this side of the island does not have any town life that you can visit to go shopping or walk around you are pretty much isolated to your resort because of this the excursions you go on you will have to travel a pretty good distance before you arrive at you destination 1 hour plus beware of the shops some of the workers get very hands on and pull you into their shacks last but not least consider that 95% of the employees do not speak english and even worse 95% of the tourists do not speak english as well this made it very , very difficult for my wife and i to enjoy meeting new people and taking part in the activities around the resort everything was in spanish and we often felt like outsiders due to the fact that we could not communicate with others around us it does not seem like a tourist location for americans because of these aspects we would probobly not return however , the majestic was gorgeous and the beaches were outstanding for relaxing feel free to email me with any questions 
needs a lot of improvement our family of 4- 2 teenage boys and my husband and i have done a lot of travelling to all inclusive holidays in turkey , tunesia , mexico and panama although the grounds and beach are very nice , the rooms were below standard for the money that we paid the air conditioner leaked and it was finally fixed after 3 days of complaining to our representative from canada the rooms were also very tired looking we could have upgraded to a better room for $15 00 us/person per day ( we had 2 rooms ) but decided against it as we were not prepared to pay the extra money all of the rooms should be at that standard i was told that the rating was given for the grounds and not the room status overall the food was very good and we really enjoyed the a la carte restaurants the people that work there were friendly and full of smiles but abrupt when they talk to you instead of saying would you like some coffee , they say coffee the bell boys are very pushy and will try to force themselves on you to help you with your luggage when you do not want them to having a knowlegde of spanish is helpful and being willing to try to communicate in spanish goes a long way to better service overall it is fairly clean and pleasant place but needs a major overhall to the rooms 
would i return we just returned yesterday from this hotel i had been following the reviews before we left and i know that everyone had a different point of view , different expectations this was my 7th trip to the dominican , so have been to some very good hotels and some not so good i went in being objective as to what to expect arrival at the hotel : transat is supposed to have a separate check in , and they do , but there is no indication at the front desk where it is , you just have to get in line and wait eventually someone from transat showed up and directed those that booked through them to a different area of the hotel , which there were no signs to indicate this after that check in was fine , except one of our rooms was not ready , which was fine , we put all luggage in one room when we did finally get the other room , it was facing the back dumpy area of the next door resort , the bedding was soiled , the room was dirty , we called for service and of course they said someone coming right away half hour later called again , still no one came the next day we asked for different room , which they gave us the next day , no questions asked , there are tons of people changing rooms food : the buffet was fine at first the tokyo a la carte was the best overall the italian was good , the french was also good the service in these a la cartes was great too the ala carte that is served in the marlin ( i dont remember what it was since we didnt end up eating there ) we sat there for half hour with people being served around us , that had come in way behind us we ended up leaving and going to the buffet late to scrounge up some food the pool and beach are great pools are well maintained the tide is very strong at the beach and its also very windy but beautiful none the less the resort is very spread out , takes couple days to figure it out yes there are things going on every day just takes some figuring out where the action is you have to know exactly where to look for this information or you are out of luck there were 4 in our group , and at some point we all ended up with stomach problems , whether from the food or drink , probably a mixture , as the non drinker also had problems this hotel is fine for someone that has never been to a real 4 star hotel as this one is not would i return to this hotel 
dont go here ever there are not enough words to explain the ridiculous events which occurred during my stay at this resort first off simple things such as showering became a hassle because the water would be turning off and on warm and cold by itself the entire time i really hated the smug faced the staff would give when asking them simple questions like were the restaurants are located and/or what time certain places open there are people who set up shop at the main walkway connecting the first pool and side stores all the way to the main steps which you come down to get to the beach the people who set up shop here would not leave any tourists alone and when bargaining would say things like i have many kids to feed and other problems in their lives i do not believe that should be said especially at a resort the shows were pretty boring and loud with not to much work put into them i have been to many different resorts as well as another one in punta cana which was amazing i have never had this situation any other vacation i have been on other than at this resort i had my brand new $500 camera stolen with a pair of pants right out of my room which i was sharing with 2 friends i could continue talking about other negative things that occurred in this resort but i believe i had said enough overall never go here unless you like losing items spending a lot of useless money and going to the only club they have there with barely anyone there in the first place 
save yourself the money i am going to give you our experience exactly how it happened and you can decide if you would want to stay somewhere like this we just got back last nightwe got to the hotel to check in and they basically ignored us and told us to stand off to the side after a couple minutes someone who barely speaks english comes and checks us in at this table off to the side , not even the front desk our room was not ready , so they told us to go to the restaurant , but didnt tell us where it was and they walked away we tried to get them to tell us when our friends would be checking in but they wouldnt the bell boy then walked our bags to our room we walked down these dirty , dark hallways our room had a good view , but it was dirty the bed was very hard and they didnt even have a full fitted sheet our legs and feet were on the bare matress the 'mini bar ' was barley stocked and was not cold the shower had almost no water pressure and would go steeming hot and freezing cold every 30 seconds ( no joke ) the tv didnt work , it was just all fuzzy and the clock didnt work because the clock didnt work , we would call the front desk every so often and ask what time it was , most of the time we would get put on hold , transferred around and evenutally hung up on ( this happened many , many times ) most of them also did not speak english the 'main bar ' by the pool has horrendous service the bartenders would just ignore us the first night we got there , we were standing there waiting ( for about 20 min ) and my boyfriend finally said excuse me to the bartender and she barely acknowldged him and when he started ordering drinks , then she walked away while he was in the middle of ordering and went to talk to the other bartender she didnt make our drinks and just continued to have a conversation with her friend at the seafood a la carte , we waited at the front door for about 10 mintues while all the workers walked by , ignoring us we finally sat ourselves , and when we saw the manager walk by we said excuse me and he held his finger up to his lips and said shhhh i was appauled they did the same thing to the next couple that came to the restaurant the tokyo a la carte was really good the best food and service we had all week the salad appitizer is really good the italian restaurant was good too there is only one buffet restaurant in the whole resort it is open 7:30-10:30am i personally think that the buffet was not open for long enough hours and the only other place to get food during the closed times is thesurf and turf snacks , which were disgusting do not eat the burgers there , they are never cooked properly and do not eat the fish burger , my boyfriend chipped his tooth on a huge bone that was in it i heard several other guests complaining about the food too the selection at the buffet was also very poor , the food was almost unedible i have seen others complain about the food at other all - inclusives , but have never had a problem with the food , but trust me , the food at the barcelo punta cana is very poor quality there were almost never any clean tables to eat at , and no one asked us for drinks , so you had to find your own cutlery and go get your own drinks the beach was gorgeous and the pool was nice too they only have one stereo system there , so if they are playing music at the beach , there will be no music at the pool and vice versa the entertainment workers were very pushy to get you to play games to partake in activities i was perfectly content watching my boyfriend and his friends play beach volleyball , but i had 3 separate male workers come up to me and harrass me to be part of a bikini contest , the second two that come over grabbed my arms and try to pull me over i was so angry i saw them to this to other girls too at nights , there were vendors set up on the resort to that you had to walk through them to go from your room to the restaurants they were very agressive i do not think this is a place that vendors should be i was really surprised that the hotel would allow this at the casino they tried to cheat us out of $15 the other couple we were with was playing black jack , and the girl in the couple set aside $40 worth of chips that she would not play with she did not want to lose the $40 when she went to cash it in , they gave her back $25, saying that is all she had after we argued with them for 5 minutes , the finally gave her the $15 also , do not play the 'bonus bingo ' we saw two different couples get scammed big time one lost $5000, the other lost $14000 you need to get to 100 points and you acumulate them quickly , both these people got to 99 point with a large jackpot ( over $50000us ) they kept playing because all they needed was 'one more point ' , but they never got it of course and once your in $1000, how can you stop excursions : do not go on the excursions we did the dune buggy one where the pictures show you going through jungles and on grass and on the beach and it is supposed to be 4 hours long they take you there on a sketchy truck in the middle of a very poor area while on the buggies , the do not give you goggles or any eye protection you drive through this poor town to this 'cave ' area with vendors set up all around kids run up to you and try to get you to buy all these things and if you say no they pout as you are walking to the cave , vendors are constantly harrassing you it is horrible you leave this area to drive through the poor town again and they take you to a beautful beach , but they only let us stay here for 10 minutes it was about 45 mintues in total the next excursion we went on was the marinarium it looks cool in the pictures , but its is not what it seems you go on a boat and they drive out to an area to take you snorkelling there was next to no fish or anything in the area , but there are nurse sharks and mantarays in an enclosed cage area not what i expected you only actually snorkel for 25 mintues , then you drive around on the boat and listen to very loud music the give you a very gross sandwhich you make yourself out of stale bread all in all , this experience would make me never want to return to the dominican republic again we were all excited to go home to vancouver i have never been excitied to leave a trip i would definately not stay at this hotel if you would like to go to the d 
varied standards we travelled to the domincan on 24th november , returning on the 1st december we had a wondeful relaxing holiday with sun every day so returned home with quite a nice golden tan ready for christmas the good , was the pool - both the quiet pool and entertainment pool , the gardens are lovely to walk around and the beach is clear of seaweed , with white clean sand and plenty of sun beds the waves were quite strong but hubby enjoyed the challenge - as a note on this we saw lady being saved - she was very distressed and the next day as we walked into the sea there was a young girl under water - do not know what might have happened if my husband had not scooped her up quickly - so be careful agreeing with the other reviews , the food was hit and miss - with the pasta and omlettes being really tasty but other foods not so appertising however we managed to eat every day so not that bad room standards were very disappointing , deffinately the worst rooms stayed in in the carribean , we paid abit more and travelled further in anticipation of alittle luxury - luckilly the weather made up for it but had we had rain the rooms were really dull and dismal - we did have a nice view of the pool area though as with other reviews , during the 7 days we only had toilet roll , two bath towels and hand towels once - the other six days at least one of the latter was missing - one night we had to towel dry with a flannel and the floor mat with help from the hair dryer although we had requested towels twice with the domestic staff and twice with customer relations on a positive note we did find the staff very friendly , helpful and cheerful especially in the main restaurant , bars and entertainment staff i have a different opinion of the domestic staff i would not return to this hotel - the sirenis cocotal and tropicale was far superior to the barcelo premium further along the coast also noting another travellers comments , we also had problems with the infight entertainment with thomsons - according to their air stewards - we must complain to thomsons to get them fixed , so please do complain to them if this happened to you i would visit the dominican republic again the island is beautiful and so are the majority of the people 
not a premium hotel but we still had an incredible vacation 5 female friends stayed at barcelo premium punta cana oct 31 to nov 7 the resort itself had many problems but we still had a wonderful time we reserved 2 oceanview renovated rooms with 4 beds and a roll a way bed the view was incredible but there were only 3 beds one rooms was changed very quickly we were told the other room would receive the roll a way bed we decided to freshen up since we had been travelling for more than 12 hours the power went out in our room only in 1 room we called the front desk to have that taken care of while we went in search of food the buffet was closed the ala cartes were closed we wandered around til we met raniel from the entertainment staff he directed us to a small grill that had hot dogs , mystery meat and french fries they were out of hot dog buns we explored the resort then returned to our rooms to unpack and get dressed for dinner power had been restored but we still did not have the roll away bed once again we lost power in our room it took more than 3 hours to get it restored when the roll a way bed arrived it was actually a filthy wooden door with legs on it this was not acceptable the assitant manager was not willing to resolve the problem to our satisfaction we wanted a room to accomodate 3 adults in their own beds this is what we reserved and paid for she told us that the only rooms with 3 beds were suites and that we did not pay for a suite i told her that we did not pay to sleep on a wooden door and that we did pay for a room with electricity she was willing to move us to another room for the night but we would have to deal with the hotel manager at 9am the next day we moved to our new room now we are in a different section of the hotel from our friends we are also right above the open air buffet so we listened to pots , pans , dishes and silverware clancking til 11:30pm and it started up again at 5am after a call to our travel agent back home , we went to see the hotel manager at 9am only to be told that he wo not be in until 4pm we spotted the assistant manager we spoke to the previous night today she was very accomadating she let us tour 2 available suites 1 was dungeon like with a king bed for 3 people the other one suited our needs perfectly we lost our oceanview but we did have a view of the fountain and the party pool the new room was not without problems no matter how much we tipped we never had enough towels one morning we were awoken by the sound of rushing water there was a waterfall coming out of the ceiling in the bathroom good news was it was landing in the bathtub overall the food was not good we lived at the pasta bar for dinner and loved the beef stew at lunch we ate at roma we enjoyed marlin so much that we made a second reservation we wanted to try the other ala cartes and were able to get reservations without a problem but the menu choices did not appeal to us the hotel should not allow the local vendors to come in 3 nights a week they are very aggressive and annoying the hotel gift shops are not impressive we did go to plaza blanca we were really disappointed with the shopping there also lots of junk and they try to rip you off enough with the negative we had an incredible vacation despite the hotel for us it was about having a great time with our friends we also met lots of wonderful people who we are still in contact with we will be returning to punta cana in january to visit our new friends but we will not be staying at barcelo the beach was incredible and the pool amazing wilson the lifegueard was very attentive i can not say enough good things about the entertainment staff adlo , algenis , raniel , franklin and gregorio are great at their jobs beware of a ballerina named sandy he kept asking me friend for money the team that works at the trapeze and trampoline are awesome i wish i could remembe the girl 's name one night in the disco she approached us because we were not dancing we were just enjoying the music she sat with us for a while and invited us to the trapeze the next day the beach party was alot of fun the night club was good there were not alot of people there but we made our own fun we went to the casino once there was no one in there except employees the new theater is beutiful but the sound system is poor the theater had the best bar in the resort the performers in the shows are talented but the productions themselves are low budget/ low quality i still enjoyed the music of saturday night fever and grease 
so i came to this website before we booked our honeymoon and i read the reviews a friend of mine had been here and said it was great my thoughts on the reviews were that people were just negative and had nothing better to do than complain and that there was no way the resort is that bad i was wrong i have never written a review for something like this before , but i thought that i should let people know my experience i want to start off on a good note the beach and pool area were amazing i do not know that it is possible for anyone to make a comparison they were perfect now for the rest of my experience we paid 500 more to have a renovated room when we got there , we had old rooms with leaks and were gross after speaking with someone , we had to spend the first night there and then move the next day to a renovated room this took forever , therefore , wasting part of one of the two whole days it did not rain the entire week with the premium package we purchased , we were guaranteed the following drinks when we arrived off the busb 20 dollars each for the casinoc 4 a la carte reservationswe did not get greeted at all let alone with drinks we only recieved 5 dollars each in casino money we only got 3 a la carte reservations and had to fight to get the fourth the new rooms were okay , but still not great the food is terrible and there is not a lot of selection the one saving grace for food was the pasta table where you picked your pasta and sauce and they made is special for each person unfortunately , there was an italian chef working there who only served italians if you were first in line , he would yell international and skip over as many people as it took to get to someone itialian twice my husband and i were the first in line and had to wait more than 20 minutes for our food after being continuously skipped over we ended up speaking to a manager about it the last day we were there there were constant floods and leaks and twice the ceiling fell in in high traffic areas such as the bar and the entrance to the main buffet my husbands boss called the resort wanting to buy us a honeymoon basket or some kind of gift and he was told that the hotel provides that themselves we never recieved any type of gift or basket around the hotel there were quite a few dangers and one of them was rusty ( what we think used to be fire extinguisher holders ) sticking out of the wall for someone to walk into easily and possibly slice their neck photo will be posted below there is even more i could say , but i think you get the point 
poor , poor , poor me and my wife decided to take a caribbean break this november , we did not go for a cheap holiday , or to just simply get away from the cold weather in england i had heard that the resort was very nice , and the fact that they append their hotel resort with premium made me feel that i was in for a great week well nothing could be further from the truth the holiday got off to a bad start as we arrived in dom rep once we had shooed away the case handlers who were instantly after my money/dollars - we were greeted with a 90 deep queue of people finding out where the transport was there was no rep from thomsons there , just a big queue - after 9 hours on a plane , its the last thing you want minutes later we were told our transport bus ok , we got on and was instantly sold the dom rep slogan - ( still no sign of the thomsons rep ) - no problem hmm , so its the caribbean , everything is easy and no rush i took that as charm , but as i later found out its an excuse for laziness , i think we have a similar slogan back in the uk , its called ca not be arsed we get to out resort and my case is not on the bus the idiots had just took off my case at the previous hotel and i had to go on my own with the transport man and his driver to get my case by this point i was a little fed up , especially after i had been guilt tripped into tipping the driver for basically doing his job seriously though the guy was telling us what a good tip was , suffice to say i gave less then then i was told , because i thought it was very cheeky wish i gave nothing now because i was not happy with the service ok , we arrive at the checkout , 2 or 3 receptionists all on the phone , this was to become a bit of a trend - i actually think its because they had not a clue and were asking superior members of staff please note i say superior in the loosest way possible ok , after 15 minutes of waiting and watching some clown type in numbers on a keyboard , ring people up , print something out , we eventually got our room card and towel form we were also informed at this point that the a - la - carte restaurants are to be booked between 9 and 4 in the morning ok , that 's fine we got sorted , and went to the bar for a pre - meal drink it was fine , nice daquiri - but i believe we were just fortunate i also noticed at this point the fairly sparse looking bar with no real options to choose from they had plenty of substitute bottles , like rum that 's not bacardi , or vodka that 's not absolute , etc but they were all in speedracks hidden out of view as we had no a - la - carte booked we moved into the buffet , and again i noticed lack of options not much choice , and what was on offer was greasy and fatty however i was not that disappointed because i expected it , and i was also intending to eat a - la - carte all week we also noticed the room was a little below par , door rattled , tv was poor and had intermittent signal problems that is when we finally got to the damn room - the maze that is the barcelo punta cana rivals the labyrinth that jack faced in the shining oh there were signs pointing in directions that were not possible to follow next morning we come down for the meeting with the rep , ( finally we meet someone from thomson 's ) - we were informed that we should have received our pre - invitations for the a - la - carte all week it appears that we were the only one 's with no pre - invites so that also annoyed me and smacked a bit of incompetence from a hotel reception that according to wellington the general manager and some american guy peddling a jeep safari thing , had its emphasis on p - r - e - m - i - u - m hmm , do the best hotels blow their trumpet in such a way i doubt it ok , we get to to the reception to find out why we have no invitations , and snail - girl proceeded to print out my invitations it was like pulling teeth i got no apology , no explanation , just the printed invites , and also the information that 2 of the days were left open and we had to book for those days separately anyway , the sun was shining , the pool was very nice , and the wife was happy however the pool bar was where we discovered the first real element of bar oddity we swam up and asked for a pina colada and a strawberry daquiri we were told there was no rum for ten minutes , but we were also asked if we wanted alcohol in the pina colada now i 'm sure it has rum in it , so i was confused i was also confused that the bar woman served three americans strawberry daquiri 's almost immediately after telling us there was no rum later that day we got our first taste of the rain , it did not spoil the day because it was gone in a flash but we had one more day of nice weather and then it was mostly rain for the rest of the week ok there is nothing that can be done with the weather , but what it did do is force us to look more closely at the faults of the hotel the lack of any kind of entertainment within the hotel ( three pool tables and a crap argos style dart board does not count ) - no tv reception during rain , untrained staff and lack of real character in the hotel really started to hammer home the failures that this place has ceilings were caving in by the bar , buckets were about to catch drips it really was a depressing sight now i have spent two weeks in riu yucatan in mexico , so i have pretty high standards so when i came across this hotel in dom rep , you can imagine my disappointment it was not even average , it was poor breakfast is also something that is not without its faults half the restaurant was open due to the season , but i expected there to be coffee cups on every table , and napkins on every table it made the choosing of a table that little bit more tedious one time we just had to sit down , flag down a waiter/waitress - ask them for a cup , wait 5 or 10 minutes , by which time breakfast was more than half way through , and then eventually got served but more often than not i just did not bother did not want to intrude on the no problem attitude this brings me back around to the lack of training or understanding of the language/accent i do speak a little spanish , enough to order drinks but more often i found myself speaking in two languages , and almost pointing to the drinks menu what i wanted for a resort that has an incredible amount of american tourists , i would have thought some kind of knowledge in english would have been a pre - requisite now it was not all doom and gloom , there were some bright spots but its a shame they were dragged down by the increasing amount of negative points those at that point were the in - room coffee machine not working , the tv remote control not working , or the replacement one we got also failing to work a leaking roof , rattling double - glazing doors - which just showed as shoddy workmanship wonky pictures , sockets fitted by a blind man , doors not fitting door frames neatly the ice machine outside also failing to work a couple told us we should complain and get an upgrade , but apparently the upgrades were just as shoddy and i really did not want to spend more time watching an untrained receptionist constantly on the phone for what remained of my holiday now the bright spots the pool is nice , the beach also very nice two a - la - carte restaurants - the italian roma and the japanese tokio they were stunning , especially the roma the french one let itself down by not bringing what we ordered we asked for a dish without certain vegetables and to be replaced with vegetables off another dish we were told it was no problem 
think twice before you go first the good news : beach was beautiful , great waves , had a blast the pools were nice although one was closed for most of the week i was with a group of friends , but traveling single i had a king size bed now the rest : i was on the second floor overlooking pool one , no ocean view the room was fine , maid service was kind of sketchy one day you had towels the next day none , same with washcloths ( i finally got one on my fourth day ) and toilet paper i had trouble with my in - room safe i had to have security come and reset it i had a leak in my bathroom ceiling which was fixed after two phone calls to the main desk we ate in the itailian restaurant twice , first time was quick service the second time it was very slow and it was also very warm , no air conditioning in the restaurants we ate at the french restaurant once , it was ok , but one of our travelers became ill after eating there we did enjoy the japanese restaurant the buffet was ok we did enjoy the buffet in the marlin in the morning as they had less people one of our other travelers had trouble in their room also with a leaky bathroom ceiling and inconsistent maid service bar service was very slow , of course the communication is one issue it was hard to get a bartenders attention drinks at each bar were made different so you really did not know what you were going to get as the week went on the rest of our travelers were becoming ill we took alot of pepto bismol and immodium so if you go take lots of meds with you we did take one excursion to island saona , we were told by our travel reps that it would take one and a half hours to get to our destination it took three hours although once we got there it was beautiful and we had fun , but a six hour round trip through some scary parts of the country i do not think i will go back to the dominican republic 
pretty good the resort was beautiful and there was fantastic service loved the drinks and the friendly waitstaff couple things to note : if you need to shower , do not do it between 4-7pm as everyone else is showering at the same time and so you have no pressure ( or no water ) and it is freezing make reservations at the restaurants for dinner the buffet is ok for breakfast , but really mediocre for lunch and dinner we actually lucked out and got into all of the restaurants for dinner every night only other complaint was the maid staff would never give us towels or toilet paper i do not know how they expected my husband and i to share one towel actually one night we ran out of toilet paper and i found a maid in the hallway and asked her for a roll she went and got it for me , but made a point to roll her eyes at me when i asked so would i stay here again 
please do not stay here i would suggest you never stay here we stayed there in april 08 8 of us (4 couples ) we went for a vacation and to renew our vows we all go south every year the experience was not a good one you need not know the detail just belive me do not stay there we have complained since we got back as well but i have concluded the management really do not care and oh by the way , if anyone from barcelo takes any time to read this , thanks for loosing the wedding vow certifiate ourselves and our friends signed and not really giving a damn about that either come to think of it , if this is the service you get fom one barcelo , maybe you get the same poor service from them all 
watch your valuables i went to the barcelo resort with my family it was my first experience in the dominicans at a 4- star hotel our second night there , we caught one of the workers going through my cousin 's purse red - handed he was not a maid he was in there with no permission my cousin was sleeping under the bedsheets the employee screamed olla in spanish a couple of times before he entered thinking no one was there my cousin heard the zipper of her purse opening she came out of her bedsheets and asked what he was looking for he ran away like a little mouse we called the front desk and they told us that he was a technician fixing something in the room it was ridiculous some little things of ours were stolen such as hand cream , lipsticks , etc we did not feel safe at all there during the weekends , they allow local people to come visit these locals were rude and loud it was totally unacceptable besides these issues , the service was great workers were pleasant and always singing their food was decent some of the local travel giudes were pushy in their sales pitch we went horeback riding , snorkelling , and parasailing it can be pricey but definitely worth it some of the people at the flea market were extremely rude would i recommend you going there avoid this place if possible 
ok now the honest truth truth be told i was so excited about this holiday never having been in the caribbean before i could not wait to go but boy i was so disappointed in this hotel long story - we went to thomas cook to book holiday in egypt and she persuaded us to go to dominican republic instead , we said that we thought it might be too expensive she told us they were doing a special deal just now and told us about this hotel and as it was only ?1660 ai for 2 adults we thought we had a bargain and could 't believe our luck how wrong we were we got home and did the old trip advisor thing and saw the mixed reviews , thought ok , maybe the americans ( cause lets face it they do like to complain and expect a lot ) were a bit overly critical so we would go with an open mind and an adventurous spirit rooms : - check in was fairly swift and the guys on reception were very friendly ( i did e - mail them in spanish to ask for a renovated room , i asked them nicely ) but there was no mention of this but i let it go as i wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to see if a non renovated room was not so bad oh my gosh it was , the smell as soon as we opened the door was yuck and the room was really tired and grubby , they were doing this section up (5420) i think and it was noisy with drills , hammering etc and the view from balcony was of a rubbish tip , i kid you not so having read the reviews and knew that many people insist that they are moved , we did too , it worked eventually we were given room 3445 with a bit of a sea view , and a great view of the pool , but we did pay an extra $200, this was well worth the money as the difference between old and new blocks is outrageous ( we later learnt that some people did not pay any extra to be moved , but at about ?8 extra a night we did not care so anyway the rooms were lovely but there were little black bugs in the beds that looked like specks but moved , there were little white bugs on the floor and ants everywhere , i think it was just because it was humid but man oh man they freaked me out when the lights were out - my darkness imagination the staff : - they were lovely and so friendly , santa in the paris restaurant is a treasure , she could not do enough for us she was great , we gave her a $10 tip cause we were into our 4th or 5th day and she was by far the friendliest member of staff we had met , we returned to paris restaurant and she remembered us and brought us our drinks from the last night we were there before we had properly sat down , we gave her $10 again and came looking for us a couple of nights later with a gift for us as a thank - you ( 2 little swan mr and mrs ) look for her she is great having said that the food is not entirely to my taste and i love trying new foods , i just thought it was a bit salty and ca not believe that full on cakes are served for breakfast , having said that i did manage to put on a stone in weight in the 2 weeks we were there we had stomach ache but that was too much over indulgence in the cocktails so served us right the beach : - is paradise , the guy who works really hard to maintain it 's beauty is taken for granted as a few ignorant people left rubbish at their backside even although there were bins nearby we tipped him $10 at the end of our holiday as he was so friendly and uncomplaining we had 2 seperate days of tropical storms that were really exciting and a great relief from the intense , overwhelming humidity that we had , and the staff were up and about at 4 40am sprucing the place up for us and it looked like the storms were just a bad dream ps - we did not use the pools as we reckon we could go to swimming pool in this country and with a beach like barcelos at your disposal you 'd be daft not to make full use they did look fabulos though and were cleaned nightlytips : - at first we tipped the bar staff $1 or $2 dollars each time but honestly it made no difference , first come first served and rightly so the female staff are by far much friendlier and more helpful than male staff ( incidently staff are paid around $300- $500 us dollars per month and any complaints about them results in instant dismissal , so do you really need to complain that service was slow etc to management ) we made a point at the end of our holiday to tip females we always tipped maids and fridge people about $2 dollars daily but once we forgot to leave anything as we left early and it made no difference but just remember it may be nothing to us but a hell of a lot to them entertainment : - most common complaint amongst the rest of holiday makers we spoke to is that at night there is nothing to do as disco is really smelly and dark and casino is an absolute rip off , theatre bar is geared towards spanish speaking guests and so having a few cocktails in the bar is just about all there is really brush up on your spanish before you go excursions : - saona island is to die for - the whole day is a day that will live with me forever , it was fab , we picked up great big beautiful shells on the shore and all in all had fabulous time monster truck safari : - unmissable - such fun and facinating to see the real dominica , take old clothes for the poor people at the railway track where the voodoo doctor is as they as they are so in need flies and bugs : - flies and bugs are everywhere but i think it 's because of the humid weather but after about the 5th or 6th day they really started to get to me as well as the really damp smell as it was everywhere i am not posh , high maintenance or fussy but after just about a week i wanted to come home , i have been abroad numerous times and usually am on a downer about 3 days before coming home cause i do not want to , i even imagine myself living there but not this time , i was ready for home about 8 days in and even my husband who never complains said the same thing - mega expensive , over inflated prices just what you would expect from hotel shops really but pay in dollars and get your change in pesos so take both summary : - barcelo premium punta cana - great beach , great female staff , tired and smelly communal areas and entertainment at night very poor , overall this hotel is in dire need of a makeover any questions - e - mail me and happy hols x 
glad to be home we stayed at this resort form sept 14 - sept 21 and am very glad to be back first let me say that i usual read alot of reviews before traveling and think that people are being too picky also , but i was wrong this time almost everthing that they say is bad was bad , especially the food my friend was sick for 2 days ( take diarrehea medicine ) beach was beautiful and so was our room we had rm 2409 and it was remodeled and had a great view with no smell and fairly good maid service this resort caters to foreigners but not americans very hard to communicate with staff we will for sure look for a american owned resort next time i ca not imagine this place in the spring when its full we will never go to a barcelo again due mainly because of staff and food 
bacon hair and food poisoning upon arrival , they take us to a room that was old i did not like the smell of mildew and the loose hair that lingered on the floor i was very critical i went back to the front desk to argue of what i saw in the pictures compared to where we were staying it was similar in furniture , but very different in cleanlieness he had a solution , another room a third room , same problems they did not notice the smell no matter , the language barrier made it difficult to explain after tiresome efforts arguing in spanish and english and two hours of delay , they move us to a room that looks fantastic it 's newly renovated , they call it a deluxe room it had granite , tile , ceiling fans , flat screens , luxury bathroom ( exquisite ) the pools were very nice , the location of the resort was amazing the all inclusive package does not really include your gratuities , because if you do not leave tips , then you get slow service and lack of smiles most bars were over crowded the buffets offered variety bacon one morning had hair on it i do not mean hair from someone 's head it looked as if they had slaughtered the pig and cut too close to the belly i 've seen hair on chicken , never on pig i hope i was wrong , but it was enough to steer me away from the bacon they do not have standards for cross contamination of chickens and porks it is very likely that the items you eat there are not the most sanitary if you 're thinking of going , do it , it 's a nice place , but take plenty of probiotics and eat lots of yogurt while you 're there the pools were very nice it was not a bad stay overall , but my wife 's food poisoning or montezuma 's revenge , whatever it was , made it dreadful 
not a 4* hotel - barely a 2* room damp , smelled of mildrew and sick room cleaned , but whole room damp , so damp made the books pages curl up , tablets to dust complained , but they could not smell it showed us another 5 rooms , but all the same no refurbished rooms available had to use a towel over the pillows so that i could sleep - it made me feel sick one man got sick in the pool - nobody cleared it up , the pool was not even closed for cleaning kids can get easily served alcoholic drinks - so beware advised rep , said some rooms are damp - - what not a 4* hotel , lets other 4*s down food = samey roma restaurant - v good service , attentative rest of the restaurants - they were not worried really when faye was passing over , water flooding into bath room - obviously room had previous problems bathroom , old , manky , needed desperate refurbishment some things were nice but not value for money and not 4* quality have been to other hotels in dc , far superiour 
here is the real deal about prestige class : ? our room was not recently renovated ( as the transat website indicates ) , only the club premium and some rooms in the middle of the hotel were you get only 4 ? la carte reservations ( not 5) , and they are pre - arranged so if you do not like the ones they choose you have to make new reservations at the hotel desk? no fruit platter on arrival ( although i would not recommend eating fruit there ) ? no beach towels , robes or slippers in these rooms? bottle of rum? mini - bar was not restocked daily? casino voucher ( do not be fooled its like a coupon , not free money you have to buy $20us in chips to get $20 in free chips only for card games , not slots ) *reference ( http : //www referrerid=vatlangid=enrefwhatid=101css=agencyid=hotelid=13947) foodmy boyfriend and i got very sick from the food ( meat ) and lost 2 days of our vacation the outdoor buffet by the pool is where we think the bad food came from food is uncovered and left out there for who knows how may hours the best food is from the ? la carte restaurants , but food was not that good overall roomi would rate it as a 3* the bed was saggy in the middle and there was never any hot water in the shower or any water pressure for that matter the a/c was hardly working the room was never cold oh , and our pillows were yellow from other peoples sweat/wet hair they smelled soooo bad servicewell , the staff seemed friendly , however , things took forever to get done our sheets did not smell fresh and the towels that were supposed to be clean came back dirty at times the mini - fridge did not get filled every day tips do not seem to insure proper service at this hotel hotelthe grounds were kept clean elevators did not work most of the time workers were everywhere fixing randoms things like railing rust as opposed to the leaking overhead hallways lights guest safety does not seem to be of top priority these workers were dropping roof clay tiles to the ground ( right through a busy entrance to the hotel ) the 2 large pools were super fun and clean beachbeautiful , clean and lots of fun vendorsthey are everywhere and will always try to give you free stuff to guilt you into buying overpriced merchandise they are willing to bargan with you they are very annoying thou overalli think the hotel was just ok , we had a good time despite the flaws at the resort and the bad food you should always remember that its the company that you are with that makes the trip , not the resort 
did not catch the 4- th star just returned from a 6 days trip , for first time , in dominican republic got a good deal from orbitz at barcelo premium , punta cana : - beautiful and well maintained beach , gardens , pool - spacious , 2- nd building pool - view room with balcony ( and later on noticed the cockroaches in the bathroom ) - flat screen tv with no signal for the entire stay - nice day time activity - ok good breakfast and deserts - nightmare of horse back riding trip with el pat ranch horses overworked , looking ill with bonds sticking out i hurt my ankles during the trip ( rubbed against the metal stairs over the horse back the left ankle was bleeding ) and no emergency kit at the ranch i was sent for ankles care at the resort could not contact the french owner of such successful business : we were 35 travelers/35 horses at the el pat ranch tour no emergency medical attention at the resort could not help because i did not have an insurance i had to insist to get , at least , a small piece of cotton with disinfectant without looking at my ankles the dr send me at the reception to solve this problem i just soaked my both feet in the salty water of the ocean - the massage at the spa not worth $70 for 55 minutes session the therapist , polite , but not skilled i get regularly massages at home i was sent by an european couple to another resort to visit and maybe try their spa services two days later , i got an awesome massage at iberostar resort (30 minutes away by walking along the beach ) for only $50, on the beach - i noticed on fri local guests got a nicer/friendlier bar - service as well as all the spanish - speaking guests i wish to all of you that read this review to make sure you 'll build a beautiful vacation that is the reason i wrote all of the above that was my barcelo resort experience 
a group of us went down for labor day weekend for a friend 's wedding at first glance and on the website - the hotel and grounds look nice absolutely no service what went wrong the ac did not work the power went out twice ( as did the water while in the shower ) the hotel was dirty , linens were not clean towels were not fresh we had bugs in our room and in our bed the floor was not clean - and was never mopped the spa - pedicures were done out of a dr scholls foot soaking thing ( like the ones you 'd have at home ) and nothing was sterilized also , appointment was for 4:30 pm - they did not start until 6 pm i had my hair done - i paid $45 usd to look like i came out of the pool and went straight to the wedding they ran out of beach towels , everyday and the towels were old and stained absolutely no service from anyone , bad attitude could not make reservations for dinner - everything was booked at every restaurant they had cheap local liquor and everything taste like coffee i ordered a margarita and it was a coffee - rita the buffet - flies all over the food - i 'd ask for coffee or juice - no one would bring it the scrambled eggs were egg soup in the evenings - they would set up a flea market in the lobby/main corridor and haggle you as you walked by i would not rate it a 2 star overall - the service is horrible the disco/club - again , gross drinks - dark and dungy - it was like a dark dirty cave not many tourist - a lot of locals i have stayed at other all - inclusives in punta cana and have had a great time will return to the area - but never to this hotel 
no towels we thought the rooms were lovely however , the service was absolutely horrible one would think that since the resort was on the beach that there would be plenty of towels available for the guests , but there were none there were no clean towels in our room nor at the pool we had to complain everyday because we did not have towels my husband , a very gentle man , had to go down to the front desk each day to complain loudly about the poor service and the lack of concern for the guests we could not find any responsible person who actually seemed to care about our problems with the service the food was not tasty during most meals i met several people who said that they were never comin gback and we agreed 
service and food were horrible we just returned from punta cana yesterday and we are very happy to be home our stomachs are actually starting to feel better here are some notes for people looking to go there our deluxe suite did not have air conditioning we had to wait in lines at the lobby desk for a couple of hours just to be told that it would be fixed this happened three times and finally our shower only had scolding hot water well that was the straw that broke the camels back my husband had to go to the front desk spending three hours trying to get a new room they finally gave us a new room that was better the people that work at the hotel seem like they do not want to be there they are miserable they spend alot of time either talking to the other workers behind the bar or aimlessly walking around the bar and not helping anyone waiting for a drink the maids were the nicest of all the people who worked there do not go in the swim up bar pool a man puked in the pool while we were there and nothing was done about it later that night we walked around the pool and it smelled of urine and had a green look to it the food was not edible starving , we decided to go to the french restuarant hoping for something good well , that did not happen the teenage boy sitting at the table behind us threw up all over the floor and his family just got up quickly and left leaving the throw up on the floor without telling the waiter imagine the smell that meal was over before it even started the only good thing about this trip was the crazy wheels adventure we took totally worth it the beach was amazing and clean also , for those people who are starving there is a hard rock in town that was good this hotel could really be an excellent resort if they changed two things management and food 
terrible hotel me and my boyfriend have stayed only one night in this hotel because as soon as we checked in we realised that the hotel was just terrible the food served in the buffet is just unbelivebly terrible to book a reservation on the other restaurants you have to wait in line that at 9am goes outside the hotel the employes are not nice and the hotel has cleaning problems the rooms smell very bad and are very old ( beds not confortable ) if you are going to punta cana do not pick this hotel besides the operator travelplan that woks with this hotel has told us that this was a 5 * hotel can you imagine very bad service form the operator travelplan 
beware of terrible customer service dont get me wrong it is a very beautiful place our room was an ocean view deluxe and the beach is gorgeous the people that work there are just terrible if your american - you will not be treated well every employee had zero sense of urgency and to be honest just very rude , however nice you are to them my boyfriend and i ran across a total of three friendly employees in the whole place also the lobby is a complete nightmare checking in and out was horrible and making dinner reservations , which had to be done everyday and you could not book any days in advance ( i waited in line for an hour for one reservation if your not going to 'adapt ' to the carribean lifestyle well , then i would suggest skipping out on the barcelo punta cana and finding a place with a better understanding of customer service 
a good time i have never been the one to write a review , but i feel it?? unfair that this hotel is getting such bad reviews this hotel in on great property and is situated on a gorgeous beach the swimming pools are amazing there is one pool which is livelier and plays music , has entertainment and has the swim - up bar the other pool is very relaxing with built in loungers to lye down on and spraying water , both pools are very big the kid?? water playground makes me wish i was a kid all over again , very cool for families the food at the italian , dominican , and japanese restaurants was amazing the buffet food was okay defiantly check out the tex mex restaurant for lunch if you are looking for a sit down , relaxing lunch near the beach yes , this hotel did have some problems but what do you expect when you aren?? staying at a 6++ ( and trust me things do go wrong at any hotel you stay at ) i am a very experienced traveler so in comparison to the many other resorts i stayed at which were mostly all 5+ hotels , this hotel did very good some of the negative aspects of this hotel include : our room was clearly one of the older rooms , but it was kept very clean and we were never in it anyways and if i had to search for another negative the nightclub did stink like vomit the worst part of this hotel was the service unfortunately the service was the worst i have seen out of any resort i have stayed at not the typical ??riendly and amazing? you would expect to interact with at a hotel it seemed as if most people didn?? care if you handed them a tip ( some never even said thank you or smiled ) yet , other people at the resort had no problems and found the service to be very good the wait to get a drink at the lobby is out of control they defiantly need stronger management but overall , the hotel was very nice and we met some really cool people and had an awesome time defiantly if people need to rely on a 100% perfect hotel , this is not your hotel this hotel is for people who want to have fun , have patience , and make the best with the people they are with i went on this vacation with my boyfriend and we are in our twenties and it was perfect for us 
good for money but nothing to go back to , management needs a rehaul we were at barcelo punta cana for eight days and badly needed the ac and good drinks food was awfull hotel rooms stink sometimes service was bad in the first few days but it got better as days went on beach and pools were the best part of this resort shows were ok , no american or international drinks , little spanish is highly recomended try tokio and roma resturants , rest are waste of food beach towels were the hot commodity bottled water has no taste but there are no choices all hotels in punta cana have no air conditioning in the lobby or public areas so bring a portable fan 
good time with fair accomodations my husband and i vacationed to punta cana and we were both a bit unsure about what to expect after reading the reviews on trip advisor overall we had a great time the location is beautiful the water is clear and blue , the sand is clean , and the weather was amazing we went in with an open mind and had a really good experience we met a lot of different people from diverse backgrounds i mean how often do you get to play in a beach volleyball game with a team composed of dominicans , canadians , and europeans we might not have spoken the same language but we had a great time anyway we made sure to take advantage of all of the freebies the resort offers free snorkel equipment , boogie boards , kayaks , and half hour catamaran trips i would recommend taking advantage of all of this we stayed in building 3 and had a renovated room we started off with a room in building 2 that did not have an ocean view i persistently asked if we could move to a room with a view and did not have to pay extra for the room change i overheard some other couples paying an additional $15 per person per night for the same upgrade however , i will say that our upgraded room had a drip from the ceiling due to the air conditioning we just put the ice bucket beneath it and let it go because the view was amazing ( plus i did not want to wait in lines anymore ) service is extremely slow and be prepared to wait in line for help it seemed that every couple we talked to had issues with their rooms there is very little consistency i would recommend trying to get into building 1,2, or 3 with an ocean view i wanted to offer a piece of advice for dining when we arrived we received reservations for 3 restaurants however , 2 of our reservations were for days we were not staying at the resort we had read reviews about the food and it seems that everyone has their own opinions we took our chances and just showed up that first night at tokio we had to wait 10 minutes but they let us in i thought the food was similar to eating japanese here the second night we decided to show up at romo and again found that we could get in with just a short wait the food was ok here - i stumbled across a piece of hairy bacon that has been mentioned in other reviews the third night we tried to get into el mirador - the tex mex restaurant so i attempted to wait in line at 9:00am the following morning to get us a reservation i waited till 9:35 before it was finally my turn and i learned that the only restaurant that was available was the dominican : ( needless to say we attempted to again to the tex mex and gave the hostess a $5 and got right in i enjoyed the fajitas and my husband had a combination platter with a taco , quesadilla , and fluatas this restaurant was our favorite in summary about the restaurants if you do not mind waiting a couple of minutes then you do not have to bother with waiting in the reservation line the pool is beautiful and the drinks are pretty good we found that there was inconsistency with the drinks you might order a pina collada and love it one drink and the next drink not as much again i would keep an open mind and embrace the opportunity to be in a truly diversified setting 
please go somewhere else there is no ac anywhere in the lobby or in any of the restaurants all you do is sweat non stop there is ac in the rooms but i would have been better off having someone blow on me the service is a joke we asked for a cot for the room they thought we wanted a cat , so it took three days to get it and it was at 3 am when they delivered it the grounds are a little dirty , we saw a rat and a floating feces in the pool the bathrooms throughout the hotel were rarely cleaned we met some people who hated it so much they got an early flight back the worst part is the food we all survived off of bread for the week if you are thinking of this place because it is inexpensive keep looking you might be able to find something better for the same price or even spend the few extra hundred it would be well worth it , this place is a complete waste of money last time i went me and my husband stayed at sun scape at the beach it was beautiful i would definitely recommend that place not this one 
loved the beach my daughters ( ages 26  22)  i stayed here from 7/6-7/11/2008 we had a decent time but there were problems check in was a nightmare - spent 3 hours in the non - airconditioned lobby waiting while being told 20 more minutes or being ignored however , once we did get to our room , it was clean , comfortable and had an balcony facing the ocean housecleaning was excellent - asked for lots of towels and got them the fridge is stocked by someone else - just leave a dollar in it and it will be crammed full the room ac was nice and cold the beach and ocean are absolutely beautiful and the resort offers many water sports the girls loved the boogie boards ( and they are free for an hour at a time ) i went down early each morning to secure a palapa , otherwise it would have been way too hot to stay on the beach for more than a short time although there is always a great breeze the food was not great , but we always found something we could eat the hotel caters to europeans and canadians - so do not expect american food the alcazar buffet is huge and comfortable ( for breakfast and lunch ) , but we prefered the marlin - smaller and could sit there in your bathing suits drinks were very sweet so we usually had the local presidente beer which was good getting into the specialty restaurants was tricky there were suppose to be dining coupons given to us upon check - in others had them and apparently the hotel assigns a restaurant and a time for you if you did not get coupons or did not like your assignments , you needed to go to the lobby and line up starting at 9am each day it was a long and usually disappointing deal - we could only get 9:30 pm reservations we liked the italian the best we also enjoyed the tokyo ( although my daughter was very ill the following 2 days ) the mexican had the nicest view , ocean breezes and good service , but the food was poor except for the chocolate mousse in the coconut shell keep in mind that most of the restaurants are not air - conditioned and are very hot the hotel grounds are beautiful and were constantly being cleaned or repaired ( with the exception of the gym - broken glass door and equipment in poor condition ) the pools are nice - one has a swim - up bar and the other is more family  children oriented the crew at the trampoline/rockwall/and trapeze were great - friendly and knowledgeable - fun and safe not much shopping - but several afternoons  evenings there were local vendors selling jewelry and pictures - we got some nice larimar and coconut necklaces and earrings outside of the hotel there was a flea market about a 20 minute walk away - it was just toooo hot to do it ( and we are shoppers to no evening activities ( casino and nightly shows were not impressive ) so , if you are looking for lots of activities ( other than the beach ) this is not the island for you we did have a good time because we are beach people and just needed to relax for a few days we were glad that this was just a short trip - 5 nights was enough 
do yourself a favor and dont book this crap every summer my family and i travel to another country to relax and enjoy our vacations we have been to the galapagos islands ( which is the best place we have ever been ) , europe , australia and many others this year we chose punta cana , dominican republic and let me tell you how bad our experience was first of all the staff is terrible they are not polite and hate their job they hate americans and tourists second , we stayed in the bavaro palace which is supposed to be a 5- star hotel for us , it was like a 2- stars hotel it looks like a big econolodge hotel third , the food if terrible too flies are everywhere and even the breakfast cereal tastes like its been out of the box for months fourth , the pool is dirty fifth , the a/c lowest temperature in all rooms is 24 degrees which is hot for most of the people from other countries if you decide to drink from the all - inclusive menu you will be soon enjoying your vacations in the restroom 7) dont expect to see good looking people there 90% of the tourists are cubans and mexicans 8) everything is terrible here dont book this hotel if you are looking for a 5 star hotel on the flip side , the beach is nice but nothing like australia or the galapagos if you are looking for an out - of - this - world experience go for the galapagos islands and stop in guayaquil for a few nights people are great 
beautiful resort and beach , questionable customer service for the positive - this is a beautiful resort with semi secluded beautiful beach and ocean high marks for beauty and cleanliness we stayed in a suite which was also 5star for those traveling with children beware that there is topless sunbathing the signs say for this to not happen at the pools , but it is not enforced same is true that it is posted to not reserve cabana deck spots , you are not supposed to and everyone did on certain days , local vendors are allowed in restricted areas of the resort to sell their wares nice for quick shopping , easy to avoid if you are not interested you need to know what you want to drink to order it from the bar , alcohol or non - alcohol as there are no signs posted as to what is available there is a language barrier as all the staff speak spanish and most are not interested in communicating in any other way the tvs are all spanish channels the food is fine , when you can get it be sure to reserve your spots at the restaurants the pools are wonderful bars are accessible for drinks for walk - up service no waitstaff to wait on you everything is self serve we upgraded to the premium club which helped quite a bit that staff was more interested in being helpful and providing a higher standard there is a premium club room where one can go to relax , eat or drink they also handle your check=in and check - out the negative - if you plan to travel here , we must warn about the weekends apparantly this is when the locals are allowed on premise as well and it is an absolute zoo they are rude and pushy on the weekend we could not eat , they literally took the food from my children 's plates and knock you out of line at the buffet they splash and takeover all of the pool and beach activities and do not allow others to play on the weekend , everything , and i am not exaggerating , became a full contact sport to just get anything accomplished from grabbing a towel to trying to get a frenchfry monday thru friday - the place was laid back and relaxed with plenty to go around for all the other negative - with the exception of a few , the staff is not interested in helping you for example , we paid for an expensive 2 bedroom suite (1 room for the 2 kids , 1 room for us ) when it was time for bed , we pulled out the sleeper sofa for the kids and it was literally broken and completely unusable without any linens we called premium club and also main reception 4 times on this over a 2 hour period for some assistance , every time we were promised someone would come , and no one ever did we did not even have linens for the sofa bed the first night , my children had to sleep on the floor as they had no bed rosa , with premium club , had the bed fixed for our 2nd night as i said , a few are willing to help , you need to find the few to know - do not drink the water , only bottled water there is a dress code in the restaurants limited non - motorized watersports this is a large resort , spread out it takes a little bit to learn the layout and what is available 
pack a lunch very nice hotel , great pools , beach is gorgeous , rooms are nice and comfortable food is friggin ' horrible not only is the food kinda nasty , but be carefule b/c it will make you ill imodium ad ill where 's my rolaids ill tokio restaurant is the best place to eat , but hard to get seating the service is a bit negligent i ca not tell you how many times the public restrooms were out of toilet paper and all things considered i needed tp requested extra towels on second day and i 'm still waiting on another day the housekeeper totally forgot to restock towels and i had to ask five times , including going down to the desk and refusing to leave until they gave me towels you are on their feeding schedule if you sleep in a bit late , but not realllllly late you 're screwed late night hungries you get shriveled up chicken wings and undercooked fries granted food was not my primary objective , but a girl needs energy to lounge in the sun  drink unlimited drinks oh - stay away from coco loco 's too coconut water is natural laxative do the excursions saona island , santo domingo , etc the weekends bring the locals , and subsequent racism ( 'oh my god , they let the dominicans in um , you 're in dr do not be a jerk decent hotel , nice price , but i 'm sure there 's better 
you could write a book this was the first family vacation for me in three years and it was the worste the only good thing was the beach and pool , but could have been better please do not read this and think i am a picky person or miserable this truly was horric for the thousands of dollars our family spent on this trip and we could 't even have a decent meal ( breakfast , luch or dinner - a la carte or buffett ) this resort was not our original hotel , ( sunscape was ) we were placed here by our travel agent per her recommenation from the moment of check - in it was down hill the service was extemely baddd there was no smiles on the workers faces only the time of the green dollar bill , they would not even except their own money , times is hard for every one and money is money also there is very bad to none ventilation in this hotel meaning that , if you dont request for one the newly remodeled ( if u want to call it that ) rooms u will probally end up with a mil - dewed , sweat shop type of room we did stay at one of the new rooms but i had the oppertunity to sleep with roaches , if this is premium i do not even want to know what standard is our beach view was a view of a construction site , where locals sit and wait for a possible job oppurtunity and then u have the ones that work in the resort that cant even say hello and barely the site of the beach at all the food was absolutely horrible me and my family nibbled on food that i wouldnt even feed my dog also my family had the pleasure of dining with rats we did inform our agent of this nature , and pretty much nothing was done , for we were there and the money was in her pocket please review all reviews before taking the jump into this place beware and do not say i did not tell u so 
do not go to barcelo premium punta cana for weeks leading up to this vacation , i was planning to have the time of my life this resort is unforgettable for the worst reasons we arrived in the punta cana airport and were escorted into what looks like a tiki hut you will need $10 per person to get into the country they do not take traveler 's checks so have the cash prepared our luggage came out in a timely manner , but on a different luggage claim belt than what the monitor 's claimed after we claimed our bags , we had to find our tour company that was going to take us from the airport to barcelo we were told to walk into a parking lot with about 100+ vans , and little other guidance after finally getting to the resort , we had to check in i am not going to explain my fiasco but it is exactly like the others here long lines , a long wait , and nobody that speaks english we were escorted to our room it was a new room in the renovated section of building 3 our room was very nice for the exception of it would not exactly get cold the a/c could never get the room cold enough the fridge was stocked , but again crank the fridge up to 9 or 10 it makes a great difference when you come in from the beach my fiancee asked for 6 days straight to get more towels so she could wrap one around her hair we are still waiting for it to show up the beach and pool are gorgeous the sand is so soft and the water may look rough from a distance , but it 's great the pools are wonderful they were always clean and seats were always able to be found the alcohol is watered down and bartenders are not consistent some bartenders are better , but the alcohol is cheap and variety is lacking it 's pretty much generic rums , and vodkas the wine is just disappointing do not bother i will try to be kind about the food it was terrible so prepare to loose a few pounds on this vacation there is not much to eat at this place breakfasts were tolerable the buffet has a guy making omelettes these are tolerable at best stay away from fruits and the milk the milk is not pasteurized lunches are okay try the burgers next to the pool they are not too bad the fries are close to what we find here in the states load up on these because dinner will be bad they have white rice at the buffet near the pool stick with that you will need it to settle your tummy the specialty restaurants are all lousy the best ( and it is not great ) are tokyo and roma the seafood , dominican , buffet , texmex and french are barely eatable there is not a place to get chips or snacks that remind us of home customer service at this resort is terrible i had several problems and they did not seem to want to satisfy my problems if you can speak spanish , it may help your cause overall , i would not recommend this place at all please just spring for the extra couple of dollars and find a different resort it was a waste of a vacation boiling it down to the basics do not go to barcelo premium punta cana 
honest review just got back last week my husband and i go somewhere different each year , and know what to expect from an all inclusive resort so here is my honest review the resort itself is beautiful the grounds are well kept the pools are both great the beach ( white powdery sand ) is wonderful and probably the best beach spot in punta cana ( very long stretch and very wide ) the water is beautiful , very big waves that will knock you down if you are not careful not so good for smaller children ) the animation team was not as involved as most at other resorts there was definetly a lack of interaction here with them the nightly shows were not that good , although they do try very hard the food at this resort was absolutely the worst that we 've ever had at an all inclusive keep in mind we do not expect much from all inclusives , but do expect edible watch out for the bacon ( i got bacon for them to put in my omelet and when i went to crumble it up for them to put in my eggs it still had about 5 black pig hairs still attached ) ewwwwww needless to say i didnt have an omelet after that toykio was the best by far the el mirador ( by the new pool was pretty good for lunch ) paris was pretty good italian and dominican resturants were horrible we didnt try the marlin i basically lived off of bread , fruit , and french fries all week ( and i am in no way a picky eater ) lol it was ok though at least i didnt pig out on vacation service was very slow it took us 2 1/2 hours at the italian resturant for 2 of us but it 's ok you 're on vacation you just have to go with the flow workers were not very friendly at all they rarely smiled or anything last year we went to laromana , dr and omg the people there were amazing and sooooooo friendly that 's why we chose the dr again for this year we fell in love with the people and the beauty of the island fridge didnt get stocked the first 2 days , so i finally got the guy out in the hall and he told me sorry and to leave him a note on top of fridge of what i needed each day so i did along with 2 dollars each day for him and my fridge was stocked every day renovated rooms are wonderful it is definetly worth the upgrade it did rain on us one day , for 12 hours , so i was really glad that day that we had upgraded to a new room with oceanview we just ate lunch , opened our balcony doors to hear and see the rain and took a nap lol did not let it put a damper on our vacation we did not have to be at the airport until 3:00 on the day of our departure , so we asked for a comp room so that we could shower before we went to airport ( since you have to be out of your room by 11:30) so we turned in our luggage and went to the pool to enjoy our last few hours well , when we went to comp room to shower ewwwwwwwwwwwww the room was filthy there were dirty towels everywhere , dirty diaper on the bathroom floor we didnt have time to say anything we just got in shower with our flip flops on , and hurried up so we could make our flight do not get me wrong , it is very nice of them to give you a room to take a shower before you leave , and i didnt expect it to be spic and span clean , but that was just plain grosssss conclusion : i fell in love with dominican republic last year , and will definetly go back again however , i think that more people need to visit laromana instead of punta cana it is much nicer in my opinion for many reasons first , laromana ( carribean ocean ) punta cana ( atlantic ocean ) not a whole lot of difference in color of water , but much more calm in laromana ( better for snorkeling ) second , people are sooooooo much friendlier in laromana they treat you like family third , food is better quailty in laromana ( probably due to the fact that there are quiet as many tourists there yet , so they can use better quaility ) lastly , because it is soooooooo much closer to do many of the excursions ( if you like to do them ) not stuck on a bus for 2 hours each way to get to where you go to saona island or altos de chavon if you go altos de chavon is definetly a site worth seeing anyway i wish you all a wonderful vacation , and remember it is what you make of it , so enjoy , it goes by fast i have lots of pics from laromana and punta cana if anyone wants to see them also if you have any questions feel free to ask 
worst holiday of my life what was supposed to be a dream holiday turned out to be a nightmare i wanted to forget where to start the service was unbelieveable , unless you carry a 10 dollar bill with you everytime you go to the bar do not expect to get served and even then be expected to wait up to 20 minutes a time - would not believe but is very true there is no table service throughout the whole holiday everything is pretty much self - serviced , staff maners the worst i have ever seen rooms never cleaned and shower did not work properly but was not fixed again due to improper service no clean towels and when rang for towels had to wait an hour and a half fridge in your room was also not stocked with anything unless you gave them 10dollars a day rooom also flooded but was not fixed and had workers on the roof above us at early hours of the morning do not leave money aroung in your room even as little as 1 dollar it will not be there when you return no sence of security or safety , one evening we had a strange man peeing on our door we rang for reception and after half an hour we had to ourselfs go down to reception and ask why no one had come to see us i dread to think if someone was attacked what would happen another couple we also met had their room broken into and their valubles stolen and again nothing was done people are free to walk in and off the complex if they are not staying at the hotel which was also very worrying list s endless , but i would not wish my worst enemy to stay at this hotel and have had better service in blackpool 
do not waste your money we went with two young children they enjoyed the kid 's area - pool with slides and such however , our room was never cleaned before 5:00 pm after a phone call requesting it the staff did not speak english we were in the better refurbished room , but it had a leak in the bathroom that made it impossible to use the sink the staff seemed resentful and unfriendly they looked right through you if you did not have a tip for them the food made us sick - flys everywhere save your money stay home 
nightmere in barcelo hell thanks to my travel agent who stuck us , a party of 10 people , in the barcelo premium punta cana resort was the worst vacation i have ever had we booked originally to sunscape punta cana and 6 days before we leave on vacation the travel agent from liberty travel states that sunscape has closed and she was notifying us the same day sunscape contacted her (6 days before we leave ) and she stated we are going to barcelo premium punta cana and we did not have a choose in the hotel the travel agent highly recommended the place and said she stayed there and she loved it i found a few good reviews on tripadvisor but my sister found horrible review a few days before we left god we should have just cancelled the trip and lost the money because this hotel is not a 3 ? star is a 1 star hotel when we get to the hotel we booked for ocean view at sunscape and what did we get at barcelo mildew view , yes mildew running down from the ceiling to the wall that was discus ting and sickening no way was all these kids staying in those smelly and mildew room to get sick it took us 4 hours to get a check in and then request a better room the food was horrible when you ate the food guar teed we all went to the bathroom a few hours later with bad stomach pains the kids were so sick that they stayed in the room for 2 days , what a vacation right don?? even try the al a carte restaurant because they are no good either we booked one night at the seafood restaurant and because we were 10 people they decided to sit us outside the restaurant next to the pool area and feed us at 9 pm that was so embarrassing and top it off there was a huge rat that ran next to our table imagine all of us screaming and we told the manager and guess what they said , ??h we dont have a rat no you must of seen wrong? we know what a rat is that beast looked like he was a guest at the resort we found mold in the bread , and hair in the salad also the customer service was the worse the employees ignore you and not even a smile instead look at you if you were from outer space or something at the buffet we went to get food and i left my cell phone on the table by the time i got back with my food the cell phone was gone , yeap it was stolen and when i claimed my phone they all said we don?? know about it we did not see anything top it off i tried 4 phone calls to sprint and i kept asking the reception area why i cant call the us and they told me ??h we don?? take 800 or 888 phone calls this unset me alot because i was paying $1 00 per min and they tell me that my calls were not going through at the end i had a bill of $20 00 calling my brother in the us to get sprint to call me at the hotel sprint stated 2 calls were done within the dominican republic in the last 30 minutes and i had lost my phone already for almost 2 hours the rooms if you go to this hotel try to get an upgraded room in building 1-3 but just to let you know you won?? get towels if you don?? request it , also toilet paper and you will sleep with guest in your room ??he roaches? my sister in law had a roach going up her arm when she was taking a nap we were always at the reception area requesting that our rooms get cleaned and have supplies but it took several times before they did that and be prepare when the housekeeping people go up to give you towel they will only give you 1 towel even if there are more people in the room there is no activity for the kids to play except at night at the sports bar there are games for them , that is where our teenagers were most of the nights while we were at the other room for adults the only good thing this hotel had well was the sports bar the employee , juan carlos and anely was the kindest and nicest employee we met at the hotel they should not be working there since they are so nice and welcome everyone so if you do go to this hotel go and meet juan carlos and anely they are the only two employees there working if you are booking to this resort i would not recommend it not even to my worst enemy we are back home thank god and time to see a doctor because our stomach is not right after this vacation what a way to throw money down the drain on a vacation oh yeah and the ocean is not caribbean water it is the atlantic ocean it will be a very long time before we ever go visit d again and booking with liberty travel never again for this horrible experience that we had 
affordable , but not worth it weather - beautiful , amazing when it rained , it rained , but only for 5 minutes and then it just gets hot all over again beach/water - one of the best i have ever seen amenities - from the beach side , there is lots , but $$$$ if you do not find it at the resort , just walk over to next or the one after and you will find it on the older side was old looking but more up beat on the newer side , more quiet and no music more for relaxing but it looked amazing food - the rest on the new side is the only place worth going as well as the buffet do not trust the food anywhere else and never ask for water there alcohol - crap all generic brand unless you go to the new side strongly recommend you bring a bottle yourself beers are crap as well we just ended up going to the resort next door and grabbing drinks there and walking back towel service - this is the worst first off , you have to wait hours and hours to get a towel everytime you ask them , 5 minutes by our 6th day , i just lost it on the poor towel boy and management 5 minutes later , i get fresh towels the worst part of my trip was the towel service at the end you have to return your towels or towel cards to the front desk or you get charged what kind of a hotel is this 'rooms - unless you are on the blocks on the new side , forget about it i think they are blocks 3, 1, 2 they are much nicer and the staff over there is better we had block 6 holy crap , if you were not out of your room by 8:30am , they would not come back to your room to clean it we had to tip the cleaning staff that much more just to get our room clean but to be honest , you do not really stay in your room all that long during the day just be sure to ask for clean sheets i had a pen and marked my sheets with a mark , and for the first 2 days vendors - holy crap guy or girl they will grope you haggle , haggle , haggle you will get it for the amount you want to pay customer service - pretty crappy if you ask me certain people might be nice to you and you just got to stick with them good luckoverall the trip was ok cause there was 4 of us so we made the best of it would i go back to punta cana 
enjoyed the barcelo stayed the the barcelo for nine days april30 to may 9, 2008 got a great room in the same building where we were meeting friends from new hampshire maid service wonderful fresh towels every day they stocked the fridge daily with water beer and soda one could request what their prefrences are trapeze , ice rink kiddie pool and slides drinks a tad strong , but just tell them to let up a little on the alcohol food run of the mill for a resort this size , but always something for averyone specialty restaurants easy to get into , and the food was good many shops on ground floor of resort medical center available the philadelphia eagles cheerleaders were there doing a photo shoot one of the girls was injured on the trapeze , and she got excellent care at the clinic weather amazing , and pools clean one draw back was the sand fleas on the beach , which we encountered 2 years ago on a different resort in punta cana when the resorts are not full , they open the rooms ( for a fee ) to the locals they can come fri and sunday nights and leave by 3:00 monday these locals were rude , noisy and ate and drank constantly the public bathrooms were filthy over the weekend even the local employees do not welcome them we are tippers and they are not it is not required to tip , but we always bring at least $100 in ones also little gifts for the chambermaids ( vt maple syrup , sample boxes of whitmans samplers , other inexpensive gifts ) and tip them daily , as you never know when they will be going home and a new maid takes over we also get great service when we tip we tip here in the united states , why not tip in the dr really had a fabulous time and would recommend this resort to anyone , even with small children connie and dick in vermont 
false advertisement i would like to warn people not to go by what is said on the barcelo punta cana 's website on their site , they mention that the hotel was renovated in 2007 however , only half of the hotel was renovated so , if you do not pay the highest price , you will end up in the old rooms , which smell of humidity and badly need new bed covers also , their website specifies that if you choose the prestige class , you have certain advantages such as a special line for prestige customers when they arrive , therefore not having to go through the regular check - in line surprise , surprise , everyone on our trip had the prestige class so everyone was in the same line - up they tell you you will get $20 to go to the casino again , false advertisement when you go to the casino , you need to add your own $20 to be able to play and if you win any money , they take off the original $20 they supposedly gave you if you have a room facing the 24 hour bar , change it asap unless you like being waken up at 1, 2, 3, 4 even 5 in the morning by gangs that are there to party they have security on site but security does not do rounds to have them quiet down 
nice holiday in spite of the barcelo and air transat this is the first negative review i have ever written about a vacation but felt i should share our experience so others could avoid what we were not able to we have traveled extensively throughout the caribbean and europe but this was our first time in punta cana and first experience ( and last ) with air transat punta cana is lovely the beach is fabulous and the weather was great i would go back , but not to the barcelo all in all we had a fun family vacation with me , my husband and our two teenagers (13 and 16) in spite of the disappointment with this property and the tour operator if we had not had such a desire to make the best of it i think this would have been a forgettable holiday it began the week before departure air transat changed our departure from punta cana to toronto from 9:30 pm to 1:20 pm which means that essentially , we lost our last day at the resort ( having to be on board the shuttle to the airport at 9:40 am i do not know of any other service or product where a consumer can book and pay for the purchase ( for us - 2 months earlier ) and then have the product changed without re - negotiation of the original contract rather bait and switch in my opinion we were delayed 2 hours leaving toronto because the plane was late arriving into pearson so instead of getting there at 9:30 pm we arrived at 11:30 ( too late for dinner ) we booked two rooms with a request that they be close together upon arrival ( tired but excited to be there ) we found out that the rooms were in different buildings this meant that either mother/ daughter in one room and father/son in the other ( drag for mom and dad ) or try and get it changed initially , this did not look possible until i slipped the front desk clerk $20 u it took 45 minutes to work out but we finally got rooms in the same building ( #5) , same floor  kind of close to each other take air fresheners the dampness and mildewy smell was disgusting there were also bugs in the bed the rooms were well below what i would consider 4 star however , if we wanted to be moved to the newly renovated buildings (1, 2  3) we were advised it would have cost us an additional $100 per night we made the best of it and did not spend much time in the rooms the food was not very good with the exception of the restaurant roma roma was wonderful most of the staff seems disinterested , some even rude , but there were a few good servers mostly at the bar ( figures ) bring some small bills for tips it makes a difference this is also the only all inclusive resort i have been to where room service was not included you had to pay extra for room service the casino was small but lots of fun the big lagoon pool was nice try the mud slide at the swim up bar also , bring an insulated drinking mug with a lid for canadians - the small 'bubba ' found at canadian tire is perfect it will keep your drink nice and cold and save you from multiple trips to the bar ( usually long line - ups ) to get another drink in a plastic cup ( think dixie cup size ) if you??e looking to book a trip to punta cana , check out the bahia principale if you have already booked the barcelo , don?? fret about the negative reviews at least you??l have more realistic expectations and really a vacation is all that you make it??ith good attitude and positive energy 
save your money after our departure flight from punta cana was canceled , my fianc? and i had to misfortune of being booked at the barcelo by american airlines there were about 250 people on our flight that were re - routed unexpectantly to the barcelo while the appropriate repairs were done overnight to our plane at first glance the hotel looked okay nothing like the pictures that are online and nothing special upon arrival , we were greeted by the numerous , drunken guests that were strewn all over the lobby couches the room that we were given looked newly renovated but the new renovations were quickly muted by the dirty bed linens , uncleanliness , mosquitoes , and loud guests our room ( including our bathroom and bed ) looked as if it had been sprinkled with black , human hair ( not hair from your head ) from one end to the other the one meal that we did have while staying on the premises was breakfast if you like food that looks like flies have been swarming all over it the entire morning then this is the place for you the staff was not warm and welcoming they did , however insist on speaking spanish as much as possible and did a great job of pretending they did not understand anything but spanish if you do stay at the barcelo and are there for some rr , i recommend that you do not stay anywhere close to the bars , casino , or pool otherwise , you will be kept up all night by the extremely loud , drunken guests my fianc? and i are young , fun people who love to have a good time unfortunately being startled awake in the wee hours of the morning by other guests and their loud shouting is not my idea of fun my fianc? and i are avid travelers and both feel that this resort does not deserve the high ratings that it is getting from other reviews save your money there are plenty of five star resorts in punta cana that deserve the five star rating the barcelo , however would not be one of them 
no thanks - will not return room was average even though we had a newer/renovated in block 1 - 2nd floorfood was poor and very repetitivepools a little better than average , how ever chair/umbrella games in full forceallot of night time noise - kids drinking , bell boys , and rooms with doors that have significant gaps when closed you can still see in some of them beach was excellentbiggest complaint was when our pool bag was gone through and my wifes watch ( an older movado ) was taken it was kept up on a ledge with no vacationer traffic except for the pool maintenance staff we are convinced one of them took the watch and stashed it in the hot tub area for retrieval later in the day hotel security and front desk staff were no help even if the watch came home with us , we would not return much better all - inclusive places in the caribbean or mexico that value customer service , which is clearly lacking in many parts of this resort 
ca not sweat the small stuff i guess the hotel and its surroundings were beautiful and appears very clean my boyfriend and i did enjoy our stay but had many disappointments during our time at the hotel and when we got home we had both been down south at least 3 times each and have never gotten sick that changed the night we arrived home and had to go to the hospital for over a week we both have had severe diarrhea and vomiting from a bug we picked up at the hotel but on to the hotel and our stay first when we got there the keys did not work , no towels/beach towels in our room , nothing in our fridge besides 1 bottle of coke it seemed like they cleaned the room when someone left and did not restock it next we had to wait 3 or 4 hours for beach towels on our first day we had to wait in line for every a la carte we went to ( although we had an appt ) the thing that turned me away was the 3 inch cockroach i found crawling across the bathroom floor at 2am and the ants everywhere also the group of very loud 16 year old drunk boys that hung out by our hotel room at 3am every night the parents ( who were our neighbors ) were almost as bad on their terrace every night while these are only minor complaints they did put a strain on our stay overall the hotel was nice , the staff was great , the food was good and there are plenty of things to do at the resort 
pack a lunch second time to the d/r and it will be the last one to this resort the resort looks very good from the outside and looks promising the bell boys were helpfull and if you play with your wallet they become a little more helpful , and will maybe rub lotion on your back things went wrong :1) our rooms were wrong we booked rooms that were deluxe vip ocean views with the works and got something that was not the room was ok but right away we were not impressed with what we were forced to stay in the front desk staff looked at us like we had 7 heads and just did not get what we were saying the women we went with ( god bless them ) tried thier best to fight for us but was unable to convice the hotel , ok no big deal normal rooms it is 2) food is garbage , like if you go here you better pack some choclate the food was horrible , we survived off of orange hot dogs and undercooked hamburgers as well as bread 3) water pressure in the room felt like i had a dog pee on my back , it was ridiculous , i might as well of had a cleaner pour a bottle of water on me to get the same effect 4) main bar was 24/7 and every teen in the world decided to party hard until morning which is totally fine , but alot of people started to complain that they could not get any sleep 5) food but it was bad 6) bar tenders hate you until you play with your wallet , just remember that , and try to get one bartender and stick to him or her 7) security - the security there was pathetic , being in law enforcement myself i was very dissapointed in the way they looked and acted , for example there was a girl who fell and hit her head on the beach and floated back to shore , the security just stood there and watched her as a domnican doctor who looks 15 came running out with a bandaid it was sad and if i had seen the accident i would have stepped in immdiately 8) birds - they will eat your food when you get up for 5 of a second it was bad thier aiming for the beer next i just know itgood things : great beach , if you can find shade , great drinks and both pools are fantastic the resort is beautiful and has some really good spots for good pictures for you shutter bugs 
disappointing hotel , great beach as many others have indicated , the two pools , beach and grounds are lovely the food is varied and not too bad , although somewhat greasy and repetitive after a week i did end up with severe stomach problems towards the end of my week there , which lasted several days upon my return to canada i only drank bottled water , drank almost no alcohol and generally have a cast iron stomach , so it must have been the food we booked with air transat be aware that prestige class means nothing you do not get any upgraded service or amenities the beach towels are a scarce commodity , and there are no welcome drinks our room was not ready for several hours after our arrival , and we were forced to either leave our luggage unattended or drag it around with us in order to use the free casino credits , you have to spend an equivalent amount of money first as others have noted , the dinner reservations are often very late at night and i was told they could not be changed , even though the restaurants are empty from 8:00 pm on the room fridge was not restocked , even though we left generous tips the tv did not work , which was disappointing only because there is not really any place to go at night the beach was beautiful in the evening , but we did not feel safe there after dark having said all that , it was not a bad vacation , simply because the beach was so awesome however , i would not return to this hotel the service is generally good , except at the front desk , where it is terrible 
read on if you have not booked yet , i will make it short we returned yesterday from the barcelo it is a beautiful resort if you stay in buildings 1, 2 or 3 if they put you in one of the older buildings , ask to be moved go see the head of reception tanya , she is great old buildings (4, 5 and 6) smell and the sheet are absolutely gross new building is a five star compared to the old ones the food is not to write home about but we did not get sick the a la cart restaurants are not too bad the japanese one is a great experience our boys loved it 5 out of 5 at best the beach is fantastic great for smaller kids as well lots of walking , fine white sand and clean the beach at the barcelo is pretty clean except for the sigarette butts bring your own or make sure that you have clean ones before you go back to your room at night it is absolutely impossible to get a clean towel before 2 pm we love the d three times now i do not know what they do to their staff but they are not too many happy people working there there is the odd friendly staff member but most of them are miserable as well , they seem to have no rules about staff eating while they are working i found this very annoying lots of smokers make sure your room is a non smoking room if you do not smoke as well , ask to be seated in the non - smoking part of the restaurants overall , if you can get this trip for a great price , go for it try the catalonia nicer people and better food beach is not better if you are late teens , or in your twenties , lots of people around and they seem to have a great time if you are a family with young kids , ask for a suite , great kids waterpark ( in full sun ) and fantastic beach not a lot of other kids to play with put your name on your toys as well 
great value for the money well , first off i have to say that we paid $1000/person before tax for this trip during spring break - so everything i say is relative my fiancee and i had a great time largely due to the fact that we got a great deal and were there to enjoy the sun , surf and sand not to mention the booze if you have read the reviews on the hotel , do not get scared , it 's clean , the staff is friendly and the location is fantastic the best part of our stay was choosing not to do excursions but rather to spend the money on a professional photo session the on site photographers led by georges gurascier are phenomenal georges took us on an expedition around the grounds and along the beach and took some of the most spectacular photos i 've seen and i 've seen a lot ( both my fiancee and i used to be models ) in an hour and a half he captured close to 200 great photos that were almost impossible to choose between after the session was done , he edited and compiled the pictures and even offered to ensure that they were printed and ready for pick up before our departure the next day even if you decide the full photo session is not your idea of fun , make sure you take a photo on the beach with any of the tropical animals they bring each day ( monkey , iguana , parrots , boa ) for a few bucks you will have a truly spectacular picture , that you can see the edited version before you buy - and they will edit out everyone on the beach if you want take my word for it go and see these guys they are located in the hotel , just next to the main pool - check out the pics i attached when it comes to the rooms , you get what you pay for the hotel was recently purchased by barcelo and they are in the process of renovating to date they have completed the new pool and restaurant and 3 bulidings out of the seven that comprise the hotel it seems that the renovated rooms go to the guests from europe or the us who have paid more for their trip the old rooms go to those on package deals with air transat , skyservice etc the rooms are clean but are old and in much need of repair our air conditioner did not work well but when we mentioned it to guest services they did send someone to look at it three out of the four lamps in the room did not work and the lampshades were stained and ragged there were mosquitos squashed on the wall and the ceiling in the bathroom had a small leak - so nothing to write home about but not the end of the world either the maid service was not great but they did the necessary cleaning i bathroom and floor but attention to detail like replacing the kleenex box went out the window again , we only slept in the room and made the best of the rest of our time the beach and pool areas are beautiful , there are plenty of chairs at both and despite the hotel being at full capacity , there never seemed to be a crowd the beach towel service is a little hit and miss , but if you keep trying you will get one ( keep in mind with some 1500 guests at the hotel , that 's a lot of laundry the food is reasonable at the buffet but the a la carte restaurants are better it 's not gourmet but there 's plenty of variety and for a $1000 you ca not expect cordon bleu cooking perhaps one of the best things about the resort is that you can get food 24/7 there is always a restaurant that is open your best bet for lunch is at the el mirador , the new restaurant next to the new pool - it 's a little long but the food is good and the view is spectacular there 's nothing to complain about with the alcohol , the bartenders are more than happy to give you more than you need , and the all inclusive price includes premium alcohol not just domestic brands the animation team is great but never pushy - if you want to join an activity , that 's great if you do not they leave you alone all in all a fun time , and great value for the money if you can put up with an old , tired room then it 's well worth seeing this spectacular location because once they 've finished renovating a $1000 all inclusive for a week will be a thing of the past 
good trip but watch the food we just got back from our vacation last night to barcelo we booked our vacation through selloffvacations we flew out of toronto on march 3rd the flight was pretty good everything ran smoothly the only down side we had to wake up at 1 am to get to the airport by 3 am cause our flight was 6 am if you leave try to go later as this wrecks a couple of your days because you are trying to recover from the amount of sleep you lose we flew with skyservice and they were great everyone was friendly , the only downside the plane was very very squished we were in there like sardines our arrival at punta cana was very good just watch out for those bag boys they are visous they even fight with eachother to get your bags so watch out our transportation was very good we took a nice coach bus and arrived at the resort around 1 pm let me say that once you get in the dominican and drive to your resort you will be shocked the roads are awful and everyone drives fast and honks the way the people live here is very sad aswell and let me say they treat dogs here like rodents check in ran smoothly except we had to wait till 3:30 for our room which was a bummer but we got to eat lunch right away let me say it takes getting used to everything you will find your way around everywhere eventually this resort is huge but everything is easily accesible we had the prenium class and let me say this does nothing for u the only thing u get is the 4 reservations for the a la carte restaurants and you get a special braclet which i think does nothing for you everyone gets free drinks the rooms very okay , we did not get the renovated rooms but still they were okay dont worry about the musty smell , it goes away after a few days and just leave your balcony door open for a few hours a day and you will be set to go the beds were comfy and the fridge was stocked daily the maids did a very good job and we left her a little gift when we left our room was in block 6 on floor 3 we were close by the pool which was nice you do have to walk a lot to get to your room just a little warning but its all good for you why not come home with a little weight gone it felt good now for the pools and the beach they were all amazing the beach was spectacular just watch out for the topless women which isnt too nice when your a women the beach was very clean and very pretty make sure you were tons of sunscreen atleast something over 30 spf i got burnt badly and let me say it wrecks your vacations i couldnt sleep sometimes during the night because i was burnt so bad you dont want to look like a lobster the pools were very nice and big didnt spend to much time in them but they were good they were very clean aswell you could always find chairs to sit in which wasnt a problem the bars were very good , remember to tip your bartender they basically live off your tips these people make a dollar an hour so be generous beware of the pina coladas they are a natural laxitive and if you want to spend your whole vacation in the washroom go ahead id limit myself to about 1 pina colada a day watch your drink limit the service here was very good but sometimes slow but that doesnt matter does it your on vacation you 've got plenty of time the people are very very friendly and always happy and singing the only thing i would recommend is you learn your basic spanish like hello and how are you things like that because the people here dont speak much english now for the food my biggest problem the food was awful , watch out for the meat , beware of the hotdogs and pasta do not and i warn do not eat the salami and cheese at the buffet this is what i got sick from i had to get sent to the hospital for a whole day because i got an infection of my stomach and intestines i warn you now get travel insurance or you are screwed i had to be put on iv for a whole day and now i am on 3 types of medication to settle my stomach it was not fun and very scary to spend a day in the hospital in a poor country like the dominican i do have to admit though they are very fast there you get everything you need they just dont speak english there is a doctor on the resort and i recommend if you get diarrea or feel ill go straight to the doctor do not wait it out for you will get even more sick trust me the doctor there is very good i just want to say just make sure what you are eating , do not eat something that you are not used to and just watch everything the a la carte restaurants were very good and very nice we only got to have the italian and the seafood restaurant for the 2 other ones were extreamly late and we had to cancel them now for the vendors beware of these people they will sell you stuff at way to high of a price 
decent place we just returned from a 7- night stay at barcelo punta cana we had a nice time and the barcelo had a lot to do with it the resort had some great features , but it also had some bad aspects too first the good : the pool , the beach , the entertainment team , and the service honestly , all of the above were excellent the 2 pools are large and well - maintained i loved that they were so large that you could get lost in them we would just swim around in all different directions ( but somehow we always found ourselves back at the swim - up bar the beach : this is one of the best we walked up the beach for about an hour and half to the east and i do not think any other resorts ' beach was quite as nice the barcelo 's is clean and large and just a smidge to the west the waves are huge plus there were many loungers so it was always easy to find a nice spot no review would be complete without a huge kudos to the entertainment team these people work so hard they are some of the first and last people you see on any given day and they make you have fun because they 're always having so much fun they 're really great and they always made us smile and laugh and lastly , the service i honestly ca not say we had bad service from anyone people were always happy , helpful , and working to make things better i was really pleased and for the bad : the odor , the food , the size , and some of the facilities the odor , at times , was quite strong and unpleasant i only noticed it in my room , but my room was not the source it is a strong sewer type smell one night it was so strong it woke me up i thought i might yak , but it often went away just as quickly as it came - most of the time it was tolerable the food : just not very good - you must pick your cuisine carefully : we thought we did , but we are both suffering from sammy sosa 's revenge it 's also a pain that you do not get to pick your restaurants and have to eat mostly at the buffet we did have a nice dinner at tokio and the marlin - i suspect other ala cartes were good too , but dominican restaurant ( conuco , i think ) was not very good in fact , some of it was inedible - we were served a plate of pork bones and fat - no meat the size : this place is big , maybe too big and there can be large crowds at some of the facilities when full ( swim - up bar and pool service bar are examples ) the size is also what makes it hard to eat at some of the ala carte restaurants lastly , some of the facilities i can see the maintenance crew is working hard and the number of people that use this place can wear it out faster than maintenance can keep up some things just look beat up - the lobby bars are an example , so are the ping - pong tables it just showing its age , but it is not anything that should ruin your good time i also learned that the merengue must 've been invented by dominicans trying to take a shower at the barcelo i have never jumped around so much : left , right , in , out , but , again , this place is big , so i can imagine people throughout are creating a fluctuating demand for the hot and cold water 
i so much agree with those who did not find the barcelo punta cana up to standards the service is unbelievably slow ( it took up 90 minutes to check it , can you believe it ) service at bars is only quick if you tip ( there are lots of americans and canadians there , and they always tip everybody , so bartenders have got used to it - if you tip , you get your drink , if you do not tip , you do not get your drink ) i find this system very unfair ( and it would not be acceptable in europe ) when in rome do as the romans do my room was the worst room i have ever had leaking ceiling , flooded toilet , blocked sink , tv with nearly only porno on it - can you imagine any worst the food was not good it was edible , but just about a couple we met there ( from france ) ended up in hospital with food poisoning we did not have any problems , though we were automatically booked at the a la carte restaurants at check in - the timing were crazy : once at 6 pm , the following day at 9 really silly timing the food at al la carte restaurants is better , the service still really slow ( although friendly ) meals at the buffet restaurant are sort of entertaining - you have to fight to get a table , to get your cutlery , to get your salt and pepper , to get your napkin really a nightmare and once you get your stuff , and go and get your food you come back and something is missing ( normally the salt and pepper ) because the waiters pinch it from one table to give it to the next the good points abou this hotel are the beach and the swimming pools they are really great i wanted to go to the spa but it was closed my recommendation to people intending to go to punta cana - think twice before you go to this hotel as i said , the beach and the pool are great ( and so are the drinks at the bars ) but the rest is a disaster if you are given a crap room ( like ours ) you are stuck with it - it is not easy to change room ( we tried twice , even gave a 20usd tip to the reception guy but in vain 
worst place for the money , a big time scam worst place , for the money , i ever been , in the last 20 years or so i 've been there at the end of january 2008 hotel is rated as a three star one it 's a big joke , would not fit a profile of a 2-2 5 star hotelservice is substandard : small , cheap tv set in the room , lot of fixtures broken , a lot of pay - par - view porn channels ( if you go with kid , think twice before flipping the channels , the sound is on almost always ) - very educational , especially if you go with kids , rooms full of mosquitoes , nobody speaks english ( learb\n some spanish , will go a long way there ) , the bed was in poor condition ( you could literally sink into the mattress ) , reception very polite in making empty promises , but wo not really move a finger to help , the food is barely acceptable , the bar is full of cheap local drinks ( except the paid one ) , etc , etc , etc , etc if you need more info , please write me at jcocares@yahoo price per day is outrageous , if you compare with a standard 3-3 5 star hotel on the positive side , if you get it at 50-60% of the price of a decent 3 star hotel , the deal is ok , having in view that for lower standards you pay less otherwise it 's a big scam , way too expensive for comfort and service need more info , send me and e - mail at jcocares@yahoo comcheers , jimmy 
very good value went feb 12-19th out of kitchener check in good with premium class bldg 6 4th floor ocean and pool view 4th time to p and of course beach is great only complaint if this is one is that there is only one washroom for the large pool and the ocean which is part of the restaurant awkward at meal times a - la - cartes were all good however french had slow service could not go wrong with the buffets long walk out to main road at front of resort but could take a bus to higuey for $2 met a tour guide that got on the bus and showed us the cathedrals ( new and old - new spectacular ) , markets , downtown felt worried about safety however there were beggars worth while if you want to see real dominican republic 
it was a great vacation my husband and i stayed here from january 29 to february 5th 2008 we were not sure what to expect since all the negative feedback arrive later on night we had a separete checkin which went really quickly the grounds of the resort itself were amazing beautifully groomed , constantly being worked on by the staff we took a lot of walks around the resort , and there was lots to see , and lots of paths to go on the desserts in the buffet were very extravagant with lots of variety the buffets we both already found plenty of food we liked we had reservations for the dominican restaurant service was great and food  also the paris la a carte our room was cleaned daily and always enough towels and most days she left flowers on the bed and bathroom drinks at each bar were mixed differnent but always tried to service everyone quickly overall , we had an amazing vacation , and came home with many great memories when the week was over , we wished we could stay another we went for a relaxing week and we certainly had that 
mixed feelings my husband and i stayed here from january 26 to february 2 2008 we were not sure what to expect since we usually book 5 star hotels we have holidayed in punta cana 6 times and we absolutly love the island i will break it down for you how i rated this hotel the room that we had were standard 2 double beds a dresser and a full bathroom the room was very clean but did have a musty smell to it they are renovating the hotel and we stayed in the older block which is the 500s we tipped the maids quite well but only on the last day we were there she made one small towel animal on the bathroom tap and left a small glass of flowers in the bathroom otherwise she did her job and cleaned beach : the beach was fantastic as always and the sand was soft and white there was no problem getting lounge chairs as there was plenty of them the week we were there it was quite windy and the ocean was really rough with very high waves but who cares your in the carribean the food was pretty standard but not bad the one problem we encountered was in the buffet there is not enough staff the tables were not cleaned very often and trying to find someone to get you coffee at breakfast or wine with dinner was almost impossible unless you got there right when it opened the grill at the pool is pretty good so we usually ate there there is 4 specialty restaurants but we only went to one which was the japanese and the food there was great but again the service of the waitress was not but if your hungry there is always something you can eat bars : there is seven bars in total and we had no problem getting a drink just make sure if you want alcohol you ask them or they do not put it in we tipped the bartenders quite well and they sure appreciate it all in all we went for a relaxing week and we certainly had that we will be going back to punta cana in june but we would not stay at this hotel again if you do stay here you will have a good time just have some patience 
you get better service at motel 8 than barcelo barcelo caters mostly to europeans and canadians the previous reviews i 've read here seem to be quite positive because they 're not written by americans americans tend to have different standards when it comes to hotels because we 're used to better treatment service is pretty much the essense of an all - inclusive resort and it is severely lacking at barcelo punta cana majority of the staff at the hotel acted as they were doing the guests a favor and tried their best to avoid work i 've never been to a resort where the employees worked really hard at not working i believe this attitude comes from the management at barcelo , which does not care about their customers we wanted to speak to a manager at one point and were told to make an appointment and maybe the manager will see us in the next few days i tend to overlook a lot of shortcomings if the employees try hard to please the guests but , at barcelo , the staff simply does not care roomwe stayed at building 2, which had the renovated rooms the beds were comfortable , the room had a flat - screen tv , fridge , safe and a balcony the bathroom was nice except for the leaking ceiling every time someone took a shower upstairs , water would pour through ceiling panels and recessed light fixtures talk about unsafe conditions - the floor and sink area were constatly wet and slippery plus the danger of electrocution no alarm or any clock in the room , so i set the alarm on my phone housekeepingour side of the builing was not cleaned until 5:30pm , just as the sun was setting and we came back from the beach to clean up we asked for extra towels and put 'do not disturb ' sign on our door so that we would not have to deal with the cleaning lady while changing for the evening beach  poolvery nice beach with plenty of chairs all the huts were taken by 8am , so you have to get up early if you like shade but never any shortage of chairs in the sun both pools were great food  drinki like simple and fresh food the food at the hotel was cooked to death and bland - mushy vegetables and pasta , tough meat the fresh options consisted of iceberg lettuce , green tomatoes , red onions and red cabbage my opinion on food is probably in minority because everyone else seemed to pile their plates pretty high the waiters were hard to find and getting a glass of wine or cup of coffee was a major production 90% of the dining room staff acted as if they were on vacation and could not be bothered to set up tables or refill glasses the bartenders were great and not cheap with the liquor they worked really hard as the lines at the bars were long and never - ending entertainmentthe crew worked hard to keep the atmosphere fun there was always something to do if you wanted to participate otherthere was a lot of construction at the hotel as the rooms were renovated and pool slides built , so expect lots of banging and general construction noise the employees who speak english are far and few between buy a spanish phrase book and study it because you will be very frustrated by not being able to communicate 
some good things some bad things this is quite long i vacationed at the barcelo punta cana from thursday jan 3rd until sunday the 13th with my 2 daughters , my friend , and her 2 daughters we flew with air transat , out of toronto , and had a 10 hour flight delay , of which we did not find out about until we had arrived at the airport i was told that my carry - on bag was too large to take on the plane , and was charged $110, because it put me 11 kgs over the weight restriction oddly enough , i saw bags being carried on that were of equal size or larger when i left the dominican airport , they allowed me to take it on the plane no problem , and it fit with ease in the overhead compartment we did not end up arriving to the hotel until the 4th of jan at 8am i had requested to be in a particular block , with ocean view , neither request was filled i also requested that my friend and i be beside each other , and that was fine when we arrived to our rooms , my friends room was still dirty from the previous people , and her safe was not working my room needed repairs to the toilet and both rooms were in need of remodelling we were in block 5 while speaking with other guests , anyone in block 1-3 appeared to be happy , these rooms have all been redone block 7 is the newest block , and people appeared happy there as well some people were thrilled with their maid , unfortunately , we did not have the same experience on several occassions , we had to go looking for clean towels and toilet paper the bathroom floor was not swept once in the 10 days that we were there it took 4 days , and several requests to have the safe fixed in my friends room you can pretty much guarantee on everthing being pretty much the same in the buffets , day after day we did 4 restaurants , tokyo , which was good going down , but a couple of us were ill that evening and the following couple of days paris was okay , roma was good , and the marlin was a disappointment some days while in the dining room , or at the beachside restaurant , sometimes you would be offered drinks , and sometimes you would not i found it frustrating to go for breakfast , and there was always something you were waiting for most days if you used the pool - side washrooms , there was no toilet paper the pool is amazing , and the beach is beautiful the things we liked about this resort , we really liked unfortunately , the things we did not like , would probably prevent us from going back i never felt that cleanliness was of big importance at this resort , and it left me feeling a little uneasy about things i went to the riu bachata last year in peurto plata , and felt that they put more emphasis on things being sanitary when you were about to enter the dining room , or left a washroom , there was always someone standing there with hand sanitizer something small , but something that impressed me were not that great they did bring in michael jackson one night , and that was amazing a couple of other nights were not so bad , but on the whole , not that entertaining some were great simon , from the animation team , we all loved you samuel at the front desk , also very helpful , but unfortunately , we did not meet him until our last day juan carlos at the front desk , is also pretty good our air transat rep ( adrianna ) , at our request , was able to help us get a complimentary room for our late check - out we were not leaving the hotel until 6:40 pm we were very happy to be able to keep our things locked up , and to be able to shower and change before leaving the room we were given was very large , but not clean at all it left me wanting to get out of there fairly quickly the weather when we arrived was terrible , but beyond that first day , it was perfect all in all , in spite of the things that we were not happy with , we all had a good vacation , with lots of rest and relaxation if you do visit this hotel , you need to be firm at the front desk if you have any problems 
worst holiday ever my husband and i booked our 2 week holiday to what was then known as superclub breezes in june 2006 i usually would not leave negative feedback unless it was serious it has taken a long time for me to write my review as i have still not total recovered from my stay , that being 18 months ago the hotel itself seemed pleasant and the staff attentive , and the rooms nice and spacious , however my husband soon became ill from the food or maybe the bottled water as i have read one guest complain of after a full day in bed he felt a little better , although i soon did not start to feel well with stomach pains and diahorrea once we returned back to the uk i was admitted to hospital and remained ill for 6 months , with doctors unable to diagnose the problem i am still experienceing stomach problems from the holiday now it 's 18 months later and i am writting this in the hope that if you have a dicky tummy to begin with you will not go to this hotel we have no doubt that it was the food there , and as one other reviewer said i can well believe that cockroaches were running around the dinner plates as we found many in our room i hope that this review will stop someone experiencing what i have been through 
do not waste your money we had the unfortunate experience of staying at this hotel for 2 days as our flight had been delayed our holiday and wedding were at the riu bambu which was excellent and in comparison to the barcelo is no where in the same league we arrived at the barcelo and were allocated a ground floor room in block 6 this is quite a walk with your cases although there are porters to help if you if the reception staff relay the message that is our room was small and dated which was fine as due to the delay we were all shattered , however the patio did not lock as it had quite obvioulsy been forced open previously and never fixed being on the ground floor this was a great worry to me and my husband had to wedge the door with a chair and a clothes airer the next morning we ventured down to the restaurant after being spoiled at the bambu with hot , fresh food and an immaculately clean restaurant i was disgusted by the amount of flies in the restaurant , i was very careful to stick to porridge and rolls which were covered as anything that was not sealed had flies landing on it the snack bar was the same and the pool area too in my book flies means dirty , it was down to cleanliness and after spending 2 weeks at the bambu where i cannot remember being bothered by any flies at all i had to wonder to myself what the food preperation areas were like and how the problem had become so bad the other issues in this hotel are queues , on christmas day i spent 20 mins queuing for a plate of pasta from the pasta bar , the only thing i dared to eat as it was cooked fresh as you waited also queues at the bars , which are made worse by other guests being rude and trying to push in this does not make for a relaxing atmosphere , combined with the fact that when my husband got to the bar there was no water or sprite all they had was coke which they were pouring into glasses so full of ice you only got one mouthfull of pop also the queues are made worse by the fact that food is not filled up as soon as it has ran out and you found that by the time anything had been filled up there were that many people waiting for it that it had ran out again my annoyance with this may have been due to the fact that the staff at the bambu were brilliant and always checking if anything was running low the hotel looks wonderful from a distance but when you get close you see the cracks also meant literally around the pool area which was lovely but had not been looked after , and there were missing tiles dotted all around the pool and the centre area had more grout all over the tiles than what was holding them in place in my mind small things like this make the difference and this hotel definately lacked the finishing touches also look out for all the wet floor signs from the ceiling leaks i think on one trip back to our room i counted five do not come to this hotel if you want to relax , you cannot relax at dinner for all the flies wanting to share your food with you , you cannot relax at night for fear of your room being broken into , and you cannot relax when getting a drink because of the queue jumpers an awful hotel that i have no idea how it got it 's four stars 
a good vacation but some problems given the other reviews we did not have high expectations for our trip to the barcelo premium but we did have some expectations given the four apple rating this property received from apple vacations ( who we booked through ) on the whole we did have a good time but there were a number of issues that may put off many people we feel this resort is quite average and compared to the two gran bahia principe all inclusive properties we have visited this resort pales in comparison ( i realize the two should not be directly compared as we payed about 30% less for the barcelo premium ) so first the good points : the beach is one of the best that i 've ever seen if you want to walk along the beach and just generally chill out in or around the ocean beautiful soft sand and very clean this was the highlight of our vacation the pool and pool area were nice and kept clean bars were good and generally had good service make sure to try a mama juana pina colada quick run down of a la cart restaurants : dominican - we loved the soups and mafongo seafood was very overcooked and did not taste all that fresh the guinea hen was generally good service was a bit strange as related later overall we 'd recommend this restaurant as a way to try some dominican cuisine italian - food was good for this resort but not of any great quality you 'll get much better food at an olive garden service was good try the champagne ( applies to all locations in resort ) as i thought it was much better than the included red and white wines french - we ate here twice and had generally good experiences the best dish we had was the salmon there is a cheese bar at the this restaurant food was highly variable but generally good recommendedjapanese/tepanyaki - if you have never had tepanyaki ( show grilling ) than you 'll probably love this restaurant if you 've been to other tepanyaki restaurants you 'll probably be disappointed with the show aspect chef tried very hard but it was obvious that he had not received very much training food was pretty good and was some of the best during our stay recommended but do not expect too much from the show sake is available and is of ok quality issues : ( it 's going to sound like i 'm complaining a lot here but this is what we experienced , some of it bothered us , some of it did not , consider how it would impact you ) water : water pressure , hot and cold water fluctuated throughout our stay many days we did not have any hot water , sometimes we did not have any running water , and other times we only had scalding hot water electricity : there were several power outages during our stay this also contributed to the water problems highly variable service : the service that we experienced at this resort was highly variable some of this was at times due to language barrier since our spanish is minimal that said we ran into some great individuals and some that were so poor that we could not believe it maid service and mini bar service were generally quite good front desk service was poor to ok service at the bars was generally good and restaurant service varied wildly this resort needs to work on consistency of service perhaps one of the worst experiences was at the dominican restaurant we were seated and a gentleman came to take our orders we had questions about the menu and asked about what was in different items he would explain what was in an item but then assume we wanted it , writing it down we would then ask about another item and he would look annoyed because he had to change what he had written this went on for a few minutes and we finally had everything figured out and he repeated everything back to us including our drink selections he left and after about ten minutes we still only had water at our table and the first course arrived during the whole meal the person who took our order along with three or four other individuals were standing in the corner of the restaurant doing nothing when the waiter arrived with the first course he looked at us puzzled and asked if we wanted any drinks despite speaking less english than the person who took our order he was able to get the drink orders correct , we watched him go ahead and make the drinks himself , while the others stood around , and brought them back to us within a few minutes we watched as he took care of almost every aspect of service for everyone in the restaurant while his coworkers just stood there this lead to generally slow service because he was forced to do everything we were dumbfounded by the lack of effort displayed by the other individuals and so it goes that we had some of the best and worst service in the same restaurant at the same time i believe this is a stellar example of what barcelo needs to correct front desk/restaurant issues : when we checked in we were handed three receipts with prebooked restaurant reservations there was no concern for when or where we wanted to eat we wanted to change these reservations immediately after we saw them but the front desk refused to do so we ended up getting to try a number of restaurants but because of this system we did not get to try the seafood restaurant that we had wanted to i complained to guest services and they told me the bookings could be changed at check him i indicated the front desk had not let us do so one of a number of examples of different policies being followed by different individuals overall the restaurant booking system would work if they allowed you to change the reservations at check in but this was very much a point of annoyance because of the way it was handled food quality : i think i can sum this up by saying that after getting back to the usa we enjoyed eating at hardee 's the food quality and variety was generally not very good we never went hungry but given the apple rating of this resort we expected better the food ( with some exceptions ) was not even of the quality we would expect from an old country buffet or similar here in the states this was unfortunately true in both the a la carte restaurants and the buffet variety was minimal and we were sick of the buffet by the last day despite having eaten at a la carte restaurants for dinner on five nights sometimes we were just baffled by what we received , the best example being a fish terrine appetizer we ordered when it arrived it turned out to be what looked to us like fish and chips ( fried fish sticks and french fries ) finally on the food front is that during our stay both myself and my wife developed digestive issues including diarrhea we are not sure what caused the problems but the issues persisted significantly after leaving the dr we have traveled quite a bit including mexico , china , thailand , and numerous other places and this was by far the worst food related problems that we have had we never drank anything except bottle water so this was not directly water related room issues : air conditioning was very loud ( but worked well ) and the toilet ran continuously which contributed to ambient noise levels we decided this might be a good thing as once we had people in the rooms adjacent to ours we realized it was easy to hear what was going on in other rooms during our stay we also had a major water leak from the room above into our bathroom this resulted in our bathroom being mostly unusable until the problem was resolved that said maintenance fixed this problem relatively quickly and the issue did not recur 
get the suite - you 'll be in heaven we stayed at this resort for a few days in late november for a friend 's wedding and it was a great time right off the bat i 'd recommend that you spend a little extra ( it 's not much more ) on the suite rooms - they are fantastic , huge king bed , balcony , living room , surrounded by marble - we had a party of three in there comfortably with the fold out bed couch i loved the little plate of desserts and complimentary glass - bottled sodas they 'd resupply each day the good : the pool is huge , with different areas to explore , including a wading section , volleyball area and an impressive tiki - hut thatched roof above the expansive swim - up bar plenty of lounge chairs in every direction friendly service all - around , including the bartenders this resort is big you have to walk around quite a bit to get to places the buffets were about average , sometimes missing the mark on something like marinara sauce where you can notice ketchup was used to stretch it we gave them the benefit of the doubt most of the food was pretty good the ambiental music is on throughout most the day but they seem to take breaks now and then some resorts just blast it nonstop make sure to hit the cigar shop on - premise - we picked up a large box of cohibas for about us $200 which is a steal they have a few ping pong tables woo - hoo and a dance club which could use a good power - washing ( it reeked of something gone wild ) the best amenity is the 24 hour oceanside sports bar adjacent to the 24 hour snack hut a few nights we gave them a good run there 's stuff like rock wall climbing , a trapese area , on - beach massages , parasailing , horseback riding , bike rentals , tennis courts plenty of activity here the beach was very pleasant , white sand , water in the tropical blue hues you see as described - the water was a bit choppy , although refreshing the not so good : check - in seemed to take a while from the too - relaxed staff a slight inconvenience : no hot water at all ( showers ) we did not complain because everything else was just right and suites we 're sold out and we did not want to give ours up tv reception is bad , not that we went down to watch tv but c 'mon , get with it the japanese steak restaurant , tokyo , tries hard to approximate the benihana experience - just do not compare the two side by side all the food was freshly cooked in front of you , but it all tastes like soy sauce , whether shrimp , beef , chicken or fish the tempura appetizer looked like children 's school erasers they were so tiny oh and we had two power outages during our meal which was both awkwardly amusing and slightly disconcerting that experience led us to try the sake , which led us to try the wines , which brought us back to the saftey drink , cuba libre whatever the italian restaurant is named - roma , or michaelangelo 's , is of similar quality - so - so if you 're staying during the weekend be prepared for major traffic as the resort allows locals to come in and hang out around the pool , drink it up and win the maracca dance contest these are fixed so that the dominican ladies always beat out the touristas someone should complain , but with a tan and pina colada replacing your vital fluids after a few days , does it really matter you 'll have the chance to buy paintings , carvings , necklaces and all sorts of island - inspired knick - knacks be sure to bargain if that 's in you 're nature , my one friend bought a sculpture at 50% of the artist 's asking price bottom line : this place is worth a stay , the service if great , the facility is up to par and they do go out of their way to accomodate 
worst hotel and vacation ever my husband and i just returned and we will never go back again check in was a nightmare , they are so rude at the front desk the first room they put us in had water pouring through the ceiling all over the bed , when we asked to change they looked at us like we were crazy , they put us in a second room and the bathroom toilet above us leaked into our bathroom , so we had to be moved again , and they only did that after i started screaming and yelling the third room they put us in smelled so bad , it was damp the whole time we were there in the room all of our clothes were constantly wet we had either no water or no hot water , the toilets would not flush , there were ants all over the mini bar and all i did was chase those huge cockaroaches around the room to kill them the minibar was all rusted inside and out , i had to beg for a washcloth and a pillow they actually went into the room next door to me and took a pillow off their bed and had the nerve to hand that to me we had to constantly call to have the room cleaned the room was absolutely disgusting we never took our clothes out of the suitcases and put the suitcases high up on a chair , no where near the floor the food was horrible , only tokio food was great , everything else was disgusting , there were flies all over the buffets , birds were flying in and walking around near the bread in the marlin rest , the utensils were filthy , the salt and pepper shakers had rusted tops , all the bathrooms in all the restaurants were backed up and stayed that way until we left the staff that works there are nasty and rude everything was in spanish , they also let the locals in on the weekends and cater to them , so forget about getting near any of the food , they are all on top of it , and the locals let their children swim in the pool in their underwear , i never went in the pool , it was gross the three stores they have there are ridiculously expensive they are very money hungry this was not a safe feeling hotel at all we got no sleep at all , the doors on the rooms are all cracked and are paper thin , we just could not wait to go home the best part of this place was the beach that is it , you ca not order drinks with the staff because they do not understand what you are saying it is horrible my husband and i went on the horse back riding excursion and they took us by horse through the back of the hotel through all the workers , through construction debris and garbage through the woods it stunk like urine to a path that led to the beach look i know this was a cheap vacation , but come on it was horrible do yourself a favor and go somewhere else but not here 
not a good idea to stay here this hotel is highly over rated and i would not recommend staying here i met a couple last week on an aircraft considering staying here and they begged me to go on this site and write about my experiences the following are issues we had with the resort : * check in was disorganised , we wait 1 hour to get our room when we received our room there were no towels or face cloths we had to beg for these two items * i originally booked the hotel as a breezes resort and it was classified as a 4 1/2 star and it is barely a three star * the evening show is not worth attending * the rooms are old , the beds were hard and old , the room was also infested with ants we were told after the infestation not too leave food in the room i bars and candy there is also a mold problem in the rooms * dinner reservations were made for us and when we tried to change it we were not accomadated - unless we lined up for an hour the food was good and it is the only reason i 'm giving this hotel an okay rating there are so many more beautiful hotels in this region do yourself a favour and pick another hotel this hotel is good for a group of college students looking for a cheap holiday overall , i believe the barcelo hotel is a cheap hotel 
we visited this resort for 7 days we chose this resort because it was marketed to be child friendly if you have children i would not recommend they stay up past 8:00 to see the entertainment it was bizarre and wierd men were dressed as women flys were always at the buffett and sitting on the food service was a whatever attitude front desk does not understand a word you are saying on the plus side the beach is awesome i the beach is the most beautiful this resort has a large beach with plenty of room the water was beautiful blue and the sand was so pretty we took a taxi to the resort from the airport the drivers were all so very nice i loved the airport it had a tropical feel to it i will go every year to punta cana but i do not think we will stay at this resort again for some reason it was really hard to get washcloths you may want to bring your own make sure you take a shower before everyone else does ( no hot water ) take fabric softner sheets so your clothes will smell good take sunscreen and a hat 
horrible dont do it we went to punta cana for 10 days maybe for some people it would be an ok place to stay , but for my family we are use to cruises which is the only way to go ( so this could not compare the hotel was in the process of being remodeled so it was kind of a mess , things were stacked everwhere , our bathroom ceiling was leaking ( and we had a suite no one there spoke any english so if god for bid any thing happened to you they have no idea how to help you if you ask for a spoon you get a glass of juice the food is very dominican based even in the buffet the desserts are nasty and the fruit has no taste the resort itself is not enclosed so birds and bugs are constantly flying in and landing all over the table and food the excursions are way overpriced and so are the stores they have vendors that come every tuesday and thursday and try to sell their beaded necklaces which they try to charge $50- way overpriced then if you say no they 'll stalk you until you buy it so avoid them at all costs if you go on an excursion , eat before and drink plenty of bottled water my dad passed out because it was so hot and there was nothing to eat also bring plenty of singles because you have to tip everyone the tv only gets about 5 channels in english and dont expect any entertainment the person that served you lunch will be the same person dancing for you later that night the beach is pretty but the waves are brutal so unless you 're an expert swimmer do not bother going in the ocean in general this vacation stunk i would recommend royal caribbean cruises all the way 
stay away from this place this was the vacation from hell the only good thing i have to say about this hotel is that the beach was indeed beautiful , but , the rest was from just downright horrible to bad first , stop the merengue music if you think you will be able to take a nap in the room after a nice couple of hours at the beach , think again there was constant and loud ( i mean really loud ) merengue music and noice constantly from 10am to 11pm it was impossible to be in the room and watch tv or just take a nap we had a nice oceanview room but due the the constant loud music , we were forced to be out of the room until they finally shut up the music at 11pm every night we came home even more tired than we got there apparently the hotel staff assumes that everyone wants to hear that merengue music ( and by the way , the same music every day seems the dj only had one cd ) all day we asked for a room change but the room they gave us was worse that the original one the property is shaped as a horseshoe with the theater and the mega speakers right in the middle by the pool , so there is no escaping the noise if you want a place to relax , dont stay here if you are looking to party all day and night , then fine the food was ok no fresh fruit juices all from concentrate or powdered drinks were terrible they cant fix a daiquiri or margarita to save their lives they just mix whatever looks like what you are asking and thats it we also got some kind of stomach virus there bottomline dont stay at this hotel save yourself the agony and the staff could not care less 
maybe its gone downhill since the name change , but we liked it we stayed at the breezes punta cana in late december 2005 - january 2006 and enjoyed it , but not to say it was perfect the goodtransportation from the airport was organised , check in was fairly efficient and before long we were in our spartan room overlooking the pool area the mattresses were hard and it did smell a little musty but you get used to it the food at the buffet restaurant was pretty good but repetitious themes - german , italian , mexican , german , italian , mexican , etc the theme restaurants were very good however - french , italian , dominican and japanese - although i felt ill after the japanese meal plan on getting up early to book as they fill up fast the beach was great with lots of room for everyone and if you ignore the sunken debris plastic bottles , cups , sunglasses , goggles etc , the water was quite nice a warning to the puritanical , you 'll find a lot of topless women here both young and old , this is not a bad thing kids quickly get used to it and you will to you can also rent a catamaran , atv 's , take a helicopter tour or go parasailing among other services did not use them so i ca not comment if it was worth the money , seemed expensive to me note to canadians , there is a way cool outdoor hockey rink with sticks and skates , albeit they 're either worn out or broken the rink surface is not ice - obviously - but you can put skates on or runners , and it 's hockey night in the dr inside the hotel was a large shelf unit were people left newspapers , books , magazines from the world over to share them with others the staff were very nice , despite the language barrier breezes claims this to be a tip free resort , but like it or not it brings the extra service some people on this forum complained about staff being rude , perhaps these are the same people i observed treating staff like cattle , you get what you give the not so goodwhile looking for the orientation session the day after arrival a seemingly nice employee offered to help us strangely he handed us a mickey of harsh dominican rum and started pressuring us to attend an information session , and then it dawned on us yep , he was one of those time share guys , so be aware they lurk near the front entrance dressed in khaki , avoid eye contact and keep walking the pool staff - while acknowledging they have a job to do - were annoying as hell doing the same damn theme with the same damn songs every day it got old fast did they know some of those songs they played the lyrics were not exactly family friendly at night do not wander too far of the hotel via the beach or men with guns will strongly suggest you head back i assume ( hope ) these guys are employed by the hotel the nightly shows were kind of corny song and dance stuff , not very well done but the spirit was there and hey , is not that the busboy from the buffet restaurant dancing out of step and mouthing the wrong lyrics at the end of the chorus line some people got their kicks torturing us by allowing their children to stage a musical with help from the staff to anybody who is thinking of doing this please do not according to my ( then ) five year old the kids camp was crap because the lady in charge sqaushed a little crab crossing the sidewalk which upset a number of kids maybe it 's me but those tooth rotting sugary drinks were over the top , even my kids got sick of them there is a feeling of isolation here , you can only swim so much , suntan , or walk along the beach for so long sometimes you got to go beyond the hotel gates but besides other hotels behind large walls , there is really nothing else to see the nearby towns are nothing to look at crowded , polluted and full of aggressive merchants there are a number of bus trips available outside the gates , in particular we had a blast on an 18 hour marathon trip to and from santo domingo , the driver and the tour guide were great and made the trip eventful the dominican republic and it 's capitol are beautiful but you also discover how poor this country and it 's people before arriving we considered renting a car to explore , until i saw how they drive dilapidated cars passing on the shoulder , vintage two stroke motorcycles driven by people with no helmets usually carrying children , crappy roads , and little signage to speak of seriously do not rent a car in this country they laundry service was quite expensive so we opted to clean our clothes in the tub and hang them out to dry big mistake , as no amount of hanging will ever make them dry in this humid environment worst of all are the merchants selling overpriced trinkets on the hotel grounds , and almost anywhere tourists congregate be warned , if you 're a women or a child they may not take no for an answer things you should knowi 'll spare the usual list of toiletries to bring as we all know the drill on that but , do not pay full price on anything from the merchants , too often i saw other guests paying full price without question overall though a pretty good family oriented place and i would recommend going back despite the bad reviews 
worst vacation ever i just want to start by saying that my boyfriend and i are very easy going people , not hard to please i few weeks before we left , i emailed the hotel and asked for a room with a ocean view and close to the pool i wanted something special since we were having our two year aniversary the problems started right off the bat we went to check in at 11:30 along with about ten others from our bus there was no direction at the front desk as to where you needed to go and to whom you needed to speak with we waited in line for ten minutes only to be told we had to go other side of counter once we were finally given our room number , we were told to chack back in at two to see if it was done we did a few things and we to see our room and at 12:30 the maid was going in to clean we went back to the front desk an hour later and asked if room was done and was told no by now we have been up and traveling 12 hours and were tired we asked for another room and were told no and to check back in at three we saw many other people check in and get their room right a way by three i finally had to state that i know the room was clean , we saw her doing it at 12:30, at that point we finally got it once in the room , it was not much to have waited over three hours for it smelled damp and musty the light in the bathroom were falling out and the door was falling apart at the bottom the room needed to be updated in a big way we went to the tokyo for dinner , great show but i got very sick half hour after dinner i never had stomach and lower abdominal pain like i did that whole night from that moment on we were both sick the whole week we could 'nt keep anything we did not drink the water except the ice in our drinks besides from being very sick all we , the staff was very slow and not helpful it was very hard to find a smile thursday night we throught we would try the paris , we actually had good service ( first time all week ) again , i was severly sick all night and thats when i saw the roachs there were three i watched from my bed as they crawled along the floor in the morning we speok to the maid about it and she had the room sprayed after thay , the room smelled so bad we asked for another and were told no , that the smell would be gone shortly we finally decided to see the doctor after being sick for four days he was nice but told us not to drink fluids but to go to his clinic if we have insurance to have an iv we decided to pay the five dollars for gatorade to help replenish oh , do not want to forget about the on going construction they built an ugly wall arounf the mexican res and the ampitheater and decided to take both down that 's all you heard all day long , was the bounding along with that were the working walking around and the load down trucks going around the pool area after this an much more , we decided to call our agent and come home a few days early since we went through apple , we had to use our rep at the hotel we tried to find him from 8:30 to 10 to catch a 12:30 flight home but could not we ended up having to make the best of it , sick as dogs for the next to days e decided not to eat anything or drink anything but water and gaterade we have traveled to alot of places and never been treated so badly or became so sick i mentioned to the hotel in our survey to check their filtration system we are going back to apple with our photos of the bug , lights etc to get our money back 
hotel from helll to whom it may concern : this letter is to give detail account of my horrible experience staying at the barcelo punta cana in the dominican rep the dates scheduled for my vacation were from aug 21st till the 28th , i am writing this letter from new york my home which is the result of me having to cut the my vacation short do to the rudeness , unhygienic and overall filthiness of this hotel from the moment i walked into the hotel it took hours for the hotel receptionist to check me in to my room , while being completely obnoxious as to apposed to greeting a new guest with open arms the room had mold and it had an urine oder to it , the safe was damaged and i requested for it to be changed or fixed every day that i was there but maintenance never showed up even though the hotel reception would scheduled and asked me to wait for them , what made it worse was the fact that reception would hang the bathroom had a leak in the faucets and the ceilings no maintenance ever showed up to fix any of the hotel room problems while they would ask me to wait for some one in the room when this is spoused to be a vacation the oder of the mattress and the pillows were so unbearable to the point that i laid out towels to even be able to lay down , there were insects from ants to water bugs that kept me up late at night scared i asked for a change of room and was told that there was a waiting list the food that this hotel provided for its guest was undercooked and tasted as if it was reheated from several days ago , the fruits were not fresh at all on thursday the 23rd i ate something that gave me food poisoning i was vomiting through out the night till the point that i could not hold any liquids in my stomach and of course there was no one from the hotel to assist me , thats when i had enough and called my husband to book a flight out of this hotel which i and many other guest feel was from hell my husband and i had to now pay an extra $300 dollars to get a flight so that i can get home and receive proper medical attention result of all this is that i now had lost my vacation time from my job , $940 00 for a paid all inclusive dream resort vacation and a $300 early flight fee in total i have lost time value and about $1,300 not including medical fees i am outraged as to how barcelo punta cana treated me as their guest and their services which were below standards of roadside motel , i must be reimbursed or given a credit for the above stated losses 
great beach but poor service hotel we stayed in barcelo punta cana in august 11th to19th we boght that vacation package from apple vacations through the agent everything went smooth - flight , transfer and ride to the hotel but the front desk was incredibly incapable to do anything there was a mess i have never seen in my long travel life - huge line with no movement forward , no fans above that line - only above front desk it took us 2 hours to get to front desk and they told us to wait another hour becouse the room was not ready so we got room around 6 pm in fact , i saw same big line of travelers even late nights every day what kind of service is this we had a room with no water pressure in the shower water was just dripping from a shower but ran good from fauset so we took shower using empty bottles from spring water - that was much better than go back to front desk our calls to get repair had no any result beach was really great , no seeweeds , very clean beautiful with warm water swimming pool is huge clean warm there is always enogh shade for everyone food was ok , i would say average i loved entertainment - shows were funny , they have good dancers , but too small theater so some people could not find a seat room service was very good but they always came in about 2 or 3 pm when we like to stay in on the last day after checkout which took us almost 2 hours again we discover that hurricane dean came near and all flights were cancelled we were lucky to have apple representative petra who stayed with us whole day giving us information and even gave us free room to stay untill we got picked up thanks a lot petra 
great time w/family , horrible time w/hotel  i 'm glad i have such a great time with my family no matter where i 'm at , cause this place was one thing after another when i checked in at 7pm , i notice that the cable was broken , the back door lock was broken ( and i had a 1 year old child w/me ) , the toilet was broken ( you had to put your arm in elbow deep into the tank to flush it every time you used it ) and best of all the a/c was broken i made the front desk aware of the problems that night and waited i had called them to remind them that morning that no one had come yet and twenty - four hours later , the problem had not even been looked at they finally had to switch my room only because i insisted i think the front desk manager wanted to leave me there the pool bar staff a manuela had the personality of a laxative if she was polite or smiled once i think it would have been to much i tried tipping her my first two times ( tipping is not required ) but soon realized that her crudeness did not deserve a dime the rest of the wait staff was pretty much a give and take , some good some bad the beach was gorgeous and the food was o the is not one of those resorts that someone would say , i want to return here we will definitly be looking elsewhere in punta cana when we return next year 
2nd trip to punta cana and we stayed here this is my review of our stay at barcelo punta cana from july 21st to july 28th 2007 it is important to mention that this is our 2nd consecutive trip to the dominican republic so we do have something to compare it to we stayed at melia caribe last year we traveled this time around with another couple and we are all aged between 30 and 40 lets break it down check - in is a complete nightmare i just don?? get if it?? the fact that they put complete morons behind the counter or it?? just the way they operate but from the day we got there to the day we left , all i saw from morning to night was aggravated people in line waiting to be served for their rooms or whatever other reason they were there bring your bathing suit in your handbag so you can change and hit the pool cause you will wait a long time for your room when you get there score : 1/5the rooms are ok i was disappointed with the constant smell of humidity though i don?? know if it has anything to do with our location (2nd floor , section 7) but after a day , all our clothes , sheets and pillows had that smell on the other hand , the rooms were cleaned daily with clean sheets and towels and the floors washed tip daily 1 or 2 dollars you can also leave for the maids small dollar store gifts like cosmetics , nylons , beauty products etc and stuff for kids like toys , crayons and coloring books you can also leave a small tip in the fridge fro extra beers or a mickey of rum score : 2 5/5the pool is very nice and big with lots of chairs all around and music and animation all day a fun place to retire after a long day on the beach score : 4/5the restaurants are ok we actually found the buffet better than some the japanese restaurant was good but blazing hot inside also , you cant reserve from your room you have to show up at 9:00 am at the front desk to reserve but again , because of the monkeys behind the counter , good reservation time and availability can be hard to get score : 3/5the beach is definitely the main attraction of this resort cool and clean white sand , lots of chairs and huts for the sun , beautiful clear water with nice waves which can get pretty big take a walk to the left of the resort and take a dip in front of the new resort under construction for nice waves and crystal water , just beautiful btw , does anyone know what the new resort will be score : 5/5the staff is friendly and work very hard for very little money although i speak but a few words of spanish , communication was not a problem most of the staff talks ok english but take the time to learn a few key words before leaving , they will appreciate the effort hola , servesa and cuba libr? were my 3 favorites bring a stack of american dollars for tip , i brought 30 which was plenty for 1 week after a few tips , bartenders and waiters will recognize you and get you anything you need smiles , quick service , drinks and food all done very well score : 4/5there?? also a nightly show , a casino , disco etc but these things weren?? for us so no comment on that we rather enjoyed some good conversation and drinks in the main lobby after dinner theres also a bunch of activities and trips you could do but for 100$ saona is incredible do it , i mean it , you will never forget it and the color of the water is breathtaking? there?? probably alot more i could add but i??l let you discover that for yourself although the beach is beautiful and we had a pleasant stay , i don?? think i would return to barcelo just because i??e seen better at the melia last year we intend on going big for our next trip to the dr and try either samana , paradisius or cap cana 
room for improvement , but overall enjoyable i went to barcelo from july 28 - august 4 with a friend overall , we had a nice trip , but did run into a few snags first of all , i had made arrangements through the resort for transportation via email i was given a confirmation number and was told that there would be someone there with a sign with my name on it so after being shuffled from through about 3 different people at the gate , someone shoved us into a taxi with someone who did not speak any english at all luckily another family rode with us and the husband spoke enough spanish to confirm we were going to the right resort let me advise you , if at all possible , avoid the taxi 's that was the scariest ride of my life check in : pretty quick we did not arrive with a tour , so the line was not that long we did have to wait on our room to finish being cleaned , but we got there around 2:30, and check in was 4:00 so , no complaints there room : we were put in a suite in building 7, which i was told had been recently remodeled i do not think my standards are all that high , but i was disappointed the ceiling in the bathroom was warped and sinking some of the fixtures had rust on them on wednesday , i noticed that after about 3 minutes in the shower , a foul odor that smelled like sewage was seeping up through the drain and to top things off , a middle of the night bathroom trip was interrupted by a light fixture crashing to the counter and onto the floor with glass shattering everywhere maintenance came to fix it , and the glass was not replaced , he just reattached the metal ring around the light our air condition definitely could have been colder we had it set on the lowest temperature and still could not get comfortable we also had issues with the lock on the door into the room it would not lock properly and we had to jiggle it everytime we left the room i mentioned it to the maintenance man who came to fix the light , but he just left it i later mentioned it to guest services and they were suppose to send someone up , and never did we decided on tuesday that we would just deal with it the rooms are the main problem there is definite room for improvement not exceptional , but we could always find something to eat the grill hut by the marlin was good mornings , you can have made to order omelets and in the afternoon , you have a choice of pork chops ( awesome ) , burgers or kabobs we only were able to get reservations at 2 a la cartes the pre - arranged reservations done by the resort were for late in the evening , so we ended up eating at the alcazar buffet most nights on monday we ate at tokio the food was amazing , but dress for heat there is no air condition and the heat was so bad that a girl at our table almost passed out and her family had to leave the restaurant before they could even order we had an 9:00 reservation , did not eat until almost 10:00 and not the best italian i 've eaten i ordered the lasagna and only ate a couple bites my friend ordered a pasta dish with lobster and she said it had a funny taste as well now as far as the alcazar most of the staff was nice , had a few that were rude look for hipolito he is a young man with swet personality and a great smile ( we called him smiley ) you also must check out the pasta bar it was better to me than the pasta at roma bars : best one was the lobby bar near the aphitheater and paris restaurant ask sander to make you a dominican flag best drink we had all week the bartenders at this bar were the friendliest and made the best drinks we did not go to the swim up bar because we spent all week on the beach it sounded like the people there were having a great time with some games so i 'd check it out the bar in the back of the marlin was not that good drinks were bad and bartenders at lunch were not friendly at all night time staff was much better my advice , if you want reservations at the a la cartes , get to the front desk very early we tried between 8:30 and 9:00 and most were already booked up beach : absolutely the most gorgeous i 've seen we spent everyday there i had read that it was hard to find a hut , but we never had a problem and we usually got to the beach between 8:00 and 9:00 the water is so clear and the prettiest shade of blueish - green pool and grounds : very nice the guys working the towel bar were always nice and greeted you with a smile activities : a lot to choose from we went parasailing one day a definite thing to try although , for $40 usd , i would like to have been able to stay a little longer but i have no regrets we also went to the spa for facials and massages i absolutely recommend that entertainment : we did not participate in the daytime activiites , but the evening shows were enjoyable we saw an african show , an international musical/dance show , and a fever night which was a tribute to the 70's and disco the rendition of the village people singing macho man was hilarious we wanted to see the circus , but that was the night that we went to roma and missed out i suggest watching you will most likely meet a very tall guy who is involved in the entertainment named jean claudio overall , we had a nice trip for the most part , the staff was pretty friendly 
honey moon of our nightmares we had our honeymoon at breezes , what a mistake the staff were ok , but the acommodations what about the bathroom 's roof falling on your head and the furniture that seems to came from a salvation army store but nothing was worst than the food everything included but we preferred to eat nothing but dry nachos are you looking for drunk and ugly people with a lot of cheap drinks on their heads you found the right place good luck if you choose it , but i will never return to any breezes , next time i will stay in brazil 
beautiful beach the only problem with the barcelo resort is the food it 's really not good the beach is absolutely beautiful the rooms are not fancy but clean and fine people working there were very friendly most of the other guests seemed to be from central and south america and parts of the us where people are native spanish speakers the shows at night were in spanish - interesting and not a problem the resort area is very nice we took a group of graduating high school seniors and they had a blast the casino and disco were hot spots the resort is made up of several hotels in an enclosed very large compound - and we did not feel a need to venture out it would really improve the quality of the resort if they would improve the food 
beautiful , great time , but hospitality is awful we stayed at the barcelo punta cana ( premier ) from july 12th - 20th it was me , my husband , son age 12, daughter age 8, my sister and her husband and daughter age 14, son age 13 we had no trouble with check - in , though we arrived at 1pm and did not get our room until approx but they gave us our bands , we ate lunch and the kids changed into their bathing suits and we got to enjoy the time while waiting rooms : we were in room 5210 the rooms are small but very clean though upgrades to bathroom tiles are needed they are musty smelling and everything gets damp from the high humidity the air worked just fine as we needed to turn it down as we were freezin my sister was in 3425 - her room was smaller but same upgrades needed and when it rained they had a leak in their bathroom ceiling one day they had a small lake in there but thankfully it was there last day  nothing got ruined the towel situation was horrible our rooms were cleaned around the same time everyday noonish or so however 1 day we had to request towels got them about 1 hr later and the 1 day we had to request towels 2x by phone and 2x by a visit to the front desk by my husband we finally got them 2 1/2 hrs after our first request my sister went thru the same thing the day before and speaking w/ a guest 2 doors down , they 'd been using their pool towels because they 've been requesting for 2 days so that leads to why they were running short of pool towels beach/pool : absolutely the best beach i 've been to many beaches , cancun , cabo san lucas , riveria maya , jamaica , bermuda , puerto rico , california , va beach and nj shore punta cana beaches by far is the best beach i 've ever seen oh and by the way i never go in the ocean - i spent hours in this ocean like a pool w/ a soft sand bottom the pool was excellent as well i am amazed it was cool  refreshing every day the tiles are hot and slippery - so be careful the entertainment was funny and meet juan , he 's the best restaurants : you must be a food snob if you ca not find something you like to eat we loved every meal breakfast there was plenty of everything and loved their pastries lunch at the grill was also great we ate at paris ( this was our least favorite as it was hot and guys had to wear long pants ) if its not air conditioned ( this was open air ) shorts should be allowed as it made it extremely uncomfortable but we enjoyed our dinners tokyo was so much fun and the food was awesome we all loved the fried ice cream , too roma was also good i had lasagna in dr - and it was great great breads  tiramisu el marlin was nice , we like to eat outside and we had 1/2 lobster yummy kids had ribs and they melted in your mouth the dinner buffet was great as well try the pasta station - we eat their 4 nites and got pasta 3x and it was the best again you must really be a food snob if you ca not find somthing to eat oh - and as other said about the flies none laying on the food yes there is flies around , but not bad at all my niece did get the big d 1 nite and so did i , but u ca not go by me as i have ibs and that can flare up just being out of sorts other than that we were fine a quick note the dominican people are not very friendly these people really need to work on their hospitality and it should be brought to the attention of the resort management companies bartenders in the lobby were out and out rude to most americans and caucasian people sad to say but true this would be the only reason i would not return to this resort or country for my next vacation all in all we had a great vacation we did not leave the resort or do any excursions we did tubing , banana boat , parasailing , snorkeling off the beach , rock climbing , trampoline , trapeze , lots of walks and participated in some of the pool activities the vendors are extemely obnoxious but u just walk by them and ignore their pushing and you 'll be fine your on vacation just enjoy yourself 
worst vacation - barcelo punta cana we were three friends travelling together we stayed in two rooms the first night we got to the hotel our air conditioner was not working in one of the rooms everything was wet when we woke up the next day so we requested to change rooms that was done at 2:00 in the afternoon even with the new room , the air conditioner was not very strong and it was always damp in the room in that same room , we ran out of warm water inbetween our very short showers , our hair dryer blew up and they always forgot to bring us new towels the food , well i read a lot of good reviews , but we did not enjoy anything except for the tokyo a la carte and the buffet was ok the beach party sucked it was a fire on the beach but nobody on the beach there is no animation , the shows were not very good at all well i dont have much to say that is good about this place except it has a gorgeous beach and they have a great photographer that takes really good pics worth the money to buy the pics 
the beach saves them from getting a lower rating let me start by saying that this is not our first trip and we have many other all - inclusives to compare to we stayed june 24th to july 1st with our three children ages 4,68 our overall first impression was not great our check in was long and frustrating as stated in some of the other reviews , not overly welcoming no one smiled and none of the staff seemed happy when you 're on vacation , this can be annoying i started to get concerned when lilttle annoyances cropped up and we tried to justify the lack of good service by making excuses like oh well , we did not pay that much for the trip and well this is their slow period the truth is , we are not really critical and we tried really hard to be objective but a few things just could not be overlooked here 's our very objective opinion : rooms : like so many other reviews , yes , it 's true , the rooms smell mouldy and the bedding is just as bad you have to appreciate how humid it is there and how challenging it would be to control this that being said , the rooms could have been much cleaner and this might have helped control some of the odor daily , the seemed to forget to give us clean towels , replace the coffee and fill the mini fridge our safe was also broken and after three calls down to the front desk with no results we decided just to give up because near the end they made as feel as though we were pestering them food : heres an interesting one they seemed to run out of food at the buffet on a regular basis we made a point of getting to the buffet shortly after it opened just to make sure that we could get a decent selection again , i have to wonder if this is because the hotel was only at about 50% capacity the quality of the food was hit or miss most days , we could find things we liked none of us starved the a la cartes were better do not expect gourmet here desserts were very good pool and beach : this is what won us over and made the trip enjoyable we 've been to a lot of beautiful beaches in the world but this one really is great lots of waves , water is beautiful and the beach is very soft , white and sandy the pool was well maintained no complaints here this is not their strength as i said earlier , when you 're on vacation , you do not want to be treated like you 're a bother we 're not stupid and we know that tipping can go a long way after several days of tipping and the same poor service , we wondered why we should bother something that really annoyed us was that there seemed to be a ton of staff staying on the resort and using the resort we caught on around the third day when we recognized some of the staff out of uniform sitting with what seem to be family or friends with them this would not normally bother us except that when you go up to get a drink at the bar and they ignore you for 5 minutes ( and it 's not busy ) because they 're busy chatting with staff that are not working that day and catering to their needs , you get sick of it i have a really hard time finding positive things to say about the service here barcelo really needs to take a good hard look at how they run this resort - tons of room for improvement here so you know , we heard a lot of other guests complaining about the same things i 'm would rate this resort a 3 out 5 we would consider going back if they improved their level of service we heard that the bahia down the way is by far superior to this resort you may want to consider going there instead 
beautiful wedding i stayed here june 2nd - june 9th - got married on june 5thhotel - check in and check out was good the grounds were very pretty everything seemed to be very clean room - musty smell but you are to expect that maids - great they did a good job staff - sucked they were very rude had a problem with the pull out couch , it collasped with my daughter in it had to end up with a fold out bed which was o but i have two children we had to get about three set of keys made in just one day due to the fact the door would not open was not impressed with the staff at all wedding coordinator - kerstin was great i emailed her at least once a week for about three months and then at the end a week or two before i left i emailed her everyday and she always contacted me back she even as called me could not ask for anyone better photographer - vanessa was great also she takes beautiful pictures could not afford them all but would have loved to have them all if you get married at this resort and need a photographer ask for her you will not be disappointed restaurants - most was good paris was horrible service we had to wait 3 hours ( never again ) tokio was the best also the italian was good also bars - swim up bar was the best i did not even tip til the end of our trip and she was great she really was good to my children i ca not say enough good things about her i would not even have to ask for what i wanted after one day she knew she would bring me drinks sometimes and get me to try them wanted to go on an excusion and asked up front at the activities desk about snorkeling and they recommended this excursion were everyone was drinking i called it the party boat something i did not want my children to see i even asked if it was kid friendly and they said yes we got to snorkel for 30 minutes ate a sandwich and swam for 55 minutes would i stay here again - no due to the fact that the staff was rude to my children would i come to punta cana again - yes 
great beach , nice pool and landscaping i am a well seasoned traveller and open to all kinds of adventures , cultures etc the barcelo was a mixed bag at best i upgraded to a suite  premium club level and was very unhappy with my first room the room smelled terrible dirty , stained upohlstery , moldy bathroom mirrors , mold in floor tiles etc truth is , i was really upset but rosa who runs the club premium lounge got me a much better room the next day that taken care of , there were a few more bugs to work out and over all this resort was okay i would not go back , but many have , so you decide the best thing about this resort is the beach the worst thing , the food the staff is very friendly and they do try to make your vacation a nice one if you get a good deal , it may be worth it get a good deal 
the good , the bad and the ugly i have been going down south every winter for 9 years and so far , there is no resort or destination that is perfect , without flaws that being said , staying at this resort was an enjoyable experience the good : the beach is amazing , vast and clean with white sand the ocean is beautiful , and swimming in it 's big waves was very fun , much clearer  better bottom than many other resorts i 've been to if you like calm water - do not go in here the waves  the undertow are strong , but great for active people who love jumping around in the waves , and the kids all seemed to love them the resort is well groomed  clean - it really is a nice resort to the eye there is alot to do here if you want in terms of activities , and it really is a fun resort the food is average , but not bad - like most resorts you 're absolutely sick of it after 3 days the mini - bar in your room is usually stocked with free beer  pop - a nice touch the day trips through transat were great - we went on atv 's for a day and had a blast , and went to the marinarium and had an equally great time the bad : the resort staff are friendly enough , but lazy they move at a snail 's pace and you can count on minimal effort when ordering drinks and such better to go to the bar and get it yourself sometimes our room was not cleaned yet at 3pm the resort had a market set up every day with little souvenirs , rum , cigars , etc and even more than other carribean destinations , we found the harrassment level was unbelievable but they do a 70/30 split with coke i got real drunk real fast without meaning to watch the sun obviously the ugly : saw too many huge cockroaches run into peoples rooms at night under their door after seeing this we decided to put towels under the door if you happen to get rain it does not drain too well we got hit with a severe downpour , and the first floor flooded - i mean suitcases floating down the hall poor 1rst floor guests the humidity - it is to be expected i know , but i ca not even relate how damp the rooms are we were constantly soaked while we in our room and our clothes were just wet basically everything in the room was always damp the floor would gather beads of water from the humidity it was not pleasant all in all a positive experience i 'm still looking for the perfect affordable resort i 'll let you know if i do 
ok i came back last saturday from the barcelo , punta cana i have to say that unfortunately , the weather was not the best but we still managed to have some fun the beach is spectacular and the water is beautiful do not forget to do some snorkling not expensive and worth it you get to go on a boat ride and see all the ocean view resorts going back , i would probably pay more in a 5 star hotel the staff were somewhat rude and the food i was sick for a few days but i think it 's because of the malaria pills beware of the side effects overall , i would give this resort a 3 
holiday from hell well for a start if your travelling to dominician republic , make sure u put locks on your cases becuase otherwise you will have everything stolen - like we did when u get to the hotel , you will have to stand like an idiot for half an hour to check in becuase the staff are so ignorant trips are rubbish - donnot go on the monster truck safari , its the most biggest rip off ever also dont touch the food becuase you will get salmonela poisioning like we have also even though it is all inclusive take lots of money becuase you wont get served unless u have a dollar in you hand even if u just want milk in you tea - which by the way you have to beg for sure you tip the maid , because your fridge wont be filled , so yeah you should dehydrate nicely with ur salmonela ear plugs because the noise at night time is ridiculous ever think you will have a nice drink because if they dont get you in the resturant they will poision you in the bar see you guys on watchdog 
read before you go me and my partner stayed at the barcelo punta cana in feb , from 12th to 26th and we have both agreed we will not be going back the first 3 days were ok , not great , but ok , the only good thing that we agreed on was the weather i had my 21st birthday 2 days after arriving , and the day after i became very ill i had the most awful stomach pains which doubled me over everytime i tried to walk i had this for 6 days , from thursday through to the following wednesday , needless to say i was room bound for half of my holiday when i did manage to venture out the following wednesday , i disovered that i was not the only one with this , as we got chatting to loadsa people and heard that 1 out of 2 of them had felt the same at some point in their holiday then the day after when i felt better , we had what we think was the end of a hurricane as the wind and rain was just phonomenal , absolute mental our next ray of sunshine was the day before we were due to come home the food in the buffet hall is swarming with flies all the time , so bad infact , that me and my partner would not have breakfast , we would buy things for lunch , and on the nights where we were not alloated an a la carte resturant we were buying things from the shop for our dinner onto the a la carte resturants the el sombero mexican was lovely apart from being situated on sand , and having a power ut while we were eating our starter , resulting in me being bitten alive by sandflies in the dark the food was great the conuco dominican resturant , the food , was great , the waiter was very nice and polite the tokyo japanese resturant was fantastic and entertaining at the same time , we went there twice , it was that good however , the other resturants ( paris , etc ) were awful when we went to the paris resturant , we waited for about 45mins for our starter , another 45 mins for our mian meal , and we then left as we were not gonna wait another 45mins for dessert the staff at barcelo punta cana some of them were very nice , very smiley , very polite they were not interested the bar staff however were even worse when we booked this holiday we were told by our travel agent that tipping was not permitted in this hotel however now it is , and the bar staff were only interested in serving you if you had a tip in your hand at one point i was at the beach bar , and i waited roughly a total of 30mins to be served , and all the people that were coming up with tips were getting served before me , inluding 2 seven - nine yr olds the rooms in this complex were ok they were not as nice as described or shown in the brochure the day after we arrived , we had a note left on our door to say our room was going to be fumigated surely they should 've changed our rooms or something , but they didnt , and it turned out when we went back , it hadnt even been done time we did have in the sun , we were surrounded by flies , and wasps , when we were by the pool and when we went on the beach we were also surrounded with sandflies which made it very hard to relax you have any questions , dont hesitat to contact and ask 
so , so for the money this was our first trip to the dominican and friends from halifax asked us to meet them , so off we went the check in was terrible we arrived at noon and were told our room was not ready and to come back at 3pm we opened our luggage and got changed and went to the beach ok , no problem we came back at 3:30 and the room was not ready checking the room number we went upstairs to check ourselves were no maids in site other than some guys working on the door in the next unit downstairs to find that our room was now ready , hurray they gave us the keys for the room and back up we went only to find out that the locks were changed and now had a new swipe card lock downstairs to get a key again the room was ok and appeared clean this room was located at the back side of the hotel and the balcony was considered a garden view it actually overlooked the employees entrance and the road with a little bit of forest and some garbage the sliding doors to the balcony need overhauled as they are very hard to open and close our friends from halifax recommended that we upgrade our room as they had a similar type of room and upgraded to a pool view suite at an extra $60 00 us a night my wife and i went down to the check in to try and upgrade , but were told that nothing could be done until the next day well , nova scotian 's to the rescue and with a little bit of east coast charm and a $$$$$ tip we were upgraded to an ocean view that night at $30 00 us a night there was only one surprise one morning as 2inch long cockroach scurried under the door , but hairspray to the rescue and it was all over for him had been warned previously that these critters dont like light , so we left a hall light on all night just in case i 'm not saying our first room was bad , but there was no view now to enjoy ourselves there is a wide variety of foods available and were quite good , especially in the buffet the restaurants are all good , except for the french restaurant as far as the food is concerned the waiters have a tendency of forgetting parts of your meal and this was common at all the retaurants , eg - soup or salad or desserts , etc the beach is excellent and the sand is not coarse can walk for miles there are virtually no peddlars on the beach pestering you to buy trinkets , other than those trying to sell excursions they do not bother you at all the water is nice , but rough , watch the undertow and dont let little ones go in alone , it can be scary overall the resort is nice , but old the service is poor at about 50% and unless you tip , it can be non - existant my experience in life has been that if you do a good job , then you should get recognized for it , via a tip , but here a tip gives a good job , so it 's a little like putting the cart before the horse apparently , barcelo has a 2 year plan to upgrade this hotel and spend a couple of million $$$ , so maybe i 'll wait until then to return and maybe they 'll have trained their staff a little better by then 
beautiful place we stayed here for 1 week ( march 22- march30,2007) we took our 2 children age 5  9 dont let the weather on the internet fool you it said thundershowers all week but we had 1 day of a storm and a few showers another day the rest of the week the weather was extremely hot some suggestions for people **take a traveling mug for your drinks they only give you small cups and the drinks melt asap **very important** there wasnt alot of children activites through out the day if you are taking younger children take their life jackets for the ocean and a airmatress for the pool it is costly to buy one there , you will use even if you do not have children with you we loved the tokyo rest the night shows arnt the best but they are a little entertaining there is a little flemarket about a 15 min walk do not waste your money going by taxi to the other bigger one all the stuff is the same and they really hassle you there ( remember stuff in the dominican is double the price to buy then in mexico and the same stuff ) we heard the tour swimming with the sharks and stingrays was the best tour around ( i think it was about 68 us pp ) bring lots of sunscreen as you burn fast here the beach is beautiful , make sure you walk the whole beach to see everything we bought things to give away to the children there but only seen 1 child in the market , so no need to do this unless you have plans on going right into a town overall , nice hotel , clean *** if you want the quiet section of the hotel ask for section 6 or 7 we stayed in room 7101 and it was a great location , close to pool and beach ( also very quiet ) section 2 you are right around the party area and it is loud we flew air transat good idea to spend the 15 pp and researve your seats when you book we paid around 1000pp and feel it was worth it i would not pay 1500 pp for this so watch and try to get the best deal we booked through itravel2000 or watch on escapes great place and great holiday the pencersdelta b march 30, 2007 
great vacation barcelo punta cana reviewfamilygal from canada march 7-21, 2007once you land you feel the intense heat , walking from the plane to the airport building you are sweating going though was a breeze the bus ride was about ? hour in a air - conditioned bus when you arrive at the hotel they have two kinds of waiting for you in a self serve machine it was nice and refreshing check in ? no problems here we got two rooms side by side as requested and the rooms were ready when we arrived you receive two room keys , a safe key and a form for beach towels rooms - nice size nothing too fancy we were in building 5 second floor we had a new shower curtain , new soap dispenser which held shower gel , shampoo , and conditioner in the bathroom 2 bars of soap , shower cap and comb are in a small basket 2 double beds with new blankets on them , desk and chair , two end tables , and about 7 drawersfor clothing we had enough hangers in the closet for two people amini fridge , which held , 4 bottles of water , 2 pepsi and 2 7- up this was refilled everyday our maid had the room cleaned most days by 11:00 am only once it was cleaned around 4:00 pm and this was by a different maid our maid was off that day we tipped daily $ 2 00 and a token gift like nail polish , toothpaste , knee highs be careful if you are buying gifts only for females we saw at least 3 male maids restaurants - we ate at tokyo , el conuco , paris , roma and el sombrero they all seemed to be fine make sure you take your camera to tokyo the chef puts on a really good show buffets - lots of food to choose from always two soups , salad , pasta , french fries then a variety of other foods you will not go hungry we always had lunch at el marlinit was close to beach and pool bars and drinks - there are 5 bars and one in the disco i tried many drinks my favorite was sex on the beach and bombe in the evenings the lobby bars tended to get a little busy both my hubby and i enjoyed a cappuccino after dinner in the lobby pool - very large with lots of loungers , we never had a hard time finding loungers umbrellas it was the luck of the draw yes people save umbrellas but the part that bothered us was the people saving both umbrellas at the pool and huts at the beach beach - amazing waves were big , sometimes the undertow strong we had one red flag day in two weeks lots of water sports to take part in kayaks , boogie boards , catamarans , windsurfing , banana boat medical - we never got sick however my husband did have an allergic reaction to something i convinced him to see the house doctor when his lips were at least 4 times the size of normal lips be sure to call your insurance company before you go to the doctor doctor hector spoke english and we were taken care of promptly phone calls to canadain the room there is a note saying to call canada dial 11 then the area code and number an english speaking operator comes on and asks you want you want to do i said make a collect phone call to number? she promptly replies that that number will not accept collect calls ( strange i have never heard of that before ) she then says to complete the call she needs a credit card number i only had to call my parents to tell them we arrived safely so i figured it wouldn?? cost much so silly me gave the number when we got home i downloadedmy mc transactions and that 1 minute 22 second call cost me a whopping $49 thank goodness the other 4 calls i made i billed to my hotel room 4 calls totaling 22 minutes grand total bill at check out time was only $18 00check outno problems at all , remember to bring back your beach towel form to the front desk they only delay was waiting for 3 college boys to board the bus they must have partied to much the night before whenthe front desk called to tell them the bus was leaving , they were still sleeping needless to say when they got on the bus 10 minutes later they did not look so good other itemsbe sure to haggle with the vendors that come to the hotel their prices start off very high , and then they ask you ??hat do you want to pay? go low and then you can both meet in the middle take lots of sunscreen - it was very hot we took malaria medication to be on the safe side however we did not get any bites on the plane one lady had lots of mozzie bites ( maybe they had lots of stagnant water - not sure ) we did two excursions manati park and horse back riding along the beach my girls enjoyed both tremendously my husband and i thought the manati park was a rip off we would not recommend this tour to our friends and family lots of things are being done around the resort every day i saw people painting , removing mattress and replacing them , tiles being replaced i strongly believe they are doing their best to upgrade the hotel please please be careful around the pool , the tiles are very slippery when they are wet remember that a smile goes a long way we always said ??ola? to any worker that passed us by it didn?? matter if they were a gardener or waitress or person that cleans the bathrooms if you have any questions please feel free to e - mail me be sure to put barcelo punta cana in the subject box ( aka familygal 
disappointed i must say we were disappointed - we are not fussy people and we did make due with what we had upon arrival at check in we were offered our room before it was cleaned as we were early i was definitely not interested in a dirty room we had to refuse him twice then we went for a drink while our room was getting ready i ordered a beer and the glass was dirty our room was very ordinary but clean unfortunately my husband found a cockroach the third day but only told me about it a day before we left wish he would only have told me when we arrived after a week here the food get very very boring i 'm sure it all depends on what you compare it to we are used to 4 1\2 stars and this i would not give a 3 - maybe a 2 i will never again go to this place nor would i recommend it to anyone we met people there that had been to this resort many times as it was a favourite but after this year they said never again apparently block 5 and 7 are the renovated ones if your lucky you will get one we were in block 2 where the nightly entertainment was we had read that it was a noisy place but the show is done at 10:30 so it was nothing to complain about we could see the show from our balcony but unfortunately the shows were extremely boring so we never finished one we are people that love to go watch the shows and usually do not miss one one lady 's room was so humid that water would drip from her ceiling on her when she was in the bathroom getting ready the air conditioning is very strong even on low and it hits directly on you when you are in bed my husband is a good sleeper and he sleeps well anywheres but here he did not have one good nights sleep we paid the same price for this resort as we did last year and it was definitely not of the same quality i will be very careful in the future about what i pick and choose hope this helps and as i said i am not a picky person thank god the weather and the beach was beautiful 
bad experience  we went down as a group of about 45 for a wedding , the hotel looked nice , rooms where kept ok , a/c in rooms worked great at times alittle too cool if you are planning to get married there dont , there seems to be alot of little catches , we thought we had all the legal fees and money owing all paid in full , to start with could not locate the wedding coordinator or get her to return calls for a day and ahalf , when we did find her she informed us the government had just implemented a new law and it would cost us an extra $600 for the wedding ( very upsetting for all concerned ) we said we would not pay they did alittle talking in spanish of course and got the price down to $300 which we paid just to keep the peace and worry about when we got home , there is not much you can do in a foreign country , we talked to other couples that got married that same week and they all seemed to get an extra charge but all got different explanations and amounts wedding did finally come off very nice though well over half of us were sick while we where their , not sure whether it was the food or water or combination plus the added smell of sewer during the day the beaches were about the nicest i have ever seen , white sand and lots of place to walk tipping at this hotel has gotten way out of hand too , if you did not tip everyone you could forget about service because they would cater to the people who were flashing money away ahead of you most people just did not want to help you out too much if you had any questions or concerns it sure would not be a choice for me to ever go to this hotel again , you need to stay with smaller places i think to get the service 
nightmare i thought this place needed an overhaul dirty , half of our 60 people group got sick , rooms were not acceptable and falling apart staff was ok shows were a joke drinks were horrible i have stayed in better motel 6's 
do not bother my wife and i stayed at this resort last year we have gone down south every year since we were married 12 years ago and this was our worst experience yet the food at the buffet was horrendous and usually the food at the a la carte restaurants is better at most resorts , but here it was even worse our 2 dogs at home would have probably turned their noses up at this food our room was in terrible need of repairs ( i chipped walls , patio door had to be lifted to close etc staff were unfriendly and uncaring and to top it all off , it rained 5 out 7 days , with 2 days complete washouts this resort is supposedly a 4 to 4 5 stars but more like 2 to 2 as our plane lifted off the runway in punta cana , i told my wife , have a good look dear , because we 'll never see this place again 
resort riddled with sickness we do not recommend anyone to go to this resort , especially families with young children the beauty of the exterior of the resort , pool and beach unfortunately could not make up for the horrible sickness that ran through the resort and left our young child with vomiting and diarreah for 5 days we travelled with a large group of friends and 75% or better fell ill with the same sickness including my husband and i check in was a nightmare and it was clear that in order to get a room , towels , clean sheets or other basic amenities you were required to pay off ( tip ) the staff we will never return and would not recommend this resort to anyone 
first of all , visiting a sunny beach in the middle of winter - regardless of the condition of the resort or our personal experiences - was amazingly beautiful and relaxing however , i have to be honest about our experience because i feel that we owe it to other travelers who are considering staying here my husband and i visited the resort from december 20 - 27th and it fell so short of our expectations that it took us a few days to shake off the shock of it all checking in was a painfully slow and confusing process - which pretty much describes every single interaction with the staff during our stay no one knew where to stand or whether there was even anyone there to check us in we all just sort of huddled around the front desk hoping that someone would take notice of us at first we were given a tiny room with 2 full beds even though we had specifically requested a room with a king size bed we immediately upgraded to a room with a pool view for $70 the view from the new room was gorgeous and was definitely worth the money the room itself was older than we expected and was in need of renovation - but we did not spend much time in our room so we did not stress too much one thing i will say about the room was that the sheets were very old and were so badly pilled and itchy that we slept in long pants and long sleeve shirts overall , the feeling we got from the resort is that the staff and management are just doing the bare minimum to keep the resort functioning there are several sections of the resort in disrepair - including whole sections of walls torn out , entire hallways with burned out lights , broken chairs , stained sofa cushions , boarded up elevators , trash in stairwells , scuffed walls and broken railings we certainly never expected 5 star service or accomodations , but the staff at this resort clearly have no interest in meeting the expectations of their guests and there does not seem to be any sense of urgency about getting the resort renovated by the end of the week we both agreed that we rarely felt welcomed by anyone who worked there ( with the exception of a few random staff members who really made an effort to make the guests comfortable ) i think by far , the very worst part of our experience was the food you should avoid the alcazar buffet at all costs although , you almost need to eat there at least once so that you can appreciate the mediocre food in the sit - down restuarants i am not a picky eater but after 5 minutes of browsing the buffet on the first night i realized that we were in for a long week i 'm all for trying different food - but we never saw anything on the buffet that was fresh the salads and fruits were always warm , bruised and wilted the hot foods were always lukewarm and were a crusty , clotted lump within minutes after a few days i developed terrible stomach pains from even the simple foods i was eating and ended up losing weight while i was there because i felt so sick every time i ate anything it took about a week for my stomach to get back to normal after we got home also , do not rely on the cashier to ever have cash we went every single day trying to get smaller bills for tipping and such but not once did they have cash ( we also saw other people go through the same thing as we would pass through the lobby ) the atm was broken for the 6 of the 7 days we were there and we were sent to the resort next door to use their machine - which was also broken if you would like to have cash on hand for buying gifts or tipping - then exchange your money at home we do not hate the resort or even the people who work there we loved laying in the sun , lounging by by the beautiful pool and playing in the ocean we just felt disappointed many times throughout the week there are things to like about the resort ( which i 'm sure you can read about ) but you really should know that this place does not measure up to most all - inclusive resorts as much as we had been looking forward to a beach vacation - we could not wait to get home 
a fun time we just returned from a great holiday , with our three children and 2 grandkids ages 16  14 i would recommend this resort to anyone the grandkids had plenty to do and met some great young people the kids had plenty to do , they were never bored ignore all the complaints about the rooms the rooms were clean , and the air - conditioning worked well , the maid was great - she often made little animals out of towels or stuff left on the bed - even sprinkled flowers out a couple of times the buffet was good but it can become repetitive ??he a la carte restaurants were good especially the japanese and italian the only problem was trying to find these restaurants , as there are no signs anywhere the beach was amazing , the kids spent hours playing volleyball the pool was clean with lots of things going on? it was fun just watching the activities? do see some interesting things the service at the swim up bar was slow but worth the wait? they don?? pinch on the booze the staff was friendly , we didn?? see a rude person in the 2 weeks the guys and gal at the beach bar were awesome the only complaint i have is the driving ? i can?? believe it the bus trip from the airport to the resort was unbelievable most of the time we were on the wrong side of the road we took a trip to santo domingo , i was wondering if we would ever see the resort again??t one point we drove on the sidewalk to get around the traffic , and when we hit a detour on the road the tour guide and a few men from the bus just got out moved the barrier and we kept going only in the dominican overall it was a great holiday and i would return 
read the reviews with care they might just help you out well after booking the holiday and ( hotel allocated on arrival ) we sussed out the three hotels it could be all were given a 4t or even a 4t+ ( thomsons platinum ) and to our dismay all three had bad reports but my partner and myself are seasoned travellers so we make allowances here and there taking into account that some people want the earth for next to 'nowt so after a bit of a rough ride from the airport in a slightly boneshaker of a bus we reached the hotel you really need a map to guide you round the place till you can get your bearings , our room smelt of damp and was like this for the first week till it was aired , small insects came out from various places to get at any scaps of sugar spilt from making cofee , this all pails into insignificance when i talk about the food which was well presented and a good variety but was never served hot only slightly warm , this was the case in all the restaurants we tried and even after taking care both myself and partner went down with possible food poisioning my partner on the second day myself on the third , we were unable to shake this off and had it for the duration of our holiday ( two weeks ) staff were always pleasant and some went out of their way to make the stay enjoyable , so here 's the warning take plenty of imodiom or suchlike and make sure you pay the excess on your travel insurance ( if you need to be hospitalized ) as one woman was while we were there was not an isolated case as many of the guests in the hotel were complaining about stomach upsets 
never again my family and i ( a total of 22 people ) visited breezes punta cana from oct 5 - oct the pool area was beautiful ( except for the occasional poop found in the pool , yes , i know disgusting , but true ) , the beach is definitely the nicest i 've ever been too ( very , very clean ) and the drinks were also good the bad ( or rather the okay ) the rooms are average and are in need of a total makeover or should i say facelift , and the staff tried to please but rarely understood what we were asking them , the ugly food , food and more food i 've never been to a place where the food was absolutely terrible also , trying to make reservations at any of the restaurants if you are a large group most of the restaurants are very warm ( the air conditioning does not work to well in any of them ) and men having to wear pants to the outside restaurants ( in that heat ) is completely ridiculous we were there for 6 days , i do not know how people did it for 2 weeks 
very disappointed we traveled to the domincan aug 11-18th for a first vacation together far away from work for we thought would be a five star property the pictures and descriptions could not have been further from the truth while the beach was the best thing going for them the staff we were exposed to were rude , disrespectful and far from what the property was described as being the drinks were watered down as i have heard this was possible and when you asked for top shelf they were out or they did not act like they knew what we were talking about we understood that it is a third world country and that there is a language barrier , but the staff know more english than they let on we were told by an employee at the resort of the airconditioning problems they have had for apprx 7 months , since it was cooler outside than the restr which was at least 100 degrees , everyone was sweating and fanning themselves the food was not acceptable we found the fruit and french fries the best that is not good for what you pay we spent over $3,000 which included our flight and we might as well have put a match to it we could actually back - charge the resort through our credit card company since they put a value on the items describe as part of the hotel amenities the front desk would not give us a lock for the safe to keep our passports in for 3 days , calling them and going to the front desk did not do any good finally we were able to obtain the lock from someone who was a bit nicer the bank would not open with a line standing ( customers ) out the door after 9am , until one of the vendors on the property came to the door we are middle class , hard working people who just wanted a nice vacation and to be waited on a little , we would never travel back to this area and strongly advise travel agents to stay at the resorts in the area before booking them for customers a guest ( and family ) we met who spoke spanish and french spent some time with us and had an equally disappointing stay , he spoke to the manager and encouraged us to do the same this of course did nothing , she had been vented on many times for the same issues 
if you want to loose weight choose this hotel my husband and i went on a two week holiday aug /sept to breezes with our four year old daughter the holiday was a reasonable price for a late deal but that still did not excuse this hotels health issues they seem to have been poisoning tourists for a couple of years now , going by the reviews , and thomson , who i always took to be a sincere company until now , are still sending people there nearly everyone we spoke to had gastric problems including a honeymoon couple my husband lost pounds in weight luckily children werent affected so much but it made you paranoid about eating anything people from other hotels were fine there was also an outbreak of about 200 ear infections so we didnt use the pool after that this resort needs an input of cash so it can be cleaned and spruced up , new towels , linen , pillows , sunbeds screw in the electrics and make the hotel safe pay those staff more and teach them good kitchen hygine so they are happier or the hotel will loose star rating altogether we actually did have a good holiday the weather was gorgeous throughout , the beach was the most beautiful weve ever seen and the waves were fun there were humming birds and parrots outside our window and the breeze kept the mosquitos at bay the other tourists were fun and helpful and my daughter loved the mini disco and the friends she made there the entertainment was cheesey but well done and the dominicans for once showed genuine smiles while performing 
not a 4 star i just came back from the breezes last sunday i have to say that i have been to many all inclusives resorts in the past few years and this is one of the worst hotel i have stayed the food was not good , and i have been to cuba , mexico etc and never a complaint , but this time i even got sick not to mention the beach grill , the meat for the burgers would be grilled almost 1 hour in advance the staff was not that friendly , at time even rude one night me and my son got to the mexican restaurant at 19h25, the reservation was for 19h30, there is only a few people sitting down at the tables , and we were told to come back once it 's 19h30 in a rude and abrupt way one day i went to get information on the snorkeling trips at the diving center , the employee was more interested in checking me out than helping me needless to say that we did not buy any trip from him i left a $3 tip for the maid every day , not once she gave us any extra , some days she would not even put any bottles of water back in the mini bar and the room was not that clean , hair on the floor and in the bath tub i only ask for a minimum a little trick , if you go to this hotel , bring a bottle of febreze it helps a little and remove a little bit of the musty smell the beach is beautiful and the entertainment staff was ok all in all , i would not recommand this hotel only because i have been to other 4 stars hotels , and they were much much nicer it looks good on the pictures montreal , canada 
beautiful place , good time , but my family and i stayed here in july and i have to say we had a good time the resort is very nice , the employee 's very nice , the beach beautiful but we had a lot of problems with our room and had to be moved 2 times i would say at least 40% of the guests here had room problems also the other downfall is the food is terrible we have been to a lot of all inclusive resorts , but never have we been so disappointed with the food if i where you i would do a little more research and you will find a better place 
fair i had not been away to the caribbean for about 10 years , so bringing my two children 13 and 10 i was very excited i was also meeting my sister who was arriving later in the day we got there early so we knew our room would not be ready we checked our bags , but i was smart enough to pack a separate bag with our bathing suits in it we changed in the common bathroom and were ready to go of course i had to stop and get us a drink from the lobby bar , which took quite some time we explored the resort and found it to be lovely went to the beach and the kids went wading in the ocean while i went to get us more drinks , this time at the beach bar this took a long time again i am an attractive , very fit woman and i am not accustom to being pretty much ignored it took me approximately 10 minutes to get a glass ( cup ) of wine and soda for my kids around 3:00 our room was ready and the transfer of our luggage went fine our room was nice enough , beautiful view of resort and ocean we had what we needed my only complaint about the room was it was freezing , so we turned down the a/c , but that made condensation on the floor we complained , but they said there was nothing they could do , so we kept towels on the floor to wipe the moisture up constantly because i was not going to be cold my sister was checked in and much to my surprise , she was two rooms away this resort is huge so i was very happy about that for dinner , we tried to get into the japanese restaurant , but we were told we needed reservations and they were booked , but the place looked empty my sister who speaks fluent spanish tried speaking with them , but no way we were told we had to come back at 4:30 to wait on line to make a reservation i wait on line while i 'm not on vacation , the last thing i wanted to do was wait on line to make a stupid reservation we tried the other restaurants , but they were booked as well , + the french restaurant had a wedding and was not taking reservations at all we ate at the buffet so the next day , i got there at 4:30 like they said and the line was enormous the person in front of me was the last reservation i was able to get us into the italian restaurant this night , ( the kids loved the tortellini alfredo ) but it was my daughter that really wanted the japanese so the next day i went back at 3:30 to find i was the third person on line i was smart i brought 2 drinks with me since i knew i 'd be there a while needless to say , being third on line , i finally got the reservation after all this , the food was not that good at all the only place we did not have to make a reservation was the mexican place we just gave our name and were told to come back in about a 1/2 hour this was the only bar that actually served you right away and did not make you feel invisible the pool bar was a joke you could probably be drowning and no one would notice you at one point myself and my sister waited a 1/2 hour and no one even looked our way if you were not doing a beer bong you did not belong there my kids were looking forward to going to a swim up bar just to hang in the pool and drink a soda , what a disappointment we did a few excursions - a two hour horse ride , which was excellent the horses are a bit tired , but we went full gallop down the beach on our way back the kids loved this , but a word of advice , barter with the guys we went from $60 a person to $50 we did an all day safari where they give you a jeep to drive yourself it 's an all day thing , but well worth the money then we did a snorkeling excursion the boat ride from hell since we left during a storm the water was very rough , rain pelting your like gun shot and your butt slamming up and down on the metal seats , was just excruciating , i think it 's because i am thin and do not have much padding if you bring bread with you , the fish will eat it right out your hands , but watch your fingers the ride back was much smoother my son had a cold when we left , but it turned worse as the days went by we went to the doctor at the resort and he sent us to a clinic in an ambulance we got to the clinic where they did not speak english they took and x - ray of my son with me standing right next to him then in broken english , the doctor said he had fluid in his lungs and had to stay there for two days while i go back to the resort are you freak 'en kidding me they told me i had to come back the next day and see the pediatrician needless to say i refused and they sent me back with zyrtec and an expectorant zytec is for allergies , my son was already on allergy medication i do not know if they thought i was stupid or something , but i had been a mother for 13 years , i knew my son just had bronchitis and need an anti - biotic we took a cab back to the resort for $20 00 ( thank god i had $ on me ) and i found my sister and we went back to the resort doctor i told him that he had bronchitis and need an antbiotic , he handed it to me right there within 3 days , my son was fine my advice to anyone traveling out of the country , go to your doctor and get an antibiotic and bring it with you to top it off , when i got the bill for all this , it was $1200 00 and they had two days f service on it i fought the charges and they changed it to $800 bottom line of this resort , people not helpful or friendly and give bad service if it was not for the extra things we did , it would have been a complete waste of my hard earned money bring your pocket book because i spend and additional $1500 not including my son 's medical bills 
majority of the staff unfriendly it was my first time to a trip abroad especially to an all - inclusive resort i went with high expectations i figure since i speak the language that it would not be a problem majority of the staff were not friendly bathroom mat disgusting wires sticking out of the outlets to the elevator they were fixing an elevator and they did not have a danger sign unsafe for small children make sure you put everything in the safe the food was ahhh dominican restaurant lousy do not go with a big appetite they say the serve premium liquor only saw absolut and stoli but not at all bars buy your own when leaving to the trip at the duty free bring your own cranberry or oj were only able to do it one time they stamp you to make sure bring your own singles you 're lucky if the bank on site has $$$ i must say though , the beach is exceptional all in all my friends and i made the best of it but next time if we go to dr we will try paradisius ( sp 
waste of money if you do , go with low expectations this was the biggest waste of our hard - earned money ever we have gone to other all - inclusive resorts and were pleased the pictures on the web site are accurate , until you see it up close , in person first , the good things : the beach was gorgeous lots of families very enjoyable , our favorite part of the trip huts are taken early , but there are plenty of chairs the snorkeling excursion , the caribbean festival , was great very nice and entertaining crew double - decker pontoon boat fun day , good snorkeling , good snacks really enjoyed this now , the bad things : in general , the entire resort was in disrepair everythings needs repair , paint , and updating our room was okay , beds were hard mattresses on wood , bathroom tile was cracked and moldy , toilet leaked on floor maids did do a good job each day we were near the pool , it was very noisy until midnight or later with parties the pool tiles were all cracked , the water was warm , the pool bar crowded with beer parties going on ( not a family environment ) we stayed away from the pool and at the beach every day the food was less than adequate we had to survey the entire buffet to find something that we were not cautious about eating the open - air buffet had flies on the food the waiters were less than helpful the freshly - grilled items seemed to be the best bet the drinks were usually warm , the filtered water had an odor the specialty restaurants were a little better , but still not what we were expecting the kids club was also in disrepair we did not leave our 9 yr old there did not feel safe in doing so we will not be going back to this resort , probably not to the dr 
ok , but had some issues with the food ok stay we have stayed at over 20 carribbean/mexico all - inclusives and this one ranks towards the bottom of the list if you have not been , the dr is very third world and expectations should be set appropriately overall : my wife and i stayed for a week and it was probably too long not much to do outside the resort also as far as the resort it was ok there are lots of kids , but due to the large size of the resort , there is still enough place to go ( especially the beach area palapa 's ) to not be surrounded and have some quiet reading places there is a lot of acitivity around the resort with all of the usual all - inclusive like items there are also no shortage of the timeshare sales people aviod them unless you really want to lose hours of your vacation food : as far as the food went , it was a real disappointment the food was edible in most cases , but not much better than that it is really hard to mess up breakfast , but they figured out how here the only edible part of breakfast was the cold cereal the lunches were equally as bad , but the grilled chicken by the pool saved the day here as far as dinner went , the best food was at the french restaurant ( not really french food , but tasted ok ) the italian restaurant was ok , but the others were poor we both were very sick after eating at the japanese restaurant ( the food tasted good , but we paid for it that evening and the next day bars : the hotel advertises top shelf liquor there is some , but when it runs outs , there was never any to replace it also , they strategically place the liquor around at different bars to insure that you can not order a routine mixed drink with brand names ( ie the cuervo tequila is never at the same bar as the cointrou ) besically all drinks are made with very cheap local dominican liquor the beer is presidente draft ( local and typical of the rest of the carribbean beer ) and is ok the highlight of the bar is the beer and dark rum ( both local and pretty good ) tipping : ignore the no tipping policy tipping is essential for good service like most all - inclusives , a dollar here and a dollar there goes a long way to get good service i strongly recommend that you arrive with $10 per day in $1 bills also , a $5 tip will get you immediatly into any of the gourmet dinner reservation only restaurants without any reservation the staff ( bartenders , waitstaff , maids , mini bar server , etc ) will remember you and take care of you for routine tipping rooms : the rooms were ok we had a king bed with a partial beach view the room is a bit small , but the shower was good and the bath was nice the room was very clean and a couple of $1s each day on the bed and the same on the mini bar kept our room very nice every day resort : huge place with a good pool and very nice beach lots of people around all the time as well all in all breezes would be ok for a long weekend i felt like a week was too long here i would say that breezes punta cana is just like any other large all inclusive carribbean resort not great , but not bad either 
do not believe all you read , experience it yourself after booking this trip and then reading the negative reviews we approached our departure with a little trepidation the end result of our trip was we had a great time i 'll quickly give a rundown of our experience rooms - small but nice with strong ac had a small leak in the bathroom which took maintenance three days to address other room oriented requests ( more towels , water , extra pillows , etc ) answered quickly pleasant and cooperative housekeeping staff food - not for the picky eater a lot of dominican dishes please bear in mind that this resort caters to americans , british , germans , hispanics and canadians predominantly and tries to offer a wide spectrum of foods there is plenty to eat of good quality we ate in the italian , japanese , french , and mexican restaurants , all very good with good service our first night there we ate at the alcazar which is the buffet restaurant it was dominican night and the food was great we also ate at european night with the same satisfaction breakfast and lunches are served at the alcazar and marlin grill there is also a 24 hour bar and grill at the el sombrero for the partiers upon arrival you are already pre - booked for 3 specialty restaurants if you choose to change these reservations or add to your bookings you must show up at the front desk at 9am to do so i have read many reviews stating that you have to be at the desk at 6am to get a spot on line we did not experience this at all pool - although we spent most of our time at the beach , the pool is beautiful it is well maintained and clean swim up bar could be expanded to accommodate more guests beach - beautiful bars - no watered down drinks , no complaints presidente is the only beer available we spent most of our time at the beach taking a relaxing vacation the only activity we participated in was the banana ride which is an inflatable tube pulled by a boat ( i just wanted to clarify that a lot of fun and free there is plenty to do but we decided to just lay low overall , not a 4 or 5 star , but a high 3 you have to keep in mind that you are going to a third world country where things are not as opulent as you might want if you have high standtards and expectations do not go if you are looking for a fun place with decent food , rooms and a beautiful beach then give it a try it 's not a dump with apathetic , unfriendly employees and bad food as many reviews suggest keep an open mind our 8 year old wants to go back that 's a good sign 
really relaxing very nice hotel and grounds i found it to be very clean and never saw a bug anywhere the beach was so beautiful and relaxing we spent most of our time at the beach and in the ocean the ocean was warmer and quieter than the pool the pool area is loud and has many activities i went there to relax so i found it very annoying , but my husband enjoyed it since he does not like to sit around i found the food to be not so great there were many choices , but i believe that they catered more to european taste by the end of our week stay i was really ready for healthy food at home definitely not for the low calorie diet i came home with a flu bug and my husband with a rash we both went to the doctor when we got home and were told it was from the food our biggest gripe was that every time we called for bottle water , towels , a pillow , etc one day we called for extra towels and waited 2 hours then went to dinner and asked the front desk again and then went back after dinner and called again because they never came and still never got them if you want anything to your room get it yourself from a maid standalso we had a broken lock on our slider to our patio and asked several times at the front desk and they never came i enjoyed my relaxing time on the beach , but would not go back 
wedding day disaster our daughter was married at the iberostar bavaro in punta cana on december 6, 2008 she hired a wedding planner in the united states to help communicate better with the wedding planner at the iberostar we went through a travel agent in order to make certain all the plans for our guests would be flawless we started all the planning in march , 2008, a full 9 months before the wedding to assure that everything went perfect all the planning was to no avail what our guests witnessed and what the newly married couple and her parents had to go through leaves me spellbound the wedding ceremony was set on a spectacular stretch of beach the chairs were set up for our 70 guests however , the yellow caution tape surrounding the wedding ceremony is quite visible in all pictures , ruining the ambience the couple arranged for a dominican justice of thepeace to marry them ( we have many e - mails confirming this ) as i stood beside my husband , i kept asking , where is the justice of the peace : who is going to marry them much to our surprise , the wedding planner dressed in her iberostar uniform stepped up to perform the ceremony after the ceremony , the confusion began we had arranged for the guests to have champagne timmediately following the ceremony but no one communicated this to our guests they eventually figured out that the champagne was for them and started to drift toward the table the wedding party was taking pictures with the photographer as our wedding guests tried to guess where to go next we had arranged for cocktails and hors 'dourves outside the reception at the steakhouse however , nothing was set up when our guests arrived the guests started to arrange the tables with votive candles , light the candles and then tried to track down the bartender we paid extra for all of this to be prepared when our guests arrived the bride and groom were left alone on the beach after the photographer finished they walked by themselves back to the cocktail hour the tables were not ready at the steak house and we waited for over an hour before entering the steakhouse finally , the guests just stormed in the bride and groom were once again left on their own to figure out what to do with everyone seated , the bride and groom waited to be announced however , there was no one to announce them as husband and wife with the bride in tears , i stepped onto the dance floor , grabbed the michrophone and announced the newly married couple where was the wedding planner she was at another wedding taking place at the same time we had 75 people attending our wedding she was at the wedding with 20 people the salad bar was set up but there was no one there to direct our guests as to when to start getting their salad i grabbed the microphone and told our guests to start making their way to the salad bar finally things settled down and the waiters started to take drink and dinner orders things were starting to run smoothly but not for long just as the cake was served , i noticed one of the waiters dressed in his iberostar uniform guzzling a beer i went to him and asked him to please return to serving our guests he danced provocatively toward me and began to grind me i ordered him to stop and he quickly apologized i walked to my seat with him following me and apologizing profusely he put his tray down on the floor beside me and spilled a full glass of beer all over my shoes , feet and the floor under my table a wedding guest sitting beside me mopped the mess off the floor under me once again , i asked the waiter to please , wait on our guests and get me a glass of wine a few minutes later , i saw the same waiter at a guests ' table with a bottle of wine and some glasses i walked toward him and asked him to please pour me a glass of wine what happened next is so humiliating he drank from the bottle of wine and then poured some into a glass and handed it to me he walked behind me , grabbed me in the groin and started to grind me from behind my brother saw what was happening and raced over to get the waiter away from me i quickly spoke to one of the managers he was dressed in a plaid shirt with a western style tie the manager laughed at me but shortly after , i noticed that the waiter had been sent out of the wedding immediately after this episode , the disc jockey shut down all his equipment and the wedding abruptly ended what a nightmare for the newly married couple they thought they were being married in paradise it ended up to be a wedding from hell i spoke to the iberostar wedding planner and manager of the iberostar bavaro they fired the waiter and offered to give my husband and myself a free 5 day stay but what about the bride and groom their wedding day is forever gone and marked by humiliation and disappointment the iberostar bavaro is a beautiful resort the food is fabulous , the beach breathtaking and the grounds and rooms immaculate go there to vacation but do not get married there 
beware of sankies my family and i have stayed at the bavaro resort a number of times the grounds are absolutely beautiful , the rooms and public bathrooms are very clean and well maintained the food was also very good we initially loved the animation team and the entertainment they provided during our stays we actually got pretty close with a couple of the guys we heard all of the sad stories about their sick mothers , wrecked cars , difficulty providing for their families , broken phones , etc after doing some research on the internet and talking with other tourists , we soon learned that these folks are big time scam artists they normally prey on members of the opposite sex they quickly put the moves on you , ask to maintain contact even after your vacation is over and once they make that initial contact let the scamming begin they will make you think they are in love with you and ca not think of anything else com and search sankies before you go and no matter what , do not believe a word they say 
watch what you eat try to use cash my husband and i spent our 10 year anniversary when we arrived the hotel staff was not that friendly we were not offered a drink , as other guests where upon arrival to the room , we thought the room was very nice the grounds were also beautiful except for the stagnant pond neer the dining room the second day of our trip , my husband became ill with tourista i had to cancel reservations to the restaurants i was told i had to come to the reservation desk to reschedule , they needed a receipt the third day of our trip , i became ill overall the experience was not great the food was bad the service ok beach was beautiful when we returned home we were called from our credit card company that there had been fraud like spending on two credit cards the hotel was where we used these cards apparently there is some way you can copy a card , because we did not loose them 
still have stomach problems i stayed at the iberostar from july 11-18 and went with a group of 40 for a wedding the wedding was beautiful - the staff was very attentive and the florist and photographer were great the pool was lots of fun and the we had no problems getting drinks at the pool bar on the downside , there was not alot of variety when it came to the food the breakfast food was so oily i just ate fruit after the first 2 days the buffets offered the same things each night and the restaurants were just ok compared to some other all - inclusive resorts i have stayed at many of us got sick from the food and either just ate bread or had no choice but to deal with diarrhea the whole time 3 days back from our trip and most of us are still having stomach problems comparing this hotel to other chains i have stayed at , i would definitely never stay at an iberostar again - nor would i recommend it to anyone 
do not drink the restaurant water my husband and i took our 3 kids to the iberostar bavaro from june 5 - june 12, 2008 we had done a lot of research and were excited with our choice after our trip , we wish we would have gone somewhere else let me say that we 're really not that picky maybe we just had some bad luck , but here is what happened to us you can take it or leave it the hotel itself is pretty nice we had gone to the majestic last year and preferred the pool , bars , rooms , etc there over the iberostar nothing is terrible it 's just not great we had 2 adjoining rooms which was great since we were travelling with the kids the bathrooms , however , smelled horribly of sewage the entire time we were there it was so bad in our kids ' room that they ended up using our bathroom the whole week the lock on our safe got stuck and we had to call maint we also had a problem with the sliding glass door in our kids ' room the lock got stuck and it would not open this happened twice during our stay even though maint had said it was fixed the pool was okay it was a nice size and had a deep end which was a nice extra it did look like it needed a little painting but overall was pretty nice the swim up bar was a waste of time there was rarely a bartender available there they always had to go up to the upper area of the bar to make your drink we figured this out and just started getting out of the water to get served a little faster the water in the swim up bar area also always seemed to have a lot of bugs and leaves floating on top it was almost like the skimmer was not working properly the worst part of our vacation actually happened after our stay we ate at the buffet and the specialty restaurants as well my husband was the only one of the five of us that drank the purified water in the reservation only restaurants we only drank bottled water in the room we brushed our teeth with bottled water also anyway , the day before we left , he started getting sick he had diarrhea for over 10 days after we got home and was so weak he could not go to work after lots of tests , including colonoscopy and stool samples , it was determined that he had gotten a parasite called giardiasis while on vacation ( presumably from the water ) he lost 14 pounds in 10 days , his potassium and calcium levels dropped so low that he was hospitalized for 4 days they had to have him on an iv and a heart monitor because they were afraid he 'd go into cardiac arrest to the low levels he 's now been on flagyl for almost 2 weeks and is trying to help his body recover he even had to talk to the dept of health in our town because the parasite is very contagious do not drink the water do not believe them when they say it 's filtered or purified good things about our stay the beach is gorgeous ( as are most in punta cana ) our kids had a great time playing on the beach the best thing about our stay was definitely the staff the entertainment staff are amazing jp was our buddy our three year old daughter , named baby white by jp , called him her boyfriend by the third day james bond and henry were great as well they definitely made our trip everyone was great with the kids the shows were actually pretty good too the kids also loved the ice cream overall , we could deal with the things that were not great while we were there ( the room , etc we had a good time until my husband got sick it 's been a month and he 's still recovering please be careful if you choose to visit the iberostar bavaro if we had to do it all again , we 'd go back to the majestic instead of the iberostar ( but we 'd try to convince jp and the others to join us : ) 
good week at the bavaro this was our 5th all - inclusive we requested an upper floor room with king - size bed , close to the beach - we got our request , room 1317 right at the beach the beach in punta cana is awesome now for the details rooms - decent the bed was a bit too hard and had a hump in the middle - as if it were two beds pushed together flat screen tv was good we did have problems with our air conditioning - it never got cool , and i mean below about 80 when we first checked in i called the front desk to report the problem someone came out within 20 minutes , but all he said was i fix it tomorrow well , tomorrow came and it never got fixed we just dealt with it in addition , the fridge was not very cold either room did have a clock/radio decor was a bit worn - it was time for a make - over we tipped a little bit the first coupledays , however , i did not feel we got anything extra i understand these people do not make much money so a little bit can go a long way we did ask for more beer and water which was replaced as requested pool/pool bar - it was nice was not the best pool i 've been to but it served its purpose the swim up bar was nice did not really use it as much as i thought we would ( we are more beach people ) food - buffett ( breakfast and lunch ) - quality of food was pretty good japanese , la copula ( gourmet ) , mexican , mediterranean , and steak house restaurants were all very good it was not difficult after 3 pm to reserve additional restaurants - - as a matter of fact , we were able to reserve a restaurant for each of our 5 nights gourmet and japanese were the best one last thing about the restaurants , being stuck in long - pants , i thought the restaurants were not very cool tempature wise beach - beautiful you could walk miles and miles and not be haggled we did play the towel game - got up each morning around 8 am and went out to reserve a palapa , which was not a problem at that time of day it gets pretty darn hot on the beach so i 'd suggest reserving a palapa on one of the 1st two rows closest to the ocean we saw more topless women in pc than any other resort area we 've been too - not that there 's anything wrong with that - ) overall - we liked this resort the property alone was worth going to see there were excursions you could do however , we just relaxed we would go back to punta cana but would probably stay in an adults only resort i want to say hi to the very nice ohio couple 's we met - lucky them , there rooms were cool 
i just do not get the rave reviews before i left i read all the raving reviews and picked this resort because of them i swear i just do not get it i do not consider myself overly fussy , but i would never go back again here are the specifics ( and i promise to give credit where i think it is due ) : arrival - no problems some confusion about transportation but that was our travel agent 's fault the bus ride to resort was bumpy due to the very bad roads but at least it was air conditioned did not like having to stop at two other resorts first but i expected it check in - what a joke our travel agent made requests for us , i emailed ahead of time , and we offered money - all to no avail the room and location we wanted was not available we settled for second choice but had to change rooms the second day - ugh room - as pictured on their website the bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were beyond awful word to the wise - pack your own pillows the bathroom 'business area ' is indeed very tight and my fully grown son felt very squeezed in the air conditioning was sporatic - sometimes very cool other times quite uncomfortable the room itself was quite spacious i did not really notice a musty smell while i was there but i can tell you there is a smell in my clothes that i promise you is still there after a washing maid service - maid kept the room clean , but generally did not respond to notes or requests and we tipped $10 the first day hoping to avert that problem , without success fridge was stocked , but the temperature rarely went above lukewarm pool - very nice the bartenders there were some of the ( only ) friendly people we encountered at the resort the swim up bar is fun we had no trouble finding chairs in the shade at any hour ocean - did not spend alot of time there but the beach was beautiful and the sand is indeed like sugar looked like palapas in the shade were generally available restaurants - another joke we were supposed to get three reservations in the inside restaurants we tried to book the first day we were there and were only able to get reservations on two nights - and had no choice of restaurants or nights the aggravating part is the restaurants were usually half empty when we looked in ( or closed - they rotate nights ) the food inside was a step up from the buffets buffets - they make the best bread i 've ever had , and their breakfasts are ok after that it was really a crap shoot some food good some awful , and i do mean awful anyone who raves about the buffets obviously does not mind all of the flies landing on the food which is sitting out often with no refrigeration drink the water - tried to avoid the old montezuma 's revenge but half of our party succumbed by the fourth day despite precautions the other half was fine i was one of the first half service overall - i can honestly say that i found 1/3 of the people to be very friendly 1/3 of the people to be rather indifferent or just not understanding how to provide service , and 1/3 of the people downright surly and i tried hard not to be the 'ugly american ' - i always am polite and friendly to staff there is a real lack of english speaking there , but then again i am no wiz at spanish activities - if you 're into water sports or aerobics or stuff like that i guess there were some i personally found little to do we had a joke with our family - during the day there was mostly just the three s 's : swim , swill beer , and swelter in the heat and omg was it hot and humid two of the seven days there was a breeze which made it bearable the remainder of the days it was like stepping into a sauna i am from the north and this was hard for me ( although great for swimming nightime activities - the casino is small , reeks of smoke , and i am pretty sure the table games are fixed i love casinos but i spent only ten minutes in this one the bars are primarily outside - ok on the breezy nights but pretty stiffling on the others the shows were ok - did not expect cruise ship or lv quality and got what i expected shopping - do not bother many of the merchants were the rudest people we met and we felt they were really scamming us about the money situation and there were really very few shops to go to but there are a couple nice ones in - between the resorts did not go off - site for shopping - do not think there is much excursions - took the day long (7:00am to 6:00 pm ) excursion to altos de chavon , the cave , and the lunch raft ride it was fun during the visiting part but we spent 5 hours ( yes , 5 hours ) on a bus there and back on mostly very bumpy bad roads i swear to you my tail bone hurt the next day i would not recommend this particular tour just due to the long bus ride overall - if you are a beach freak , or love to swim day after day after day and you do not really care much about food or drink quality , go for it - the beach is truly great but if you do care or like to do things off - site , go somewhere else 
sit and relax my family of 4 just returned from iberostar bavaro in pc and here is my take of the resort i must admit when we arrived on saturday june 21st i wasn?? completely thrilled with my choice of vacation spots later on that week i realized that i was just uptight and really needed the peace and tranquility that this vast resort offered although my husband wasn?? particularly happy with the fact that we had to make reservations for the specialty restaurants it wasn?? as easy as everyone had mentioned since for some reason the only open reservations were for 9:00pm which is far too late for me and my family after pursuing the issue a little further we got what we wanted cajun ( jumbalaya ) ? i enjoyed the main meal ( try the flank steak ) and the service was ok until a large party of hotel executives arrived and we weren?? even offered a glass of water never mind coffee after dinner it looked like the secret service moved in and took over the restaurant another point is that even though it was a sit down dinner appetizers and deserts were still buffet style oh another thing , my husband noticed that a maintenance person changed a light bulb over the buffet allowing the dust to settle down thank goodness we had already taken what we had wanted the funny thing about this restaurant is that we really didn?? want to go there but it was the only place available for the time slot we were looking for we ended up enjoying this the most only i warn you after my son just sampled the sushi he was not well for almost 2 days so buyers beware for dinner we all had the tappanyaki which is basically grilled food japanese style we each had a different combination but sampled each others and it was all good try it with the fried rice and you won?? be disappointed the food here was good as well i had the spare ribs which were very good and the service was happy and personable they offer a salad bar which we didn?? engage in since my husband had the misfortune of finding out they didn?? clean the salad ( lettuce ) with bottled water they must use the local water which didn?? settle well with my husband for about 1 ? days thank god we were able to pin it down right away believe it or not we seemed to be the happiest there we always sat in the same spot so we would be in maria?? section she got to know us so well she knew what we wanted to drink before we even sat down my only complaint about the buffet was that there was no dominican food can you believe it , although i can understand it there are so many different people visiting the resort from so many different places in the world that they tried to please everybody which is not easy ok everybody brake out a $1 or $2 the people or so wonderful and so happy and they want to make you just as happy they really work hard for the money not that they expect it and sometimes they will even appear to be surprised spacious and comfortable the bed is great not hard as i read in previous reviews my sons had the ??oldy? i heard people described i think it is from the water and not the room since when we checked in it wasn?? there i just need to know where they get all this energy in this heat from these people work all day you wake up and they are at the pool generating either an ??lympic? or aerobic class they will always say hello and make sure you are enjoying you stay be careful they can be a little sweet and very strong they can use a little help in this department we ventured off the premises 2 times ? what a blast ziplining with bavaro runners ( bavarorunners - $89 00 each and worth every dollar the people who ran it were very patient and made sure you knew what you were doing it takes about 40 minutes to reach the site and it is not a very comfortable ride but you will enjoy it bavaro splash ? this was a lot of fun the first half of the trip is using a 2 man speed boat and there is a tour of about 20 boats my son drove and they really encourage for you to go as fast as possible i?? not sure but i?? pretty sure there were times that we didn?? even touch the water then they take you to a spot where you snorkel i wasn?? sure if i was going to take part in this but my younger son really wanted to do this so i joined him the water was warm and they gave you fish food which needless to say bought the fish really closed to you what an experience all in all with everything i told you my only complaint is that once i started to relax and get into the resort it was time to go home the week just flew by in a minute 
beautiful resort but beware construction our trip was planned through apple vacations the flight on usa 3000 from baltimore was without delay and very pleasant the check in at the iberostar bavaro went smoothly then we were taken to our room no we were on the first floor and had a terrace the view from our terrace was a three story green canvas wall that was so close you could spit on it on the other side of the wall was a huge construction site for a new resort the construction crew began yelling to each other and banging away at 6:00 a and the large crane did not quit until 11:00 p our hearts sank my husband and i had not been on a trip together for 24 years and looked forward to a tropical getaway this was not what we had dreamed of we paid the front desk staffer a large tip and begged to be moved to another room even though this predicament overshadowed the vacation , we eventually got a second floor room with a garden view and had a fabulous time it 's unfortunate that iberostar would even place guests next to the construction apple vacations apparently keeps it a secret from the travel agents also just take that extra cash with you 
1st dr trip my husband and i vacationed here april 28 to may 3 our impessions : usairways had direct fights from philadelphia which was great the dr government charged us $10 for entering their country which is fine funny note : when you pay the $10 they give you a card you walk 20 ft van was there to pick us up most roads are bumpy there 's a lot of new road construction going on , but none of them seem to connect to each other yet hotel check - in went smoothly room was good size and very clean when we opened our patio curtins there was a beautiful peacock sitting the wall i did not notice the damp smell except in the sofa cushions when you sat there i never really noticed it in my clothes while there however , once we were home and everything had been laundered , i could smell it in all my clothes resort is well maintained constant grooming going on every day the buffets and restaurants were always clean and someone was on duty sweeping and wiping during all meals buffet offers many different options quality was typical buffet standard we went to the reservation restaurants for dinner more for the service than difference in food however , the gourmet restaurant has a great steak and the meal presentation is very nice resort staff was very nice we did not run into anyone who was not friendly they seem happy in their jobs i agree with other reviews that it really helps if you can use a few words of spanish it is appreciated the beach is huge we did have to save chairs in the shade by 8:00am even though it says it 's prohibited we never had a problem at the pool most days the ocean was a little rough the sand is like powder sugar and very easy to walk on all the palapas are grouped together it felt a little claustrophobic for being on a beach the sun was strong i normally wear 15-30 spf , but found i needed the 45 my husband uses their social directors were geat they made sure you knew what was going on , but never pushed if you showed no interest in participating warning : all the walkways are very slippery when damp i saw several people fall i never wore anything but rubber sandals dress code is very laid back also , the beach is topless many , young and old , europeans seemed to prefer that the casino at the neigboring hotel is not worth the time i tried to be careful , even brushing my teeth w/bottled water , but i did get tourista stomach on the 4th day after 1-1/2 weeks it still is not back to normal my husband claims it was probably the salad i ate a lunch that day it was an interesting new experience i 'm not sure i 'd go back , but i think my husband would 
safe was stolen first , let me start by saying that i would have given this resort an excellent rating had our safe not gotten stolen it was our honey moon and this resort is absolutely beautiful and the staff is wonderful we booked our vacation through apple vacations , nothing special just knew a lot of people who used them we stayed in room 2371, close to the pool and one row back from the beach it was a nice location , but apparently someone had an eye on our room we checked in on monday 4/14 and were scheduled to leave on sunday 4/20 well , on saturday 4/19 we left our room at 1:30 to go to eat , swim , and lay on the beach for our last day we returned to the room at 4:30 and noticed that someone had taken a crowbar and stolen the whole safe out of our room in our safe was all our money , credit cards , cell phones , jewelry , and passports we immediately contacted the front desk and they were at the room within minutes we also called our apple rep who was at the resort at the time ( carlos ) and he basically said that he spoke with his boss and said it was not their problem and that we would have to take it up with the hotel he never even called to check on us after all this happened to see if we were okay he was a waste of our time the hotel immediately took over and made sure we were taken care of they sat down with us to cancel all our credit cards and cell phones and helped us contact the us embassy in santo domingo to find out what we needed to do about getting new passports the embassy informed us that we would not be able to leave as scheduled the next day since we did not have passports and told us we would have to go to the embassy to get new ones so , the hotel scheduled for a security guard ( castro ) and a guy from guest servies ( james ) to drive us 4 hours to santo domingo to get new passports on monday the ride was really long and extremely bumpy , but we did get to learn a lot about the dr while we were gone , katty in guest services worked on our airline tickets to get those transferred so we could leave on tuesday in the meantime , between sat and tuesday , the hotel did everything they could to make our stay as pleasant as possible they took us to the store on the property and told us to get whatever we needed and they also gave us some cash so we could do whatever we wanted they also scheduled for us to have dinner at the restaurants that require reservations for the next three nights on tuesday morning before we left , we met with the director of the hotel and he gave us cash ( more than the value of the items in our safe ) and a free 7 night vacation to any of their resorts in the caribbean or mexico so , all in all everything turned out just fine and this could have happened to anyone staying at any resort if you would like details of the resort : check in : when we arrived at the hotel we were greeted right away and given a frozen drink while we checked in they origninally put us in room 1066, which was right beside the construction we walked to our room and the bellboys brought our bags to our room by golf cart about 5 min the room really was not that bad , but i requested a room change because i wanted to be closer to the other two iberostar resorts ( dominicana and punta cana ) the next day they moved us to 2371, which was right the middle of everything room : the rooms are very spacious , but my only complaint was the extra small bathrooms the shower was a good size and it has a separate tub , but the toliet area was super small so small in fact i do not know how a larger person could fit in there our a/c worked great and we did not really have any bad smells like other people have said we tipped our cleaning lady everyday until our room got broken in to and left her notes as to what we needed if you can , try to book an upstairs room most of the sliding glass doors will pop right open if you lift it up and pull on them kind of scary if you are on the bottom floor ( like we were ) and we think that is how they got into our room to steal our safe restaurants : we made our reservations the day we got to the hotel it is much easier to make them right away so you make sure you get to eat where you want we were supposed to only have 2 reserved dinners since we were oringinally staying 6 nights we asked if we could have another one and they had no problem giving it to us the hotel gave us three extra dinners after everything that happened , so we ate at the restaurants 6 out of 8 nights we had the gourmet twice ( amazing food must try the filet ) , the japanese twice ( definitely a must eat ) , mexican was pretty good , and jumbalaya/cajun was average ( they did have a good sirloin though ) on one of the nights we did not have reservations , we ate at soft rock cafe which is like a sports bar and it serves american fare food i must say that it was pretty good the other night we ate at the buffet it was tropical night and it was terrible we had a really hard time finding something than even looked appealing they did have a guy in the corner who would make you a ribeye , which it what we ended up eating as for food during the day , we usually ate by the pool and there was always a variety of food you can always find something to eat there you have to realize that you are in another country and foods do taste different , so just enjoy being able to experience something different we heard some people say they had upset stomachs , but it did not seem to affect us any pool : the pool is really big and it has a swim up bar we spent a lot of our time there the staff that works at that bar have so much fun singing and dancing the whole time , while having a drink with you there are a lot of kids in the main part of the pool , but there are not as many on the bar side of it tips : we tipped all the time the cleaning lady , bartenders , waiters and people at reception who helped us the resort also has golf carts that will take you anywhere you want to go around the resort we took them a bunch and we tipped a $1 or $2 every ride beach : the beach here is just gorgeous white sand beach , clear blue water , and a nice breeze to keep you cool we never really had a problem find beach chairs and we usually layed on the beach near the little snack bar usually everyday around 4 or 5 there is a wedding on the wedding right near the snack bar it 's pretty cool to watch there topless women on the beach they are pretty much everywhere , laying out , walking down the beach , etc after you see it a couple of times it 's no big deal excursion : we booked the marinarium tour through the apple rep at the resort you board a catamaran and ride around for about 20 min and they take you to a roped off area in the ocean you jump off the boat and swim over to the blocked off area that has nurse sharks and stingrays this was so awesome the sharks and stingrays were about 3 or 4 feet below you take an underwater camera , you would not want to miss these pictures it was a great experience and would do it over again in a heartbeat 
bad service from front desk my family and i stayed here for our fourth iberostar trip the first three trips being in mexico this resort was just ok grounds very nice and clean food slightly below average , but the wait staff is wonderfulfront desk terrible our air conditioner was not working the entire week , we called the front desk three times , the first two times they sent t two people to fix the probelm we were then told two times the air conditioner was fixed , but it still did not work it was extremely uncomfortable since it was very hot  humid in our room it was especially difficult for our two asthmatic children , that were having dificulty breathing , even with their medication the third time we called the receptionist they said would fix the problemelm again and this time no one even came to fix this problem i asked for a manager to call back that night and a call was never returned check out our bus was suppose to pick us up at 5:45pm our checkout was at 12pm we asked the fron desk if we could check out later in the afternoon since our children had asthma issues the front desk told us we can check out at 1pm because the resort was full , which is hard for me to believe because our luggage was sitting outside the room till 4:30pm and the resort did not seem full at all while waiting for the bus we asked the front desk if they can put us in any air conditioned room after them seing our three year old coughing from asthma and they told us their was no place they can put us as they did not even seem to care at all we spent hours in the resort 's public bathroom trying to keep our children cool we will never stay at this resort again as we are still shocked on how the front desk treated us this is by far no a 5 star resort 
beach was great , the resort was just ok our problems with iberostar bavaro came the first night we checked in i planned a trip to the dominican republic for my husband 's 30th birthday when we got to our room we noticed that we were in a room with two single beds ( even though i had specifically booked a king ) and the window in our room faced a loud construction site when i tried to change the room ( i told them i had booked a king since we are married ) they told me they had no other rooms but that they could switch us the next day since they screwed up on my reservation i asked that they give my husband a birthday cake in our room ( for my husband ) as a small compensation to which a man named rafael at the front desk shook his head and promised exemplary service but no cake honestly i thought a cake was the least they could do since they screwed everything up oh , and our bags arrived at our room 45 minutes after we got to the room , we might as well have carried them ourselves the bell boys told us sorry and waited for a tip that they did not get the next day we switched rooms and there was no exemplary service as promised , just a room with a king and a better view of a walkway is customer satisfaction no longer a big deal for hotels i mean , seriously , they did not give a crap that they screwed up our reservation anyways , the resort is nice enough , the beach is amazing the room smelled musty though and my husband got some sort of food sickness on the last day of our trip ( something that he said was brewing for a few days on account of the food it was not great ) all of the people who worked at the front desk of this resort were so unhelpful - when you asked a question you 'd often get a blank stare and the questions we asked were easy - like , where is the cajun restuarant when we booked a dinner reservation via the concierge they were so unfriendly and forgot to mention that men have to wear pants to dinner , so , of course , my husband had to run back to the room to change when we showed up for dinner i stayed at the riu palace in mexico a few years ago and we had a great time and the experience was so different as i was sitting on the beach at iberostar bavaro i was wishing i had booked the riu for this trip i 've learned to stick with what you know and like 
very ill from salmonella - iberostar bavaro traveled to iberostar bavaro march 1 - march 8, 2008 with 9 people in our party including 5 children first i will say that it was a beautiful hotel and grounds - beach was lovely and the food was good - or at least i thought - until the friday before i came home i became very very sick we left on the saturday and the plane ride home was awful once home i received medical attention and shortly after i received word from our public health department that i had contacted salmonella - i was interviewed and the only - only - food i ate was at iberostar i was also the only one in my party to get sick i only started to feel better a month later the part that makes me most concerned is the lack of interest in the part of iberostar i have emailed the hotel and even phoned but no one has called/emailed back they just do not seem to care - which makes me think that it is not important to them - although they seem to care very much when we were there i am not worried so much about myself - but if one of my children got this sick i would be very very worried and mad 
hmmmmmmmmmmmm 5 star great snorkling right off beach food is plentiful mold in rooms is a problem you and your clothes will come home with a stench from the rooms grounds are fantastic service is good unless a superior is in the same line they will get servedd first hours of shops are limited bring a clock or watch refuse a room with mold it 's hot away from the beach air conditioning is non existent they must use swamp coolers nothing you can do sprays just hide the smell wo not fix problem

i 've seen better this was the first time my fiance , his mother and father , two sisters , and my brother have been to a resort in punta cana , dominican republic the travel agency we booked with , funjet , rated the hotel as five star - but i would give it the equivalent of two stars all the rooms open to the outside - which is typical of central american resorts , so that was fine however , the views were terrible they have the balconies face each other instead of the ocean the room had a small bathroom with very old fixtures the hair dryer could not even dry my hair i would definitely recommend bringing your own shampoo , conditioner , and hair dryer the bed was extremely uncomfortable , and i had to put pillows under my body to make it seem like i was not sleeping on the floor do not expect to watch too much tv either , as it is very small and only provided 5 us stations there was only a closet - no dresser - to store clothes , and the hangers were the kind where you have to detach the hanger part ( ie - it was a pain to hang clothes ) this was an all - inclusive resort , but the food and drink were terrible we have been to other resorts , and they are generous with liquor and the food was good this place not only used generic , cheap liquor , but they were very stingy with their pours the food was also terrible they consistently overcooked all the meats and fishes the foods are more for a european audience ( ex : hamburgers for breakfast ) than american we tried to go outside of the resort and look at some of the country side we asked how much it would be to rent a car and the front desk told us $100 while we were on our way to the airport - i saw a sign that said we could rent a car for $45 this country tries to sneak as much money away from americans as they can lastly , i had an accident while kayaking and ended up breaking my nose ( yep - it broke we had to go to two emergency rooms and a follow - up visit this country wants americans for their money they first asked for our passports , then where we were staying only after they received that information would they charge us for the treatment , x - ray , etc they charge based on nationality and how much they think you have - not fair pricing when we tried to dispute a ridiculous charge , they basically had a guard ( with a gun ) hold us and force us to sign the credit card slip ( which is not illegal to not sign ) my recommendation is to never go to the dominican republic ever again the country is just trying to take as much money as they can from americans and tourists in general 
disappointing stay from dec 20-27, 2007 i am going to keep this review simple we have traveled a lot and have stayed at several all - inclusive resorts in addition to cruising i must say that our expectations were not met beach was amazing , average quality snorkeling right in front of the hotel hotel grounds are expansive and well groomed , however it is a long walk to anywhere the roaming peacocks were beautiful food was poor , in fact , one of our family members was taken by ambulance to the hospital and hooked up to i the last day of our holidays and we were uncertain if she would be able to fly home with us flies were abundant in all food service areas not just open air spaces drinks were marginal unless you ordered beer they were way too strong and i am canadian , we like a strong drink the frozen drinks were all from slushy machines and very sweet check - in smooth except that out of the group of 12 travellers and 6 rooms , 8 of us had to be moved the next morning because of the strong smell of sewer disinfectant/deodorizer  three rooms because there was no air conditioning it does not sound like a big deal , but we did not get any sleep that first night packing up and moving rooms cost us a lot of vacation time our replacement rooms were new , spacious and comfortable without any unpleasant odors and air conditioning was fully satisfactory in order to get a towel you either had to produce a towel card or another towel so if you happened to forget your towel card in your room , you had to walk back to your room or go without this is the last thing you should be worried about on a vacation entertainment was enthusiastic but lacking substance good family fare i suppose excursions , we only took one , marinarium ( snorkeling with nurse sharks and rays ) snacks were build your own sandwiches out of dry bread , piece of cheese and ham mustard mayo and ketchup via squeeze bottles snorkeling was better at the hotel what a disappointment for $83 per person price tag no fins so it was hard to swim because you are always fighting the current and waves we expressed our disappointment respectfully , and they did make amends by giving each couple a bottle of rum diving , weather conditions were poor for diving so no fault to dressel divers , the sites were limited professional and very accommodating staff four stars to the dive shop we ended up coming away with a credit for dives that were paid for in advance but were unused due to conditions staff were friendly , and responded well to any attempt you made to communicate with them in spanish we left the dominican republic with disappointing reviews of our hotel but with lots of fond memories of vacationing with family and friends we will continue to travel and it is unlikely that we will return to the dominican unless they produce a good 5* quality resort like a sandals property 
it was all right this is a very honest review my husband , my 18 year old and myself traveled there from oct 7- oct 14, first time in dom rep with gogo vacations the weather is great , people are nice and friendly but everywhere yu go you gotta tip i really dont understand how people can give a 5 for this resort yes , it is beautiful , the grounds are nice and clean , the people are friendly , but it is not a 5 star resort maximum i would give this resort is 3 5 stars - no more first of all the rooms are plain ugly and smell bad , there 's is an ugly comforter on the bed which feels like it is made out of wood , there are no ocean front or oceanview rooms , all i saw was an ugly construction and a green smelly garden next to my balcony , no jacuzzi tab in the bath and no jacuzzi in the pool area either , only in the spa on the dominicana side , their shampoo gave me an irritable itching and the soap does not smell good and dried my skin , but that aside i took everything with me as soon as we arrived i ordedred room service , which i thought was convinient , but it tasted like crap and you really dont have a lot to choose from - the same menu every day , no breakfast menu and no beverages ok so we went to the buffet , again another dissapontment , it was almost 7:30 pm but it seemed that they already finished restocking the buffet because it looked empty , only one choice of fish , chicken and meat , really nothing to choose from , i only had some desert and fruit and pretty much went to bed hungry the buffet wa sthe same every day , not much changed and not many selections , the breakfast buffet was really good , but lunch and dinner really bad we tried the steak house and middeteraneo , i liked the steak house etter , at mediteraneo service sucked , was very slow and it didnt taste that good my toddler reall didnt have much chouce to eat and lost weight during the vacation , one more thing - their cribs that they provide are not safe i didnt use it even once , he slept with us all 7 nights , the crib is very shaky - did not seem safe to me at all the pool is nice and the beach is of course beautiful the nightly shows are boring , only liked the friday and saturday show i really hope you would consider my review before making your decison , it is 100% honest , i have been to mexico and jamaica before and this vacation was the worst vacation so far , if you are traveling as a couple go to secrets excellence , as a family with kids , i would suggest palladium resorts in riviera maya if you still decide to go , good luck , i hope you wont be dissapointed 
what am i missing well , i 'm going to surprise some people who are used to glowing reviews of this place , almost all of them 5 0- - that 's what led me to book the #2 hotel in punta cana i must tell you first that my kids and i are club med junkies , and this was my 4th trip to punta cana and my only time outside of the club med the only reason we left the club med after 5 nights was that i 'd booked my trip last fall using aadvantage miles for 11 days , then come to find out afterwards that club med was closed because an italian company had rented out the entire place from june 2-7, right during the last half of my trip so i was forced to find another hotel after , as usual , a fantastic time at cm , we arrived at the iberostar only to find out that my travel agent had booked the iberostar punta cana and not the bavaro as i had requested , based on traveller reviews here i had read the documents and assumed that it said iberostar punta cana simply because that was the city it was in also , i 'd made the reservation last feb or so and simply did not remember the names of the other hotels next door when i was sent the travel documents a few weeks before departure my biggest word of advice is to double check this - - an honest mistake made by my travel agent because the names are so innocuous so , anyway , we arrive only to find out that we are in the other hotel , and by the faces of the front desk clerks , which is considered low rent i ask what the difference in cost is between the two and am told $480 for our 5 night stay based on myself , my 18 yr old son , and my 14 yr we ask to see a room , it looks fine , and we 're told that the other hotels have much worse rooms and that you ca not use the dining facilities at the bavaro if you are staying in the punta cana or dominicana so i got out my visa card well , we 're taken to the other side of the property from where they 'd shown us the sample room just as close to the beach , and i do not really pay attention to the hammering going on in the group of villas nearby every single morning , beginning at 8:30 am and lasting till at least 7:30 pm , there is construction , drilling , hammering so loud you want to scream it woke us up every morning , even on sunday the room next to us and below us were also under construction so they started pounding at 10 am there , but only on the first 2 days i would 've requested a room change except i was too busy throwing up the 2nd day yes , after one meal here ( dinner at the buffet ) , i got horrible food poisoning the following morning , could not leave the room all day , and finally called for a golf cart to take me to the doctor in the other hotel at 6 pm they were very nice , gave me an iv because i was so dehydrated , lots of medicine including some just in case such and such happened , told me not to pay until i came back the next day ( although they had told me it would be a $90 consultation fee ) i might point out that they also could not believe it was really food poisoning , suggesting that it was from traveling , until i pointed out that i 'd already been in the dr for 6 days never once have i gotten ill at a club med anyway , so i go back the next morning , feeling much better , to get another iv and to pay the bill i did not need the sos pills , still in their unopened wrapper , for nausea but was unable to give them back as it was against policy from the pharmacy the grand total came to $272 for the hotel giving me food poisoning because it could not be proved , i had no recourse let 's see , the pluses : grounds are very beautiful , beach is beautiful , there is always food somewhere , rooms fairly spacious the bartenders and waiters are so happy they are always smliing , singing , and dancing they are definitely the best part of the place i did not want you to think i was totally negative more minuses , however : i had not read that men had to have pants in order to go into the sit - down restaurants since my son iis 18, he qualified as a man well , it is litterally 90 degrees and 94% humidity at that time of year , so we have never brought pants this is the same place where people are wearing bikinis without cover - ups at lunch so here we had 2 qualifying nights for the a la carte restaurants and could not use them yes , we could 've bought him some $70 pants in the boutique , but i was pretty fed up about having spent $752 by my 2nd day there we were able to go to the steak restaurant ( the only one where you do not have to wear pants that has table service ) and i could only swallow 2 bites of my rib eye shoe leather is more tender i feared the others would be as bad , so i did not bother with the pants the food is very plentiful , well presented , and horrible again , i hate to compare it to club med , which has fantastic food , but i felt very guilty taking food from the buffet and not being able to eat it some things were great , but they were few  far between also , they close the beach bar at 6 pm we could not do anything at night because we knew that we would be awakened at 8:30 by the construction and , prior to that , the damn peacocks screeching at 6 am not that the shows were so good that we did not mind leaving after 15 mins they were pretty bad maid service was spotty i requested another pillow and nothing ever showed up i asked again the next day and got it our 2nd to last day , the maid only gave us 2 bath towels i called for 2 more , and never got them room service is prompt ( when i could not leave the room , we all had stayed in for dinner , not that i ate ) , but the menu is very limited and they do not bring drinks i took one step class with broken down reebok steps right on the side of the pool the teacher had some woman ( guest ) from the u teach it for her , and i do not think she ever taught a class before plus , the real teacher did not know how to work the music , so we stopped after each song the class lasted 20 mins because she could not figure out the cd player it was a blessing to end it , however last thing : on our day of departure , we were supposed to be in the lobby at 11:35 for our shuttle to the airport i called for a golf cart to get our luggage that never showed up finally , at 11:30, my kids and i ran with the suitcases only to find out that the bus had left without us after much scrambling ( our gogo tours rep was , naturally , in the other hotel at this point ) , they found us another tour company 's shuttle who took us to the airport i saw someone there with an iberostar bracelet like ours and asked if they had been on the bus they said yes , but that the bus had left early and they had held it up by getting there at 11:30 let that be another warning to you they 'll leave you , even if you 're early if anything , i expected a dominican tour bus to be late , not early that 's fine , i guess , but necessary to know , especially if they just up and leave you personally , i hate negative reviews i like knowing that the place i want to go to is fantastic , but that 's what i was led to believe by everyone else 
beautiful facilities , inconsistent food/service my wife and i stayed at the ib four nights during our friends ' wedding weekend our visit started great with very prompt shuttle service ( through a private tour company ) and a warm welcome to the resort by reception staff we received an informative overview of the resort , a tropical beverage , and were invited to our room (1161) while our bags were handled by the bell staff the facilities here are beautiful - - peacocks roam the grounds ( more on them later ) , flamingos wade in ponds , the gardens are perfectly maintained , and the rooms are spacious and well - appointed the fantastic pool is the focal point of the resort , but we spent most of our time on the beautiful beach with powder soft sand and crystal clear waters our only issues with the resort stem from our interactions with the staff and the food first , reservations are required for the specialty restaurants at the resort ( reservations are not required for the buffet restaurant ) the guest services staff are unfriendly at best they keep irregular hours and are very unaccommodating to large groups and changes to reservations when attempting to make a reservation at the french restaurant , the staff person thought i said the fish restaurant and gave me a reservation at the mediterranean restaurant by mistake when i went back to resolve the issue he refused to believe i said french and not fish and by that time reservations at the french restaurant were not available of course , we found out later that the restaurant was in fact half - empty because so many people make reservations and then do not keep them thankfully , the mediterranean restaurant was very good the japanese restaurant was not good the buffet is expansive and caters to several nationalities ' tastes , but overall quality was poor service at the restaurants was also spotty although the resort is all - inclusive , they do not make it easy to get what you want ordering anything other than the house wine requires a negotiation and at least a few requests other than our restaurant - related issues , most of the staff are energetic and friendly the guys advertising resort activities on the beach can get a little too persistent and the impromptu performance art ( for lack of a better term ) are a little odd for instance , out of no where one day a guy dressed as a peacock comes running down the beach chased by a guy dressed as a chef wielding a knife the peacock grabbed my wife and hid behind her as the chef approached then they ran off to annoy other guests speaking of peacocks , they are beautiful and exotic , but they crow like roosters on steroids at daybreak bottom line , ib is a beautiful place i recommend the specialty restaurants over the buffet , but make your reservations early in the day and avoid interactions with the staff for the sake of your blood pressure 
my husband , two teenage sons and our 2 year old just returned from the iberostar bavaro in punta cana first i will say that the grounds are immaculate the landscaping is absolutely gorgeous and the people there are so very friendly and really work hard a couple we had met there spoke with one of the girls that was working and said she works 12 days on -12 hours a day , stays at the resort and then has 3 days off i would really like to know how much she is paid these kids are there when you get your breakfast and at dinner - it was crazy i was very unhappy with the room that we stayed in we had adjoining rooms very close to the beach which was really convenient but the rooms were run down first floor rooms are not updated the bed was horrible we requested a king bed and they put two doubles together you will need a massage just because the mattress is so awful when we arrived the toilet did not flush , there was not a crib in my room as i requested , also we requested a non smoking room which it was not because there was an ashtray on the table - - - alot of smokers here too but the worst part was my son 's luggage was missing after many calls to the front desk ( which i kept getting the iberostar dominicana 's front desk ) my kids went for a walk and found the luggage on one of the pathways there are alot of europeans and they like to go topless my sons 13 and 15 felt a little ( lot ) awkward especially when people would ask my boys to take their topless picture there is no top shelf liquor they have normandy brand liquor and it is totally weak i could not find a drink the entire week i was there that i could actually say i liked the pina coladas on the beach are on ice the restaurants require pants except at the steak house they would not serve us at the japanese restaurant because my boys did not have long pants on ridiculous considering it is 90 degrees if you stay at the resort for seven nights you can have 3 guaranteed reservations at the gourmet restaurants we at at the couples restaurant and liked it alot the steak house was good also and then we did eventually get into the japanese restaurant with jeans on in my opinion i would much rather see a man wearing a pair of khaki cargo shorts than jean pants at dinner - - - but that is just me the buffet got really old if i see another buffet i really will be ill the bread and desserts were really good i am glad i went , the weather was amazing and the beach and water were great but it would not be a place i would go back to beaches turks and caicos is much better in my opinion 
not really five - star my husband and i stayed at the iberostar bavaro from jan 27, 2007 to feb 3, 2007 and had fairly high expectations considering reviews we read on trip advisor plus the relative price we paid compared to the other iberostar resorts in punta cana despite being dropped off at the resort at 1:30pm local time , we had to wait two hours before we were let into our room , which was frustrating once we got into the room , i have to admit , i was impressed but , the room was literally the only 5- star aspect of the resort i know when i read reviews that criticized the food , i thought , it ca not be that bad these people are just picky we 'll be fine , but i was wrong i understand that at other all - inclusives , you get to eat multiple dinners and a few other meals in a traditional menu , waiter , a la carte fashion at iberostar , you must eat at buffets for every meal except three dinners i drastically underestimated the effect this can have on one 's vacation experience if you 're into food at all eating the same foods at breakfast , lunch , and dinner off of buffets for seven days got old and the food is definitely geared towards europeans , which to me means no salt , minimal seasoning , and almost no vegetables and if you think you can get your money out of the alcohol , think again no employees walk around offering beverages to people , which means if you want a drink , you have to walk quite a ways to get one the weather was beautiful , and it only rained a little at night while we slept the grounds are also gorgeous and well - maintained we left the resort once to take an excursion to the marinarium , which i highly recommend it was the highlight of our trip bottom line : i thought a european chain such as iberostar would have higher standards for food and service than an all - inclusive geared towards americans it turns out the opposite was true 
cant be #2 rated my sister and i stayed there jan we are in our early/mid the resort itself and the property is very nice we stayed in a newly renovated room , although a standard room , and it was perfect the room had a sitting area and a touch keypad safe there were always workers cleaning the sidewalks and working on the landscape the beach was very nice , too although where we usually sat the ocean floor was rocky - dont know if it was like that along the whole beach area or not had no problems getting a lounge chair at the beach , although it was a little tougher getting one around the pool do not know if this is standard or not when we were there it was extremely windly out at the beach , but not near as bad by the pool so maybe that 's why it was more crowded around the pools the pools were nice swim - up bar was nice had a small pool for little kids and zero - entry in the bigger pools lots of families there drinks were fine the food was bad i am not a picky eater at all , but i have to say i was really sick of the food choices ( or lack - thereof ) for having buffets , there really was not much variety usually i can find stuff to eat at a buffet no problem , but it was difficult here breakfast was really the only good , sure meal the snack bar/restaurant by the pool was the same most of the food was the same every day needless to say , the food got old fast out of all the all - inclusives i 've stayed at (5 total ) this was the worst entertainment was nice there were usually alot of guests crowded in for the entertainment probably because that was the only thing going on in the evenings though this resort was really quiet in the evenings by 4:30 pm it started getting chilly out by the beach ( i mean , you 'd have to cover up with a towel to stay out there ) so shortly after the place was deserted and quiet the iberostar dominicana is right next door ( you dont even have to leave the iberostar property ) and has the disco in the evening which was alot of fun probably the most fun thing to do in the evening oh , there are no hot tubs ( besides the spa that closes at 5pm i believe and you have to sign up for a time slot ) so that was disappointing referring back to the above paragraph where it starts getting chilly at 4:30 would 've been perfect heading to the hot tub really strange that such a big hotel and hotel chain that there was not a couple hot tubs if you use a calling card to call back to the u you will be charged just over a dollar for each connection so know that that will be added to your bill at the end the iberostars ( bavaro , punta cana , and dominicana ) are all connected so you can visit the other two without leaving the iberostar property that was a nice benefit some of the specialty restaurants are located in the dominicana and punta cana we ate at the mediterrano , gourmet and tropical liked the gourmet and mediterrano wish we would 've ate there more make your reservations for the restaurants right when you check in the longer you wait , the more difficult ( if not impossible ) it will be to get in and you have to have a reservation in order to get in even if people dont show up for their reservation and they have room , you still ca not get in there is an enrty fee into the country of $10/person for americans you pay $10 and get a ticket , walk 6-8 steps , hand over the ticket just so you know and are prepared went on the snorkeling excursion ( caribbean festival ) through the funjet rep snorkeling was ok entertainment on the catamaran was far better snorkeled with nurse sharks and huge sting rays kinda hokey because they herd 60 people or so into the pen without flippers of course or else they could not fit that many in it was neat if you 've never seen sting ray or sharks before it was $70/person plus tax all right , the jist of this review is this : bad food , nice beach/pool , nice property , family - friendly , quiet resort 
i would not return i just returned last night from my punta cana experience and overall i was disappointed the first thing you need to do is ask yourself , who am i in order to know if this resort is for you i live in a large urban environment known for its amazing restaurants and have become a bit of a food snob if you are at all a food snob , this place is not for you although i did not go to pc for food , a full seven days of bad meals is a bit tough to take also , residents of darfur receiving un drops are less pushy then the guests at the buffets they were really rude however , the waitstaff was quite friendly considering how impolite many guests were behaving i will say that the water and beach were very nice guests saved seats at the pool and beach which made it quite difficult to find a place to spend the day i would find this to be the case as early as 8:00 am also , you must be able to receive a renovated room i went to this resort because it had the highest apple rating from a tour operator i had to change rooms midway the second room was better , although there was an odor good luck to you in your trip planning 
i would not return to the domincan republic i read all the reviews before we left and most of them sounded o we usually travel to the southern caribbean and after this trip i will continue to visit the southern caribbean islands i new from the begining that the price to go to d r was very afforable since it was all inclusive well you get what you pay for it just seems to me that the people did not care if you were happy or not i also became sick after the third day there place was very clean and they were always cleaning and maintaining the grounds place was beautiful just was to large another thing that really made us mad was that our room was never cleaned until after 4pm i never stayed at a hotel where the maid cleaned the room so late we gave her tips and hoped that she understood what we wanted but it was very difficult to communicate our friends that were with us called the front desk twice with the same problem but nothing was done about it i guess the place really was not for us we ended up checking out a day earlier that planned i just wanted to go home i was to sick to stay any longer 
no bravo for bavaro my husband and i stayed here for the week of thanksgiving with friends we have traveled many times to mexico and jamiaca we have had much better experiences there i will try to be a simple as i can dr : like any other island iberostar : really disapointed me i have been to others , and they were so nice this one was awful beach : great this is the one shining spot for this resort lots of huts , good sand and surf water was warm pool : only one , lots of kids crowding it up closes at 7 restaurants : the cajun was great buffets never changed , same stuff every day got really boring not a lot of selection service : worst service i have ever had in my life for what you pay for the resort , the least they could do was make sure that your glasses are filled many times we had to fill our own glasses also , even though we are in their country , it would be nice if the resort had people that understood more stuff , like coca - cola sometimes instead of coke i got o or whatever ( that 's when they actually got our drinks drinks were not good , alcohol was cheap service here was awful too seems that the wait staff could care less if you get a drink , or get what you order they want the americans to tip , i heard that tipping is strictly an american thing , but they do not want to do anything to get it the worst i have ever seen put me to sleep i tried it every night , and it was never any good check in/out : very good room : ok cleaning was great flight : take a charter we did and had a much shorter trip then those who did not great service and flight on usa 3000 excursions : friends did the safari with apple said it was great we did the snorkeling with marinarium ( spelling ) it was awful snorkeling was not any good , and if you do go and they tell you you do not need fins , they are lying mostly was just a party boat ride not worth my money bus ride : ok other : do not drink the water our apple rep told us this when we got there , i think that it was wise it stays pretty warm there all year long , so keep that in mind lots of construction/remodeling being done casino was tiny internet was a long hike away spa was good must make reservations to use the jacuzzis 
nice resort , not a big fan of the food this resort was nice but not great we booked a beach front room but did not get one , they said they had none avail while there for 4 nights we lost power two of the nights , no lights , pitch black just our hotel , no one elses there was zero entertainment at night no big t , no music , no shows incredibley boring at night the dinners were pretty good and the buffets were gross my friends and fam 
watch personal items at check - in your told to leave all your baggage inside bag room until room is available the only problem they do not give you ticket and anyone could walk in i noticed security guard local person go in show his friend a kids pair of nike shoes he placed them in bag and left ( good security ) they tell you it is safe to drink the water so i was drinking mixed drinks bad mistake it would have been safer to drink beer its day 5 i 'm still sick talking to few people from buffalo and the were complaining of the same issue i should have checked trip advisor before booking that its was rated #46 the beach was great noticed the person cleaning up the beach area that worked for the hotel grab things under the chairs of guest when they were sleeping on the beach watch your personal items 
i 'll try somewhere different next time the grounds are well kept , the pools clean the maid staff kept our room clean , and were happy to provide extra towels , etc on a small tip daily food is plentiful around the resort and was mediocre , relative to all - inclusives the drinks were weak at the beach , but the bartender in the lobby knew how to mix them up for us although clean , our room accomodations were terrible , and we were refused the double bed room we had booked through our agent i slept on a rollaway for the five days i was there , since we only had one king bed for the other party i was with occidental 's response was that they had no responsibility to provide anything but a room before i knew better , i booked a scuba excursion at the hut at the hotel beach the boat was little and broken down , as was the scuba equipment , and the dives were handled dangerously and unprofessionally then i found a scuba provider ( scubacaribe ) at the resort next door and they are wonderful , clean and professional for any water excursion or activity you may want i would suggest taking a walk down the beach and check them out before you book anything at the occidental or with the reps in their lobby you can find their scubacaribe sign on the beach to the left of the occidental they will take you on scuba/snorkel tours on the other side of the island to catalina or saona and seem to have a larger variety of excursions than what is offered at the occidental 
nice resort - shame about hot water problems overall the place was nice however we had hot water problems throughout first we were in block 25 and every time we go to shower the water would be cold/luke warm we complained they sent around a maintenance guy who checked the water then ??ait 20 minutes and it will be okay? we waited over an hour and same problem we complained again and eventually got moved to block 23 moved here first time the water was hot that afternoon , same problem they sent someone who said to ??ait 20 minutes and it will be hot? waited , same issue complained about 4 more times asking for manager and eventually on the second to last day got moved to their royal club which was excellent again the place itself was nice however this problem and the way they handled it spoilt most of the trip in total we must have complained about 9 times about the water normally we are that too fussy about most things however we do expect to get warm/hot water remember to haggle/bargin on everything , if they won?? budge then you will find someone else selling it this applies to souvenirs and activites 
watch your belongings my husband , baby and toddler daughters and myself booked a 2 week stay ( our annual family trip ) at this resort this year for november as we pulled up to the hotel , we thought wow , beautiful looking place that did not last long we checked in around 10:30pm and at that time , were told that no safe keys were available and to return the next morning for a key we left our room for literally 10 minutes after dropping off our bags and returned to find all of our valuables had been stolen my husband was at the front desk until 3:00am fighting with them to call a manager ( which by the way they do not have on duty at night ) no manager was called , no police were called and we later learned that in fact , 3 rooms in our building ( #25) were robbed we received no compensation and were given the runaround up until the time we left we were sent to another hotel so that the manager , carlos , could have us out of his hair and have the 'problem ' disappear moral of this story - do not stay at this hotel - no one can be trusted between the 3 rooms that were robbed , over $5,000 in money and valuables were stolen not worth the risk 
do not stay at the occidental we were one of the fortunate couples that had a room that wasnt falling apart our good luck stopped there the food was horrible , especially the buffet we mostly ate pizza and tacos from upstairs to survive they have security on the resort but i dont understand why when they allow people to enter the resort from the street this caused us to fall victim to a horrible atm scam since they are not tracking people without wrists bands entering the resort they had no idea who the individual was that tampered with the atm machine on the resort outside of the mongo club when we approcached the resort mgmt to let them know of the problem this seemed to be a regular occurence of cards being eaten by the machine the next morning we went to pick it up and among 6 other bank cards including debit and credit cards the machine had eaten , my card was not there we were robbed on the resort which speaks volumes about their so called security the trip turned into a nightmare in the blink of an eye and the resort did little to help i would not recommend this resort as the beach was the highlight of our trip and was beautiful but there are many resorts along the strip that you could stay at with beach front 
go to the paradisus we have had a great time at other occidental resorts , but this was not worth the money after one night there we transferred to the paradisus punta cana which i would highly recommend also , some of the things that happened was bad luck for us during check - in our reservation was lost after 45 minutes they found it and took us to our room where the key didn?? work after getting another key we found that the room was occupied after going back again we found the right room our first room had wet floors and mold growing on the wall i believe it had been cleaned earlier in the day and not allowed to dry so it was like walking into an old basement lauren is allergic to mold and immediately started sneezing and having trouble breathing when we asked our concierge for another room he did not want to help because he was afraid we were going to go to another building ( each building has a concierge we were told right away that they make a commission off any tours we book so they didn?? want you to use another tour operator we finally left and went to the front desk where the clerk did not want to help and we were brushed off after being told every room was full i found another clerk who was more helpful and was able to find us another room after tipping him he went back and found an ocean front room for us , which turned out to be a big improvement over the first room this whole process took over three hours there?? a disco on the property that plays the music so loud that it sounds like the club is directly outside the room even with all the doors and windows closed our room was facing the beach and the disco is at the other end of the property the music played from 9pm to 1am ( we could hear it walking on the beach at the paradisus , about a half - mile down the beach , the next night the second room was much nicer than the first , but there was still mold growing on the walls , the floor would sweat in places , and the shower had large rust spots lauren was still having sinus problems due to the mold the hotel allows other tour operators on the property every time we went anywhere near the lobby we would be swarmed with people trying to sell us tours you would have to be almost forceful for them to leave you alone we had to get our room key reset two more times during the time we were there the concierge is not able to ask them for a new key so it requires a ten - minute walk each way to the front desk when we transferred to the paradisus many of their employees came from the occidental and asked about our problems as if it was common knowledge we were in our room in less than twenty minutes 
you should stay at the melia from check - in to check - out , the worst trip i have taken in the past 10 years the room smelled moldy , the food tasted like the room the service was by far the worst , even with tips so we stopped my husband puctured his foot with a rusty nail on the beach and i thought the beach was the best part until that happened upper management did care about that either i stayed at the melia last year and loved the melia that is where i should have stayed never go to the occidental grand punta cana 
watch out , bad tast have you gone thru a bad vacation below you will see how terrible vacation i had in last augest 2008 this hotel is very bad there is no hot water for shower the water presure was very low the partio class door was broke and the lock was not working the room was smell chemical water leake from the ceiling the food was bad , there is no consistence on tast althought the service people try to do a good job , but the management systems and the infastructure was their i personally talke to the senior management with all their problems thier atttude was eight you take it or leave it a lot of promisse , but not delevery everything is very slow if you request extra towels or bed it take days or they said it is done , but when check in the room , it was not done 
would not recommend this place my boyfriend and i stayed there aug 2-9, 2008 our room was horrible - smelled like mildew ( could tell where there was a leak and they did a poor job fixing the wall ) and it was fillthy ( especially the bathroom ) we asked for a new room as soon as we got there and they told us there were none available the next day , same thing we had to stay in that room for 2 days until they finally found one after alot of screaming at them we barely ate all week we were only allowed to make reservations for 3 nights at a time lost out on the first 2 days because of the restriction about when you can make the reservations we went back later in the week to make reservations for the remainder of our trip only to find out that the restaurants were all booked for the rest of the week and the food we did eat was not anything special the drinks were watered down and you had to wait forever to even get a drink a big reason you stay at an all inclusive resort is so you do not have to worry about where you are going to have your meals the staff was obnoxious and rude a waiter asked me something in spanish and when i replied that i did not understand him , he said what , you do not know what do you want to drink means with the amount of americans staying there , you would think the staff would speak more english you could not go in or out of the lobby without being stopped by the staff to try to sell you a timeshare we spent more time searching for meals/drinks and making requests over and over for stupid things i could go on and on and on with more complaints , but i am hoping this is enough for people to stay somewhere else 
find a different resort , you can thank me later if you are thinking about going to punta cana , dominican republic - to the occidental resort , my advice is to find yourself a different destination i have been to many developed and undeveloped countries and by far this was my worst experience of any resort if you are the type that needs specifics read on , those we would take the word of a seasoned traveler , start looking for another resort the photos looked inviting on the internet as we booked our summer vacation we , wife and i and two kids - 12 year son and 9 year daughter were excited to spend a week in sunny paradise as we were driven up to the entrance , we did a double take the lobby was run down and unkempt there was no welcoming effort at the resort few dirty glasses were piled up on a dirtier tray by the side of the entrance behind it lay old cooler presumably holding water the lobby was filled with people it was almost four o??lock in the after noon we waited about 35 minutes to get to the front counter the person at the front , appeared over whelmed , there was only one additional help he was unable to locate our reservation at first , after about five minutes of searching around on table filled with prepared envelopes he finally did then he told us that there would be 30-60 minutes wait before our room would be available ??t is being cleaned? was the response as signed posted all around declared that check out time was 12:00 am there was no smile , no apologies , no nothing , as we waited starved and tired from our travel to be assigned a room we asked for help and all we got were pitches on how to return at the occidental for cheaper price - a vacation club sales orientation , finally we were directed to a snack bar to have some lunch , so much for our visions of tropical drinks and exemplary service we received our room assignment as promised upon return we received keys for the room and check out cards for the beach towels the towels were only to be provided upon presenting the card and we were asked to return our four cards or face $20 per missing card fee upon check out after that brief discussion we were driven to our room in a golf cart the property itself appeared aged the property layout was that of apartment condos , 8-10 units in each building there was ample vegetation with mature growth around the property the room itself was large , however , it had a single bed and a pull out sofa we had requested two queen size beds - but were glad to take whatever we got that definitely set the expectations for the remainder of the trip over the next seven days in that room , we experienced three episodes of no water on three different days , each lasting more then two hours this means no shower , and most importantly no flushing , gross the plumbing code needed some upgrading on the entire property as in our room and outside , various areas , there was that indefensible odor of human waste , something that no on should have to experience ever , not just on a vacation trip there were numerous episodes of no hot water when necessary the maid service was good but after the first night we realized that maids would not change the linens except upon guests check out days imagine , young children making a mess in bed with salty water etc and have to sleep in that for the next few days though on the internet i saw that the property was rated 4 stars , i would give it one we rested for a while , and decided to get a relaxed meal at one of the many restaurants the place boasts we went to the italian place upon arriving there we were asked if we had made reservations i shook my head ??o? we were advised that we would need reservation to dine here , and the reservation can only be made before 3:00pm and can be made in the morning for that days dinner plans i protested that we had arrived earlier in the day after three may be it was the frustration in my voice , or the big smile on my wife?? face or the hunger in my kids? eyes or may be he was just a nice guy - he let us dine there the food was two steps below olive garden the service was poor to sum up our dinning experience at the occidental - next day i called at 2:00 pm to reserve and the operator told me i had to make a reservation before noon we attempted to go to the oriental place and we were turned away the restaurant was visibly half empty the following day , i called at 10:30am and was told that reservation had to be made in person at the desk before noon my wife stopped by there to make reservation for the mexican place she was told that it was booked for the next five days she walked away later that morning , i went up to the desk and asked for the same reservation was given the same answer i am not the one to walk away and asked why the place was booked for the next five days when reservations are only accepted for the same day she told me that they now accept reservation for the next three days and gave me slips for the italian , oriental and the brazilian places for the next three evenings but nothing for that day or nothing for the mexican place that i had asked for she suggested that i show up at the restaurant and speak to the manager and take our chances i was not going to fall for it , and asked to speak to the manager after all the huffing and puffing for the next 25 minutes i got what i wanted reservation for the mexican place for the evening in the end , the food was not worth the effort i went through to arrange the plans the place was nearly empty all of the so called restaurants were of poor quality and i would not give them repeat business in my town the pizza place and the taco place were average but service was unreliable as was the food the buffet was decent for being used as the main place to eat there was again smell of the rotting food in the rear part of the dinning area i first hand witnessed poor hygiene and food handling at the buffet from the servers from behind the counter the other two places were - a small snack bar and limited buffet near the beach , again nothing spectacular here to speak of the all inclusive for alcohol was only for domestic selection and was limited let?? talk about the beach experience the beach was spectacular , water was blue green and warm , again employees were not friendly the shaded lounge chairs were always taken , as early as 7:30 am it was not until my last day , when i was out on the beach at 6:00am hoping to catch the sunrise that i saw hotel personal placing towel and magazines on the choicest of locations my guess is , they were either paid the day before or were hoping to collect tips over the remainder of the day from the hotel guests one after noon , i heard music being pumped loud through the speakers near the beach - song being played was ?? am a [ - - - - - - - - - - ] p p by fifty cent 
stay somewhere else upon arrival at the hotel occidental there was astrong storm in progress after check - in we wereinstructed to leave our bags with the bell boy wewere told that our bags would be taken to our room wehowever had to walk in strong rain and gusty winds toour room the walk took us over 15 minutes ( primarilybecause we were unfamiliar with the area and had noguidance ) and we were soaked finally when we didreach our building #25 the bell boy was already there had travelled in a golf cart ) i do not understandwhy we were not offered transportation with the bellboy given the weather conditions we did not have hot or warm water in order to takea shower for the first two days , hence we did notshower for two days at the start of our trip in theevening after our arrival , i attempted to call thefront desk to alert them of this problem no oneanswered the front desk i then walked to thereception desk , no one was at the front desk thefollowing morning on sunday , i again called the frontdesk , no one answered i then walked to the front deskin the lobby and expressed my concern i wasinstructed to go and talk with someone else at anotherdesk after waiting in line for 10 minutes and beingshuffled from person to person having to repeat myconcerns , i informed a woman that my room did not havehot water she stated that she would alert someone iasked for an estimated time in which the problem wouldbe fixed , she could not give me one the entire daypassed and we did not have hot water i inquired twiceagain on the phone and in person in the lobby and wastold that they told someone of note , other guestsdid have hot water on sunday evening also , i notedthat the toilet was no longer working i went again tothe lobby and asked if it was possible that the roombe changed after much discussion and reasons why suchaccommodations were difficult to be made , i wasreluctantly transferred to another room this roomtoo , did not have hot water , but rather lukewarmwater original reservations were made for two beds , there were two adults travelling upon arrival in ourfirst room , there was only one bed i inquired as towhy there were not two beds , and was told that allrooms were booked and that we could only get a cot the cot took a few hours to arrive and was extremelyuncomfortable i asked for an extra pillow and waitedseveral hours for this to arrive when we weretransferred to another room there was one bed we wereagain given a cot on sunday we made reservations for excursionsthrough a tour company and our representative julio earlier on i had expressed my dissatisfaction with thehotel facilities and customer service with the frontdesk and was told to talk with my tour representative i discussed my concerns with julio and he stated that he would talk with the manager and leave a message in our room withalternate resolutions i never heard back from julio on the day of our excursion we were instructed tobring towels for the ( carribean festival ) the towelbooth was not open when i went to ask for beach towelsso i inquired with the front desk we do not havetowels was the response i was given and that i shouldgo to the towel hut on the beach i explained that iwent there and it was not open , and was told that ihad to wait until it opened the bus for the excursionwas scheduled to leave , so we left with no towels theposted times on the towel hut stated that it opened at8am and at 8am it was not open on another day theexcursion tour to santo domingo was scheduled to leaveat 6:45am the buffets did not open until 7:00am after arriving in the lobby at 6:30am i asked aboutfood and what those who were scheduled to leave at6:45am should do ( the trip was approximately 3 1/2hours drive to santo domingo ) and was told that thebuffet did not open until 7:00am and that i had towait after further discussion another tourist foundout from talking to another person that food forexcursions could be ordered 2 days before it would bein the format of a boxed lunch no one had given usthis information and no one was willing to provide uswith any food of note the buffet was set up andready for service , but they would not make anyexception for any of us there were many of us whowere not informed of the service or how to order foodand no accommodations were going to be made we weredriven to santo domingo on an empty stomach i attempted to contact the agency with whom we booked our tour through several times from my room and was disconnected or placed on hold for several minutes i finally left a message on the voice mail and expressed my desperate plea for help the next day when i did reach someone , i was told that the number that i had given for a return call ( the number on the phonein the hotel ) was invalid i was told that there wasa message left for me at the front desk - - there was nomessage at the front desk and or on the phone iagain tried to call the travel agency from my room and thephone call was again dropped i went to the frontlobby and asked to use the lobby desk phone and wasdenied i spoke with a man named angel who wasacting manager for the day and after hearing all mygrievances , stated this is not the united states , wecant do anything for you and you wont get what youwant another man behind the desk by the name ofalex stated i cant help you , i hate this place , itsucks and i 'm leaving upon arrival it was explained to me that therewere several restaurants and a buffet to eat at iattempted to make reservations ( which had to be made 2days in advance ) and was told that not all restaurantswere open each night at first we were told that allthe seats for one night was full , but after muchdiscussion , we were reluctantly given a table gettingfood was a battle information related to makingreservations for dining was not presented at the timeof check in i attempted to speak with a manager several timesand was always told that he was unavailable therewas a card in the hotel room on the nightstand with amessage and contact number from the manager i attempted to call this number and asked for this man at the lobby , and no one ever knew where he was instead i was forced to talk withpeople named leo , brigida , and martha ( martha wasapparently involved in public relations ) all who sentme in circles repeating my problems , directing me tovarious other people and spending hours in the lobbywith absolutely no assistance , no compassion and noresolutions in short , do yourself a favor , stay somewhere else and give yourself a chance to truly enjoy punta cana 
not worth it we stayed at grand occidental in punta cana for a week and we were not impressed the beach was cleaned and the food was good as long as you ate at the buffet , pizza or taqueria drinks were decent and good service at the bar the check in was horrible no customer service skills when we got there , the line was long and one clerk available to help while tourist waited patiently in line , people were coming up to the front complaining about the room we were told that they did not have a key for the safe box and our room was not available even though it was 6:30 p when we finally got our room , we had one bed when we had booked a junior suite and the clerk reported that he did not have any junior suites at that hotel and blamed the travel agency sales people hunted us all over and different prices were given to different foreigners we finally got key for the safe box two days later and were over charged we asked to speak to a supervisor and he was never available we do not recommend this resort to anybody there are better places where you are the customer and your dollar is worth every penny 
please do not stay in this hotel the facilities are not bad the service is terrible specially for those paying with us dollars europeans have a different treatment the food is horrible and boring they repeat the same menu day after day if what you have in mind is to have a taste of dominican food you may forget it turkey and mashed potatoes with some mediocre sauces is all what you are going to see the restaurants are awful and it 's a hassle to make a reservation in any of them lobster is not included , you have to pay 35 dollars per person to eat one lobster , and shrimps are not even known there on the other hand , there is a constant harrassment everywhere you go if you walk through the lobby , some hotel staff people would try to sell you a package for next time , and no matter how strict you are in telling them you are not interested , they will keep bugging you until the moment you are finally and happily getting the heck out of there if you go to the beach , the entertainment staff wo not leave alone not even for a minute , they want you to dance , to play games , there is not peace in that place if you try to walk somehwere else you will run into someone else trying to sell you something i had a horrible experience i saw people as sad and disappointed as i was i really discourage any of you to visit this hotel if you have a family keep in mind this is a topless pool - beach hotel 
more like torture not a vacation this was the worst vacation of my life the weather was cloudy all week take away the beach and the pool there was absolutely nothing to do any water activity i wanted to do was always cancelled due to rain i was bored out of my mind i managed to go snorkeling one day and that was actually cool that was the extent i am from new york so i am spoiled with good food at home the food at this hotel is absolutely gross i tried everything and nothing was good i had to go to the supermarket and get chips and crackers to survive the week i also had to leave the resort to go to the supermarket because the one that the resort provided was ridiculously overpriced a bag of sun chips was $6 that is more than three times the amount i pay in new york and new york?? prices should be higher than a third world country?? prices the shows at nighttime are basically the same every night it is always people from the audience doing a dance on stage the entertainment was lacking i mean if you want to go away and be bored out of your mind this is the place for you i am 23 years old and my boyfriend who came with me is 29 we did drink a lot but after a while of just drinking you do start to get stomach aches i went to the club one night and stayed to midnight waiting for it to get good but we were the only ones in the place ( besides the security guards ) the staffs at the bars were the nicest the rest of the staff was really nasty to americans they try to take advantage of you every chance they get and i was tipping like crazy the rooms were ok minus the ant infestation and the power/water constantly shutting on and off there is also no water pressure in the showers if you have this place booked , i would cancel that was the worst spent $2400 of our life since the second day i was there i could not wait to be home i never ever felt that way on vacation before if you have no choice and have to go , i would pack snacks to eat 
would never go back my girlfriends and i had the misfortune of staying at the occidental resort over the memorial day weekend first off , check - in was a nightmare it was completely unorganized and the lines were ridiculous we get to our room which looked like it had not been thoroughly cleaned in a year , the bathroom was disgusting not to mention the brown water coming from both the sink and the shower oh and let me not forget the toilet which flushed when it wanted to we were subjected to 3 blackouts and for 2 days there was no running water for hours the food was mediocre but the staff was very nice the best thing about the resort was the beach and of course the drinks do not get me wrong i will usually make the best out of a bad situation but this experience is by far the worst i 've ever had i would not recommend this resort to my worst enemy 
would never recommend my friend and i went down for a relaxing , fun trip to the dominican during memorial day weekend we were never told it was urban experience weekend and unfortunately had to listen to horrible rap music from 11 a with no breaks or any other type of music we called to be moved and to see when the music would stop ( we called mid afternoon ) they told us soon and that we could not be moved the next day ( friday ) we decided to go to the beach to avoid whatever could happen with this urban experience weekend it was great for a little bit , then they started blaring more rap music closer to the beach ( and at another pool we tried to relax at ) parasailing was fun , though the driver of the boat kept us above the sand the whole time instead of over the water nothing seemed organized with planning the parasailing trip had to wait a long time we were constantly asked by workers if we wanted to try this and that , and we kept on saying no the buffett was horrible , but you ca not expect much at a buffett the italian restaurant was delicious , as was the grill mexican was iffy and we did not try the oriental the drinks were nothing fabulous , but they were available whenever we wanted them the resort lost power twice and the water was shut off for a couple hours one day there was a leak in the closet of our room and it unfortunately soaked my friend 's clothes and stained one item we called the front desk 3 times to complain and see if someone could come and check out the leak no one came after an hour of waiting and calling we finally brought the clothes to the desk , where they told us the manager is not around , he 's probably eating they told us to talk to someone else and that person brought the clothes to someone else and then came back and said all we can do is give you free laundry service and move you to another room this was the early evening the day before we were leaving so there was no point in moving we should have been reimbursed for the ruined shirt and they could have at least come to the room to check out the damage the rest of the time our room was musty and gross and we also killed three cockroach looking bugs in one night and we have bed bug bits all over our legs we never felt clean in our room or after we showered i do not recommend this trip to anyone who has traveled to fancier places and is used to good service 
loved the grounds , thats about it problem with the water in the bathrooms it was brown one day there was no water there was no premium or even top shelf alcohol getting extra towels for your room was like pulling teeth you can only make reservations for restaurants in the morning ( 'til 10am ) then you have no choice on the food they serve they dont tell you that its a fixed menu ( for most ) stick with the buffet the best part was the lobster house which you have to pay per person the price was great for the amount of food the grounds  the rooms were kept neat and clean 
we were one of the couples that read lots of review but figured we were open minded and easy going people not everyone has the same opinion boy we were wrong where do i start we got back today so still drained from the over all experience we would reccommend apple anytime they were great no problem at all with the flight , ride to and from airport this was our first all inclusive vacation so we stayed in the royal club in the occidental and if it was not for the royal club and the beach we would have thought what are we paying for after we arrived and things started to happen we figured lets suck it up because after all we 're on vacation the staff at the royal cub restaurant were fantastic and to work 12 days ( the staff ) straight all day and be as nice as they were was amazing to us i ( the husband ) went back tonight to read more review and i have to tell you everything i read tonight and before our trip is exactly what happens it was bad 2 times no water at all , electric went out , tiolet ran 24 hours straight all the time , room keys never worked , below average room and out dated bathroom , ac was very loud , the water issue was not bad when we had it , noise from the contruction going on , oh and they never told us when the water was off , never informed us that the private pool in the royal club was not even working as in no water in it , we did experience the feeling that if you do not have royal club bracelets on you were looked down on if you are royal club you have different brands of alcohol room service was very nice we would not reccomend occidental punta cana to anyone and would never go back still have not decided if we will return to punta cana 
do not go our group of 7 just got back from the occidental in punta cana we had stayed in dr before ( not occidental ) and had a great time all were looking forward to a fun trip arrived on the 24th of april , to find 2 rooms were ready and 2 were not 1 of our friends room reservation was lost after they sat for an hour or more in the lobby they were finally shown to their rooms my husband and i had a problem with our room key it did not work so i called up to reception and asked for a new key to be brought to us they informed me that i needed to come up myself to get new key off i go , get new key , back to room and it still does not work this went on for 4 more attempts 2 hours later , yeah the keys work , until the next day when they did not one of our friends went to take a shower , no hot water , she sucked it up , got in and quickly found out that the water was to stop running completely we had rain one evening , the resort was under about 6 of water , while we waded through to get to the buffet , this terrible stench of sewer was all around us if you do not mind drinking only dominican beer , then you 'll be ok but if you want a bud , it will cost you $5 but only after 5:00 pm , when they unlock the beer safe are you kidding me the list keeps going on do yourself a favor if you 've booked this resort , change it and if you have not do not there are to many other good ones , to choice from if they ever once tried to make things right , you 'd be able to over look some problems , but they did not customer satisfaction is key in my book , something they hav not learned yet 
piece of crap hotel food was awful , often edible due to the way it was ( or was not ) cooked at las reses we left in the middle of dinner service at all restaurants was slow and poor we even had to get up from a table to go to a bar and get drinks ourselves because we were told they were out of coke and ice tea ( both available at the bar just downstairs from the restaurant ) cold water dipped from the ceiling onto us as we showered house keeping was in and out of our room 3-4 times a day , one afternoon we came back from the beach to find our suitcases moved , our mattress up against the wall , and a man sitting in the middle of the floor putting together a bed frame we were never told this would be happening or that the other construction would take place in our room coming back another day , our door was wide open with no one inside sheetrock and plaster lay on the floor by the sliding glass door a couple minutes later , three men came in and said they just put up trim boards and asked if they should clean up the mess about an hour later a maid came add to that a phone that didn?? ring ( luckily we were awake before our wakeup call ) and watching from the patio as a maid fixed the blankets on the bed without changing the sheets ( how many times without us watching did that happen 
we returned from punta cana on jan 24/08 and could not have asked for a much better vacation the resort was beautiful - well groomed and very clean the people were very friendly and warm the food was well varied and readily available and the rum was delicious - yum our room was in a building fairly close to the beach , was always well kept and spacious ( a junior suite ) although we did have a slight problem with some leakage during a rainstorm - nothing serious that in any way inconvienienced us - just some leakage that ran down the wall from an a/c vent the beach was unbelievable we talked with some other people who were staying at a much more expensive resort and they could only complain about their beach because although it extended the full length of their resort - it was only about 6' wide our beach was huge probably about 40' wide and 300' long with plenty of chairs for everybody the night life could use some work though - we saw a few shows and i must say the michael jackson impersonation was sensational and very well done i think you maybe needed a special appreciation for the other shows as they were mostly interpretive dance other than that and a small casino there was really very little to do at night on two occassions the resort allowed vendors to set up tables in the courtyard to pedal their wares this was nice as they did not seem quite as aggressive as they were if you walked down the beach to their huts - and the stuff for sale is all the same i have to say i was surprised at how horribly expensive things were in the stores ( where you could not barter ) i needed a couple of essentials like body lotion , more sunscreen and hair conditioner ( nothing designer - very plain jane ) , and for the smallest quantities available the bill came to $43 us so be sure to bring enough so you do not run out if i could offer a few tips i would say to 1) request a room on the second floor as i can see where the planked roofing would pose a leakage problem 2) ensure you bring enough of the basics 3) ask for rum in your tropical drinks - if you do not , they assume you want a virgin drink and if you do they are very generous with the booze 4) tip appropriately - these people live on tips - bartenders make $1/hr only 5) do not only tip your maid , but bring some stickers , coloring books and crayons etc for their children - these girls work 16hrs/day and their hubbies bring the kids in to be able to see their moms ' , and with the wages they make you can bet their kids get nothing like this all in all this hotel is very good value for your money and i would be very happy to return again - this time with my children , although i 'm sure my 13yr old would walk around with his jaw dropped most of the time due to all the topless sunbathing one other thing of note is the room safes - they are not broken you need to purchase the actual lock that fits in the hole we did not bother with this and had no problem at all the vacation reps will tell you that there has never been a theft at this hotel so do not worry about the negative reviews unless you 're someone who expects absolute luxury but if you are average middle - class person you will find this resort to be much more than just adequate tami of edmonton 
a stranded 3star cruiseship my friend and i have just spent a week in this resort what a dissapointing place , unless you like being in the middle of nowhere , being treated like retards , karioke in the lobby , ballroom lessons , watered down drinks , wine from another planet and appaling food and unless you spend a fortune on various outings , you`ll have no idea what country you`re in no chance of just popping out to sample local life or enjoying different bars and restaurants we also learned that many hotels in dom rep deliberately doublebook as to ensure full hotels , so if you`re last in the queue ( which happened to us ) they will relocate you to a different hotel in our case they had overbooked by 20 rooms never trust their timing , they have no idea of time we were told our new hotel were just 5 mins up the road , at the reception they said at least 20 mins the cabdriver said 45 mins it took 55 mins on a most hazardous road staff were friendly overall , but lacking in english whatever your request , - being an extra chair on the balcony or where is so and so standard reply was : would you like water with thatthe maidservice was also back to front we were told if you left a few dollars in the room , service would be more than excellent service was not that bad so we didnt tip at first , on day 3 we left some money , and the room then had no towels same thing the following day , no water or soda in the fridge we stopped tipping of course and things were fine the beachtowel system was a joke , basically bring your own the a la carte restaurant booking system was another hazzle don`t bother , the food was worse than the buffet , especially the oriental we never saw snacks of any kind , and the afternoon tea were some leftover cakes from lunch , with tea and coffee from a machine , self served in the lobby on paperservietes and paper cups the only redeeming aspect was the stunning beach and luckily the good weather 
we heard nothing but good things that was the only good thing we get there and the swim up pool was closed there was no warning about this happening the next day we try to go on an excursion , well the car broke down , we get a taxi which gets lost and we miss the excursion 2 days before we leave the power goes out throughout the hotel which means no plumbing that was out the entire day/night they did not comp anything which tells me they could care less there were annoying people trying to sell you crap that you do not want i got so sick from the food that i missed the last day there i 've been to a lot of places but this is one that i do not suggest to anyone for them to not let us know the main swim up pool was closed was a shock the shows at night there got worse everynight all i have to say is , do not say i did not warn you 
don , t go arrived on 29th oct 2007 stayed until 7th nov could 'nt stand it anymore so we paid extra and went to the majestic what a fantastic hotel and what a difference day we arrived at the occidental the pool was being drained asked the reps but no - one seemed to know anything about it , within 2 days there were about 40 if not more locals hammering away at the render from dawn till dusk , also the two apartment blocks either side of the childrens pool were being renovated as well so if you sat there you had to put up with builders ogling you , whistling and saying god knows what in spanish timeshare reps were constantly harrassing us and even tried to sell my son in law drugs the food was 'nt great there were six in our party and four of us got sick i have travelled all over and stayed in many different types of hotels , and if it was 'nt for the building work and the reps it would have been fine , but do not go until they have it sorted i never relaxed until we moved hotels 
" do yourself a favor and just stop reading all the reviews and pick another hotel dirty , smelly , no hot water , more timeshare salespersons than maintenance staff , ash tray for a beach i met my brother here for a quick trip we were meeting at the hotel since we came in on different flights when i checked in i asked the gentleman if my brother had checked in yet they did not understand when i asked again he looked perplexed i asked that he make sure we have two separate beds since i was rooming with my brother the man just gave me a big wink and nod and said no problem insinuating that i was a married woman ( i am ) meeting my boyfriend ( he gave us a king bed ) i asked for a safe ( you have to ask for and pay for it ) and the man seemed insulted and asked why i wanted that i informed him that i actually read any waivers that i sign , including the long , small print one they gave me at check in , and that since i signed that i would not hold the hotel liable for anything stolen from my room i would be needing a safe he gave me a key safe give me a break our room had a septic odor that would come and go , one night it was so bad it woke both of us up we never had hot water in the room , neither did the rest of our building (10) from what we heard from the other friends we traveled with the beach is one giant ash tray with cigarette butts everywhere such a shame because it really is beautiful the fruit was excellent , very fresh and ripe the rest was fine the entire resort is filled with nuisances you have to make reservations for any of the specialty restaurants ( not a big deal ) but you cannot call in for them , you have to go to the special reservation desk ( and pray someone is there ) timeshare sales persons galore constant badgering to take photos with the monkey , parrots etc ( they want you to buy them in the photo area ) i was dragged out of my beach chair to take pics on multiple occasions there are no defined topless areas i saw saggy ones everywhere ( even the buffet line at lunch ) the only place to get a beach towel is at the one far end of the beach ( near all the tour service booths ) my brother and i were pressured to take scuba lessons and get our padi certificate in one afternoon ( how does that work ) and dive the same day we explained we were leaving the next day and she still pushed us to sign up we said we would get back to her , later we ran into a friend that is certified and he told us that you cannot fly within 24hr of a dive due to the nitrogen clearly the dive center was only worried about making money and not our well being overall i firmly believe that punta cana was put together as one big tourist trap , there is nothing authentic about it and there is nothing around to do to get the feel for the local culture/history punta cana is a good place for spring breakers or people who only want to lie on the beach 
stolen suitcase in just 15 minutes upon arriving at the occidental grand flamenco on friday , july 13 and less than 15 minutes later , one of my two baggage , which contained about 3000 00 $ in belongings of my wife and mine , got lost after two hours of waiting , a lady that posed as the manager ( we later found out she wasn?? ) informed us that the hotel personnel could not locate the suitcase i asked to call the police but the fake manager saystold us that if i want to speak to the police ?? should go to my room and mark the zero? to call them myself at that moment we realized we had made a very bad decision booking this hotel despite the situation , we decided to give the hotel personnel an opportunity to find our suitcase on saturday , july 14, one of the hotel employee took us to the ??ogo shop to get some clothes later that day , the security personnel indicated me that there were ??ossibilities? my suitcase was in the airport , but the next day mr brea ( the security manager ) indicated me that the suitcase was not in the airport i ask to call the police once again , and i was told by mr brea that the police is not going to come to the hotel in short , i ended up going to the police with mr brea and other hotel personnel , the trip was at least 40 minutes in every direction on monday , the 16th of july , i finally get to talk to the hotel general manager , mr puente which very kindly agrees to return me the money of my stay , invites me to a weekend back to the hotel and gives me access to the royal club also he assures me that my claim for the lost suitcase will be submitted to the hotel 's insurance later that day i returned to the airport to verify if my suitcase is there at mr puente 's request surprisingly my suitcase was in the airport after my suitcase appears and back to the hotel i received a call from mr puente , in which he exempts the hotel of any fault , he indicates me that the personnel of the american airlines assured him that the suitcase never left the airport and proceeds to ask me back for the clothes that the hotel had bought for my wife and for me on tuesday , the 17th of july , after returning the clothes the hotel ??urchased? me and my wife , i received a message of which mr brea stating that there were two t - shirts missing in the bundle that i returned of course after all this ordeal and having one day left on our vacations , i was very upset and i replied to mr brea though one of the assistants , that this was our last day in the hotel and that i was not going lose one more time looking for two shirts , if this matter was so important , that he can let me know to give him the number of my credit card so he can charge them brea leaves a message where he says that i can forget about the matter on thursday , the 19th of july , before leaving punta cana , i stopped in the offices of aa and find out though one of the managers , that the suitcase was entered in the computer two day after my arrival and that there were no claims for a lost suitcase in other words the accusations of mr puente were unfounded because i did not take the wrong suitcase from the airport otherwise someone would have claimed as lost i supposed that somebody from the hotel took my suitcase load it in another taxi and my suitcase ended up in the airport as you can see the service in this hotel is probably the worse i have seen , people are not trained to handle situations like the one we went through and in order to make themselves look good , they will place the blame of their lack of professionalism on you in addition to this is worth saying that our room leaked every time it rained , the bathroom door did not close , the power would go out everyday and the air conditioner was inexistent we booked through american express travel , which misrepresent this hotel as a 4 star if you value your time off and your money , book somewhere else this is not a 4 star hotel and needless to say you wont be given a 4 star treatment , probably not even a 2 
horrible rooms - please go to another resort well folks we went there aug 23 to sept 1, 2007, i am writing here in shame that i did not listen to the previous reviews regarding this resort the staff is non existent for non spanish speaking people i have seen 4 rooms in 3 different buildings and they were the same so this is not based just on one sample other friends in building 10 did not have hot water for 4 days anyway we felt like slumming here and if it was not for the spectacular beach we would have called this our worst vacation also , royal club upgrade is not worth it pros : - beach is awesome ( luckily that was the reason we went there ) - weather is awesome with nice breeze coming from the ocean - shows were alright although i could tell some people were not excited of being made fools of on stage pools look ok although i cannot see why many people were there , perhaps they had kids cons : - rooms are terrible , beds do not even have a headboard so your head is against plaster - rooms have no lightning and are really dim , i felt like i was at grandmas in the village during the communist era bed covers were pretty gross bathrooms are in dire need of upgrade - shower head was so clogged that it only have about 4 streams going ( i spent 30 min with a needle trying to make it better ) - staff at the front desk is non - existent if you have any issues ( you will not realize how frustrating this is until you 're there , i have heard many fallouts from visitors with the staff while cruising through the lobby at times ) - food at the buffet is not great although you will find something to eat , pork chops and ham does not cut it for us restaurants do not provide good service and a lot of people i saw left to go to buffet after 45 min wait for a waiter - snack bars serve raw hamburgers and really bad friespeople that rate this hotel great must not be from countries like usa or canada or they may have not stayed at too many hotels in those countries in their lifetime we are a couple is our late twenties and have been to the caribbean before so we know that 4 stars do not mean anything there but this is lower than 2 if you can i afford it , i heard from some folks on the beach while chatting with them that bahia principe is really nice 
disaster the only thing i have to say about this hotel is disaster the service is horrible on the third day , my girlfriend and i got bitten about 40 times on each leg we have no idea if it was beg bugs or sand flees afterwards , we changed rooms , which had no air conditioning , no shower pressure and a blocked toilet also , we called one morning for a wake up call , which we never got and also we called for a bellboy to get our luggage to change room , which once again never came we also went to see the doctor , which did not speak much english and did not want to help us because we did not dish out 180$ for an examination the reason why we did not want to pay the money was because the hotel was responsible for the situation we were in i can go on and on about what a confusing and unorganized trip 
worst vacation ever there is nothing grand about the occidental grand flamenco punta cana if you are an american contractor you could come to this resort and make a fortune because the entire place needs to be gutted and renovated please take said everything here seriously , i wish i had done more homework and not gone on the advice of my travel agent from the moment you arrive things are bad there is no welcome party or drinks the check in dates back to the stone age prepare to wait while staff go back and forth to the room there is no such thing as modern amenities the check in desk has one computer and any requests will go unfulfilled unless you are prepare to raise the roof ( ie $#* ) $ ) the food is horrible you never get any wash cloths i had to use my key to rip the towels to make wash cloths my room was musty and there was condensation on my floor i was eventually moved after i went to the lobby at 11pm in my pajamas ( i hit the sack early because there is little entertainment on site and what is available sucks ) and demanded to speak to a manager my previous calls to guest services ended in someone hanging the phone up on me we were moved to a room that was a home for mosquitoes the beach is okay at best do not look for shopping because there is nothing worth buying ( i guess this is a plus after you have spent much money on a horrible vacation no need to continue to fuel their economy ) the drinks are not worth putting in your body the hotel was overbooked so the management was offering a 7 night return stay free if you would leave for a couple of days and visit another of their hotels after looking online these hotels are no better than the occidental a chain of horrible hotels please do not think that i am just another spoiled american who goes to third world country and expects too much i have been to other third world countries and the experience was nothing like this if it is a vacation you are after dont do it here u have been forewarned , dont want to say i told u so 
in hospital for three out of seven days trust me do not go my husband and i were just married on july 7th of this year and went to punta cana for our honeymoon , we stayed at the occidental grand punta cana , what a nightmare from start to finish we were supposed to have the honeymoon package/upgrade but that never happened , put that aside we spent three days in the hospital due to eating on the resort what a great honeymoon the hospital had better service and food then the resort , i would not let a dog eat there hardly anyone speaks english and if they do it 's broken at best our beautiful upgraded room had ants in the bathroom , the tub would not drain and did i mention the night the power went out for about two hours trust me i have been to several different resorts , and have never had any type of issue with food or services please think long and hard before booking this resort it may look nice in the pictures but be careful we were not the only ones to become sick that week book at own risk 
the most horrible 24 hours of my life this has been my first and last trip to the dominican republic we arrived at the airport , and were very vaguely pointed in the direction of the bus that would take us to the hotel we waited at least 20-30 min for the bus to leave the driver was horrible , and actually hit a palm tree when trying to back out of a small space by one of the other resorts we finally arrived at the hotel only to wait in a check in line for 30 min not even the beginning of the issues we were told to come back at 3pm , almost an hour later we got a pina colada at the bar , which contained little if no alcohol , and sat on stained seats in the un - airconditioned lobby while waiting at 10 to 3pm , we got on line perhaps 5 people were in front of us we waited a total of nearly 3 hours to get a room numerous people cut in front of us , many were served only because they spoke spanish staff was actually laughing at our desperation , apparently finding their poor accomadations amusing we were told to come back in 15 min , but us along with other guests were demanding rooms right away eventually , we were given a room and headed to the bellboy to tell him the room number , but to please wait because we had to wait on another line for a room safe after another 15 min , and a couple attempting to cut in front of us that we prevented , we got the safe key and headed outside to let the bell boy know we were ready for him to bring the luggage to our horror , our luggage had disappeared we ran to our room , and of course it was not there we attempted to ask a maid for help , but she spoke no english , and really had no idea what was going on eventually we found the bell boy , who had moved the luggage without permission , and ripped our bags off the cart and took them to our rooms ourselves but even more fun was yet to come we asked for 2 double beds , and instead got one king size the toilet was leaking , the floor had mold in between the tiles , the bathtub had black/grey colored dirt on the floor , there were stains of human origin on our blanket , and bugs on the fruit basket and comfortor water was undrinkable , and for 4 stars , should surely have been purified instead , we were forced to lug water bottles back to our room the beach was less than spectacular tons of seaweed and cloudy water pool was no better , it closes at 7pm and was cloudy also we had nothing to do the entire night most bars close between 5pm - 7pm , the lastest is 1am if you 're hungry after the buffet closes at 10:30pm , too bad you 're eating nothing the food at the buffet was actually very decent , and was about the only thing we enjoyed , however tiny bugs were on the table cloth and had to be killed during the meal until after 9pm , all of our drinks were served in very small plastic cups this is 4 star service the only beer available was presidente , which we both dislike the staff is rude , unfriendly , and barely acknowledge you 're presence do not ask any questions , b/c they probably wo not be answering you or you may be waiting hours until they do nightlife is non existent entertainment consists of a jennifer lopez impersonator singing poorly , and the rest is in spanish the whole thing reminded me of a retirement village as two young women in our early 20's , we found literally nobody our age in the entire complex mostly couples with young children not what we expected at all , and completely undesirable after much deliberation , we decided the trip was so doomed and miserable at this hell hole that we contacted our travel agent and booked a flight out of there the very next day the manager offered us a new room after we complained the following morning , while sending maids to tend to our room to our horror , upon arriving back to our room to pick up our luggage a few minutes later , i found important paperwork i had left out thrown away ( i had not expected anyone in my room or throwing anything away that was not clearly in the garbage ) , and the same filthy blankets were left on our bed we had not slept in it the night before ( we were reduced to sleeping on straw chairs rather then face the squalor of the beds or any bugs that may have been in it ) but goes to show you how often things are changed same stains in the same spot only one person out of the entire staff was polite and helpful , and arranged for a taxi to take us back to the airport ( we were unable to take the bus that we had paid for in the all inclusive package being that it stops at at least 5 other hotels and we would have missed our flight ) if you do not mind squalor , appaling customer service , rude staff , bug infested rooms , and being unable to shower your entire stay , then this is absolutely the choice for you this is truly hell on earth 
vacation from hell this had to be the worst vacation  resort i have ever experienced mind you , i travel to the dominican republic yearly mostly to santo domingo which i would highly recommend if you are looking for some fun , relaxation  mostly a cheap vacation especially great customer service this will be my first an last trip to punta cana punta cana is very pricey occidental was by far the worst resort in the dominican republic customer service was horrible food was ok pool was disgusting beach was nice be prepare to reserve for a beach chair every morning night life , boring casino was a joke mangu nightclub was ok beware of the second floor unless you are interested in being in a strip club i would not recommend young couples to this resort please believe all the negative reviews they are all true 
hell on earth are you serious these other reviews are very very very misleading i thought i was just being picky about having no washclothes , no water bottles in the room , and no clean sheets however , when speaking to several other guests , i found they has the same problems when you get there , they do not offer you any beverages , tell you about dinners , or really even greet you once you get to the front desk , they take about an hour to check you in because they are sooo slow there also , other people cut in front of you because they wait too long as well then , everyone wants a dollar from you on top of all that our room was smelly , had bugs in the beds , had two fulls ( pushed together ) instead of a king , bathroom was so gross we wore our flip - flops in the showers dont stay here if you are going to be cheap about vacation , go to mexico if you want to spend more money , go to a bavaro 
nasty hotel worse ever totaly to be avoided this hotel has realy bad maintance issues and needs to be pulled downand re - built , i had the worse holiday of my life and i am well traveled where to start well i was in block 16 room 202 and at first the puddles of water in the bathroom we actualy thought it was the toilet leaking and then it rained the entire roof of the bathroom pour in rain water which went all over the electric wires ofthe aircon the aircon then broke down as the room contined to flood they called out maintance who took down the false ceiling to fix it and showed me the extent of the problem and just shook there heads the leaks were not fixed and it had been going on some time the hotel could not move us to another room as it was at max occupancy it rains in the caribean alot but this hotel is not geared to cope with it , power outages make the water sytem break down i e no electicno flushing toilets , the rain water floods the paths so deep you can not get up to the resturants in the everning wearing anything on yourfeet the rain water was all swept into the swiming pool and then theswimming pool went green and was closed down i went all inclusive and there is no choice of beer , just week lager , there is a diferent colour wrist band system and pecking order in the hotel wrong colourband and you dont even get served at the bars for hours most hotels in the caribean go to great lengths to keep hawkers away but not this hotel it invites them in and has its own team of hawkers in the lobby pestering you to join travel clubs etc , most annoying and persistant the ala carte resturants are rubbish and have no choice available it is a set menu , we tryed three of them and did not botheragain in our second week the beech was naff and was as busy as oxford steet on a saterday afternoon , to get a sunbed you had to be up at 6am and reserve one with a towel and the same for a decent spotaround the pool the staff were totaly unhelpfull unless you tip them there are alot of hotels at this resort and i totaly recomend you chose a different one to this untill they get there maintance isssus fixed ( i e nock it down and re - build it ) even the front lobby bar roof leaked , we saw plenty poeple slipping over and hurting themselves on wet floors the disco is nasty and lets in the locals from outside dont go there 
very bad experience please allow me to describe our experience at the occidental grand flamenco in punta cana , bavaro domenican republic we travelled march 24th 2007 from toronto we assumed this resort was a luxurious executive getaway as it turned out , it was not cheap to stay there ( over $5,000 cdn ) , but it was our worst ever holiday experience we arrived there on saturday march 24th 2007 at approximately 9:45 in the evening although the resort was only about 30 minutes from the airport , we had to wait there for other passengers , drop them off at their resort (5 stops ) in our humble opinion a 4+ - star resort should have a passenger shuttle that offers direct service and at the very least a soft drink or a bottle of water while we waited 20 minutes to depart the airport - none of these services were offered by the occidental grand flamenco after driving all the vacationers to their resorts , we finally got to the occidental grand we were not greeted with any drinks as expected from a 4+ resort and wasted another 45 minutes arguing with the person at the premium service desk because our rooms were all messed up we had specifically asked for 2 rooms next to each other and not 2 rooms in separate buildings as i have a 10 year old and a 16 year old my friends who traveled with us had the same issue and were forced to sleep in our second room ( which was temporary to be for one night only ) the stress caused in the first two hours alone put a huge dent in our first impression of the resort and in our enjoyment of our vacation the row of our disappointments do not end here , there is plenty more : we paid for ??remium club package ? we were given building 12 room 12110, 12109 which are not transat premium club rooms we had no fruit baskets in the rooms , no bathrobes , slippers and beach towels and no rum or alcohol in the mini bar we were hungry and needed to eat but the restaurant buffet was closed we ended up spending the rest of our evening waiting for pizza  taco?? located up on the balcony next to the italian restaurant we finally got our food after waiting in line for 35 minutes the second day of our stay at the occidental resort started out by not having any electrical or water service this prevented us from taking a shower , brushing our teeth , washing our hands and flushing the toilet what a terrible experience for civilized people with high hygiene standards i went and hunted down felix who , by now , had plenty of notes concerning complaints from the resort guests i told him about the water problem ( or the lack thereof ) , and he told me that the resort has some problems with the electricity , and that ( according to what he knows from the resort staff ) , the electricity and water service should return shortly felix also asked us to come back at 3:00 pm to change our rooms the power did not come back on until after 9:00 that evening note : still no premium service that we paid for the breakfast of our second day had a pleasant surprise : they served fresh fruit this was about the only type of food i enjoyed so far but , not to get carried away with too much pleasure , they ran out of bananas i tried to ask the restaurant staff for more bananas , but they either did not understand or they were too lazy to get some , or had none i put some more effort into my sign language by trying to show them the color and the substance of the material , and succeeded after about 5 painstaking minutes : they presented me with 4 rotten smelly bananas? covered in onion peal i can only imagine where they got them from at this time i had a chance to speak with a spanish speaking guest from spain who was able to tell me ( in great english ) that in her experience the guests must beg the staff for anything that would normally be served as a standard at any other vacation resort she ( along with us ) was quite annoyed to say the least on our third day , we went to see felix about our premium suite and he advised that the best he can do is offer us 2 rooms in building 24 but they are far apart this didn?? work for us as we didn?? trust our two children sleeping down the hall on their own felix said that he could send the towels , robes and everything offered in those rooms to our room in building 12 since we were only staying for one week we had no choice but to accept as the last thing i wanted was to spend my entire vacation in the lobby arguing with him that afternoon we found the towels , robes etc on our bed the power went out again for half the day and the toilets and water service did not work the rain flooded the walk ways and hallway leading to our room water was seeping in from under our door from all the water my wife slipped and fell on the wet stone tiles - it proved to be very slippery when wet i went to the reception and i spoke to the reception desk i told him about the water and he said that there is nothing he can do about the flooding that evening , we all got sick and spent most of the day on the toilets my 16 year old son was vomiting all night and had fever my 10 year old son also became very ill with stomach problems on our fourth day , we had no clean towels , no clean slippers and the mini bar was not stocked ( is this the premium package ) the power went out again for at least 5 hours we went to have dinner at 7pm to the only available restaurant the table cloths were dirty and stained , some of the cutleries had remainders on them from previous meals , and there was no serviette on the tables in fact there was nothing on the tables except a salt and pepper shaker we had to get everything from the middle of the restaurant they had cheap napkins though , it was better than nothing at this time the only thing that made us feel some comfort was that we were going home soon but , back to reality , we found out that the only four cooked meals were not heated by any means from below ( at the buffet tables ) which means that within a mere 30 minutes everything became cold when a pan got empty , nothing was replaced by the kitchen staff because they had no power by thursday evening our suite reeked from the stink that the un - sanitized toilet caused this is totally absurd and very un - healthy situation that we had to clean up and we have paid a considerably large amount of money for this which we normally would not do even if it were our job - unless we were getting paid a very large amount of money for it the smell of the toilets was unbearable how do they expect us to sleep in our suite like this we also earlier found out that the 2 rooms that my friends had in building 23 were given away to someone else we used those rooms during the day as it was closer to the beach the supervisor explained that the maids always found the rooms clean so they assumed that they were vacant? here is the best part they checked my friends out of the hotel they didn?? exist in the resort anymore and the only reason we found out was because their family back home called to speak to them and couldn?? find them on friday , my 10 year old son became very ill and needed medical attention which cost me $168 us we spent the entire day in our dirty room we asked felix to arrange a taxi for us to go to the airport earlier and to my surprise they did we couldn?? wait to leave as we were all very sick my son was vomiting in the airport and starting shaking from the lack of hydration in his body we saved for an entire year for this trip and came back more stressed out than when we left home i cannot believe we had to experience this as a family vacation 
worst vacation ever - caribbean traveler from wisconsin for the last 15 years i 've vacationed in cancun at first , followed by playa del carmen , mx because mexico has become so expensive , we decided to try punta cana from march 23-30, 2007 i agree with the previous comments about how bad it was the weather ca not be helped , but during the 7 days we had frequent downpours and the hotel is laid out with no connecting buildings , so you have to run through mid - calf deep puddles to get to the restaurants , bars , lobby , etc we had a 12 hour power outage the beginning of the week , which meant no water or toilets and their sewage system leaves a lot to be desired even on a good day it also affected meals there were power outages almost every day , sometimes during the night and the rude front desk staff attributed it to maintenance and kept giving false information about when there would be power many of the rooms , even the 1st floor , were flooded with all inclusive i 'm accustomed to poolside and beach service , but there was none you had to take care of yourself the pool was not the usual aqua blue that i was used to either , so i did not go in the beach towel area did not open till 8 am , but there were always towels on the lounges by 6 am , even though we were told we had to turn them in every night by 6 pm there was also no room service , which we 've always had before our room towels were collected at times in the am and we were left with no towels until late afternoon one writer said the hotel caters to europeans and i could not agree more the color of your wristband seemed to designate your service , which was horrible we only found 1 waiter in the buffet and maybe 2 bartenders who were fun and pleasant we had other people tell us the same thing we felt - that the staff seems miserable and it 's very apparent these people are nothing like the people in playa del carmen we were never treated like we were here we went funjet , as always and our local rep got our return flight info the next day and never let us know what time our pick up was to go back to the airport first time for that too we 've always been warned about the time share people everywhere and have always avoided them however , this hotel is loaded with them everywhere you walk on the main grounds if you join the royal club you get preferential treatment with probably all of the things that were missing in our all inclusive vacation we 've never been exposed to distinctions and exlusions like this before and have heard that it may be a thing with the occidental hotel chain i hope we never encounter anything like this again my advice is to spend your vacation dollars in mexico , not in the dominican republic they 've got a long way to go before they even begin to compare - if ever i 'm quite sure from everything i heard that the entire country has electrical and plumbing problems aside from making the best of things on our own , this trip was a big waste of money i will go back to spending my money and tipping people who deserve it in playa del carmen from now on 
definately not four star we just returned from a one week stay at the occidental grand flamenco and let me say , had we known we would have booked elsewhere , definately not a four star resort we flew air transat and had a premium package upon arrival check - in was a breeze , definately would reccomend the premium package if you can get it , since we had our own check in desk felix was helpful for checkin , and we were assigned our room of 24230 once we reached our room , a good trek from the lobby , we were very disspointed in what we saw , very outdated , weird smell , and the bathroom was rusty in spots we proceeded then to request another room and were given 24103, worse still so went back to the better of the two still not what i would call anywhere near a four star , maybe a three on a good day the beach was beautiful and the water was great the challenge came with getting a beach chair , after waking up the first morning at 7am and seeing 90% of the chairs with towels on them , we became just another person in the chair races do not count on sleeping in at all if you want any chance of getting a good chair , it seemed to get worse as the week progressed , on the last day we were at the beach laying claim at 5:45am , and believe it or not half the chairs were already taken the food was ok , at best all the a la carte restaurants had mediocreservice and food quality that bordered on the same water pressure was somewhat of a luxury , as was water temperature beware , two days there was absolutely no hot water that would even come out of the tap , just gargled and spat gross smelling muddy substance out all i can say is good luck to whoever goes there , if you go there expecting a two to three star you will enjoy your experience just do not go there expecting anymore , or you 'll be seriously dissapointed 
terrible 04/03/07we stayed at the occidental 03/23/07 to 03/30/07 and had a miserable time the resort itself looks beautiful , however most of the staff is very rude especially the bartenders , when you order a drink they give the impression that you are bothering them on most days or nights the power would go off , not really bad in the daytime but at night it was ridiculous one day and night the electric was off for more than 12 hours straight and if the power goes out none of the plumbing works at all that includes all running water and the toilets do not function either we have stayed many times in mexico at all inclusive resorts and have been pampered at each resort there is no pampering at this hotel no poolside service - no room service etc the grounds are not laid out very well either , and are poorly organized when it rained a lot of the first floor rooms flooded , and they had to shut down part of the buffet area because of sever roof leaks the food however was pretty good we will never stay there again 
will never go back we arrived at the occidental after 12 hours of travelling on 1 07 to be told the resort was overbooked we were told we were going to a 5- star resort going back a half hour closer to the airport the resort was no more then a 2- star and had to stay there for 2 nights once we got picked up to go to the occidental , there was an entire bus load of travelers who also got bumped had to wait in line for a long period of time once we arrived to check - in as all 60+ passengers along with other travelers needed to check in too they tried to bump us once again to another resort , luckily that didnt happen did hear other staff members bumping any new travelers who had not been previously bumped it was awful once we finally got a room , which is average , the remainder of the trip was o there were 7 of us in our party - -5 were very sick with stomach aligments one person had it for 2 weeks after going home and my son who is 3 also had it what a nightmare on a positive note , the beach is gorgeous the resort is nice and enjoyed the pool the buffet was good for all meals we did try the hacienda restaurant which was good will never go back to this resort again be careful when booking , hopefully you wont get bumped once you arrive 
stay away arrived on january 15th 2007, by january 17th early afternoon i was unable to leave my room from extreme stomach problems it really doesn?? matter what the rest of the resort looks like i was unable to see it anyway all of the food is tepid or luke warm and no one really seems to care at all about it some of the worst service i??e ever experienced in my life arrived home on january 22nd and am currently doing a course of antibiotics to kill what ever is in me hey at least i?? not running for the washroom anymore 
severe stomach sickness i rarely have a negative thing to say about any vacation , but this entire experience was horrible i 've traveled throughout the caribbean ( bahamas , jamaica , cayman , cozumel , st thomas , st maartin , bermuda , etc ) and i have to conclude that anyone who said this was nice must not have traveled much to compare : dirty , terrible roads , no shopping at all except for local trinkets , no jewelry deals like st thomas , no alcohol deals like cozumel , nothing , few excursions , windy beach resort : 1 old 1970's looking , paint peeling2 bad service - upon arrival they never took our bags to the room , so we dragged them across the property and up 3 floors ( no elevators ) ourselves we call for pick up on departure and they never showed up either electricity would go out4 tv stations worked only sporadically5 never once had a hot shower6 food - ok , but you ca not expect to get what you have at home7 worst of all severe stomach sickness there are stickers on bathroom mirrors warning not to drink water , which we did not , yet still 3 of 4 travelers were very sick with stomach cramping , nausea , and severe diarrhea it was so bad we could not leave resort for any excursions at all i 've never seen a line for the bathroom on an airplane like this , so it 's not just this resort overall , you get what you pay for i went to riu in ocho rios jamaica 1 month before this trip , and that was a palace compared to here for about the same price , go to riu instead it is beautiful and so is jamaica without the water sickness problems 
worst vacation ever my husband , self and college aged daughter returned from this vacation yesterday 08/03/06 we arrived on 07/29/06 at 3:00pm their advertised check in time , however we did not get our room until 4:30 pm we were given our key and no assistance was offered with our bags we were in bldg 22 room 219 the room was outdated but clean the ac did not work and after 2 days of constant calling complaining and finally throughing a temper trantrum we were moved to another room that reeked of smoke however the ac worked so we did 'nt push our luck now on to the food the buffets are horrible the italian and oriental restaurants are ok we had a very hard time making reservations and again had to resort to throughing a temper tantrum to get reservations , which is ridiculous because we paid a lot of money for this vacation now on to the bars when ordering your drink do not forget to ask for liquor or you wo not get any we had good and bad bartenders we had good and bad wait staff we tipped according to services received although we were told it was included in our package our maid serivice was fine the groundkeepers work very hard and that is why the beach and pool are the best features of this property the spa is wonderful if you 're currently looking to purchase an all inclusive package steer clear of this property because you 'll be very disappointed if you 've already purcahsed a pacakage and are stuck with it do as we did , make the best of it and learn from your bad experience and trust the bad reviews next time oh , and by the way this is the only bad review of a property i have ever given i would 'nt normally take the time to complain but this property really has a lot of nerve calling itself a 4 star hotel , at best it is a 2 star hotel we could 'nt wait to get home and will never return 
love the island , beach not the resort ontario , what a disappointment just came back from a week stay at bavaro princess , d r , big disapointment , before booking the trip for nineteen of my family , i read the reviews on this resort , some were good and some were bad , since it is a five star resort , we are not very picky peaple , and have traveled to punta cana many times before and always had a great time , we stayed at b p from dec/18 2008 to dec/25/2008 , when we arrive at the resort , it seem like a pretty nice place but seem to be a little dimmed around the lobby , the check in went o k , no wellcome cocktail drinks , we proceeded to have our dinner , it was just o k with less variety than usual the room we had was near the beach and the main pool , therefore was very convinient for the kids , all of our rooms had crockcroaches and some even had crockcroaches eggs under the pillow cases , we ate at japanese alacart and the seafood , both time we ordered food , everything ended up to be the same , waste of time , food quality was terrible , evening shows were boring , perhaps inexperience m c made it even more boring , most of the staffs were nice at the bars and at the restaurants , ground keepers worked tiredlessly to keep the property look pretty nice , we enjoyed the wild lifes , flemingos , peakcocks , fish , birds ects the most disappointment aprt of the hold trip was the animacion ( enterainment ) crews , they do not seem to have much connection with the resort guests but maby think of themselfs as somekind of superstars , not even a genuend friendly hola , around the pool there were 'nt much activity , first five days , we did 'nt even hear any local music played , only techno music , it did ' 'nt give the feeling of beeing away , so in summory , the trip was a ripoff , we paid for a 5 star resort but only got maby 3 5 star service would not recommend to any of our friends and definately not going back to bavaro princess resort 
avoid this resort at all costs it was the worst vacation ever : all - you can eat closed just as we arrived from the airport the resort is too large there is no quality assurance policy : if you complain : no one cares and they will retaliate sneekily : most of the employees all know each other and stick together : i the guy at the check - in desk is the same guy who gives out the towels at the pool and who also dances in the evening show the pool and beach side music had one cd : bob marley : they played it over and over all day long they offer you a drink from a jug that contains weeds and say it is a shooter : it will give you diarehha for 2 days there is no disco the return flight was changed two hours earlier and the hotel staff made no effort to inform us : while we waited for the shuttle : they knew full well it had already came : we had to catch a taxi and then missed the flight and had to pay for a new flight home : the airport did not take credit cards : the medical doctor seemed to have knowledge of prescription drugs in the room which would suggest someone was going through personal belongings while we were at the beach do not leave the resort : it is very dangerous 
we were told that this was a five apple resort and were very dissappointed to find that it was not the case rooms need refurbishing badly patio furniture is filthy tub was in terrible condition air conditioning not working as well as mini bar in our first room had trouble with lights not working when i plugged my hair dryer in it fried it the beach was not kept groomed garbage left out in view trash containers on beach not emptied regularly pool , although pretty to look at , needed work large areas of pool bottom were chipping most of the service was very poor were only given 2 towels per day and no washcloths when i asked for washclothes i was told they did not have any although platinum , guests were given them if you were not a platinum guest , you got poor everything when we tried to make reservations for restaurants we were told that they were already booked up that was a lie they only opened 1 per night although their ad tells you about a number of bars , they were not all open when we were there they also were charging for drinks in their disco when their ad says free drinks until 2:30 a 
americans do not go we stayed at the resort from july 31 to august 7 we will never return back we are open minded people and do not complain about a lot of things , we have traveled to punta cana , mexico and jamaica we realize that we are not in the states the resort was too large , and we had our two kids the trams were always full and the rude people from the other countries would jump in front of you no matter where we have traveled we have always had great service we were always figyhting to get help the others that spoke spanish were helped right away and got better service we had little bugs in our room they were like ants , i think they came off the fresh flowers they leave in your room that did not bother us but the roaches did they were in the bathroom and they were little ones so i called and they sprayed our room the next day we had roaches in our bedroom that were at least 1-2 inches long i wanted to go home the night before we left i found 2 in our suitcases i have never had this experience anywhere we have traveled our suitcases never came in our house and i washed everything keep them closed we had a sewage smell coming from our bathroom the room had a broken towel rack and some mildew , but that did not bother us we never had towels , we had to call every night at 6: 00 to get some the wet bar sink lifted up , and had no water connected to it i poured some water in it to empty a bottle out and it went on the floor the drain was not even connected i felt like a total outsider there we not treated like the others the beach and the grounds were awesome they were always working although there is a sewer plant that the tram passes and it almost made me get sick when we passed it i was very glad to get home after 2 days there i was counting the days to go home that has never happened the food is nothing to brag about my kids survived on pasta noodles and rice i had salad most of the time and nachos overall , do not book i tought it would be ok because i saw the mixed reviews it was a good deal , but never again this is not a 5 star resort 
head the warnings and bad reviews book somewhere else my wife and i booked our honeymoon through a travel agent in our area with apple vacations the price seemed more than fair and by the personal recommendation of the travel agent we booked our honeymoon to the bavaro princess resort in punta cana we paid for the platinum upgrade , which as explained to us , would entitle us to premium alcohol , nicer room , extra nice meals and other amenities upon arriving at our resort , we were taken to the platinum lounge were we proceeded to wait for two hours before we could check in to our room now , we do understand that people may have checked out of that room late , but after observing how slow the housekeeping was during the week , we are guessing that was the cause after waiting over two hours for our room to be ready , we went to the room to find it in what had appeared to be immaculate condition right down to the label on the toilet suggesting it was sanitized considering my wife is a clean freak , she inspected the toilet before going to the bathroom to find that there was human ficies still smeared on and around the sanitized toilet outraged , we called the platinum lounge to express our concern and they assured us that someone would be over right away to re - clean it several phone calls later and several hours having passed , a maid did finally show up to clean said toilet a few hours later we spent some time killing huge cock roaches that seemed to come out of the wood work near the tv and couches we expressed our concern about these issues to the apple rep at our resort and he assured us he would take care of it he did offer to have our room exterminated but we would not be able to be in it for several hours after several hours later and several times of reminding him that we were waiting to hear back from him , he informed us that the manager was going to send champaign to our room for the inconvenience the following day , our 10 dollar bottle of champaign arrived with a small cheese plate this behind us , we proceeded to enjoy the rest of our honeymoon the food at the resort restaurants was absolutely terrible my wife and i both got sick from something we either ate or drink as did several other couples we met throughout our time there the restaurants that were included as part of our platinum upgrade were worse then the buffet food in the main dining room we paid for the platinum upgrade especially to receive the premium alcohol , and every time we asked for anything to be considered premium , they were out of it we did not get anything premium until we went to the bar at one of the sister resorts we were allowed to go to we booked two excursions with apple by recommendation of the reps at the resort , which were the outback safari and the dolphin island the outback safari was well worth our time and money and we enjoyed that day immensely the dolphin island excursion was a different story this excursion costs $110 a person , which is steep to begin with what a racket this excursion is the entire trip is supposed to be 5 hours and it was five and a half hours the bad thing is that only an hour of it was spent actually near the dolphins the trip to and from the island took over 30 minutes each way we spent an hour waiting to go out to the water after arriving the hour with the dolphins was amazing to say the least we were taken back to the beach where they proceeded to sell us dvds with photos from our experience this privilege cost us another 30 bucks after waiting another half hour we received our dvd and then proceeded to wait over two hours for them to organize everyone to get back on the buses to return to the resort several people were complaining to the staff but it seemed the staff was only concerned with making sure everyone bought a dvd before getting back on the buses i had read some reviews about this resort prior to traveling there and the most popular complaint was regarding transportation issues the resort is set on a few acres and it is a bit of a walk from the beach to the main lobby or from the rooms to the buffet the resort has a vehicle that stops at several designated areas to pick people up nine times out of ten this vehicle was full by the time it reached us so we decided to walk the rest of our time there this proved to be a bad idea since the road to walk on went through an area where the resort had a sewage problem i can?? even describe how bad the stench was in this area they even had caution tape around the majority of the area i am sure walking past this area four times a day on average was not good for our overall health the night before leaving we paid our bill so we could have express check out in the morning before our departure i asked guest services when i should call in the morning to have our baggage picked up so we could have time to eat before our bus came they informed us that ten minutes we be sufficient the morning came and just to be on the safe side i called them 45 minutes prior to our scheduled departure time from the resort 35 minutes later , they finally showed up to grab our baggage and we raced to the main lobby to catch our bus we had no time to eat and it was the perfect ending to a miserable vacation 
big mistake if anyone is trying to make the decision whether to stay at bavaro princess - - - do not i got on travel advisors and there was enough pictures and negative things that i wish i had listened to them but i was stupid and listened to those that would say the oppisite and convince me that the people writting were just negative people they were not , believe me i 've went to punta cana 6 times and always stayed in a 5 or 6 apple resort and i know the difference bavaro princess should be rated no more than a 3 my friend and i arrived there may the 12th and the bell boys took our luggage and showed us where to catch the tram and we waited and waited just like people had said we would we finally walked to our room which had not been cleaned , i turned the tv on to see if we got any latin music because i love it and the tv was not working the maid reported it , , then after she left we was looking the room over , , sure enough like we had been advised , , there was bugs , mildew on the walls , and the light in the bathroom would not work i called to report that and then we got ready to go eat we went out to the tram stop and waited again for 10 minutes and finally the tram came , , , full , , we finally walked and it was a long walk , believe me , , i was told about the sewage smell but again did not believe it , , i do now , , it was terrible dinner was good until later when i was running to the bathroom often , it was too dark in the main lobby and we went to the show which was a magic show , very boring well we decided to go in , get some sleep and start over tomorrow no tv and no light in the bathroom , , luckily i took a flashlight the next morning i was so sick i could not eat breakfast and soon after breakfast my friend was sick we went to apple and ask to be moved after checking around , they found us a great resort and we moved please if you 're thinking about going look some more i 'm really upset that apple would rate this place a 5 as bad as it was i 'm sure if these people that give great reviews had been to any other resorts they 'd realize that bavaro princess has a lot of problems our vacation was ruined from getting an enzyme or poisoned the first day i go to enjoy everything , , always look foward to the food , drinks , entertainment , , i missed all of that and was moved to a fabulous resort but was too sick do not be pulled in by the good price like i did , , i regretted it i hope you 'll listen to me 
worst service i 've ever had just returned from 5 days at the bavaro princess resort we have travelled extensively around the world and a lot in the carribean we love to mix with locals when possible and really enjoy the culture unfortunately , punta cana does not make that very feasible the place is filthy dirty , runned down and generally not safe for tourists the grounds of the resort were very nice , however really needed better upkeep the rooms were in dire need of upgrade renovations the resort offered a platinum package which vacations to go were not aware of however i was able to negotiate that when i arrived the package gives you access to premium liquors ( or all they have is no name brands ) it allows you free internet access , slipper and robes in your room and clean beach towels delivered to your room daily also entrance to the specialty restaurants for free ( normally a fee of $30 00 per person ) it also gives you a private butler on the beach or just someone to take your orders so you do not have to keep going up to the bar/restaraunt we did not recieve the slippers , robes or beach towels until our last night there was no premium liquor they only had 2 brand name liquor and 1 brand name beer corona at any given time and they were sold out by 2 in the afternoon so we never did have premium liquor the free entrance to the specialty restaruant was allocated to us at by a date determined by the resort and in our case fell on the day before we recieved our vouchers then when we tried to re - book the restaurant was closed to private functions ( how pathetic ) i never saw a server on the beach once and we were on the beach from 8:00 to 4:00 everyday the cost to the upgrade was $35 00 per person per night it is a must that both people in room pay the cost it cost me 285 i was very disappointed also out of the 50 people working at the resort only 2 spoke english no one at any bar or restaurant spoke english at all we tried every night to order wine there was a list for those who wanted to pay extra the first night we ordered they came back to us after we finisheddinner with a different bottle saying they were out of what we ordered but that this was similar we order a differnt bottle every night of our 4 night stay and ended up getting the same stand in bottle as apparently they do not really have a wine list just a facade other than the fact the beach was very nice and water was great it was a poor excuse for a resort there were less than desireable people occupying the resort which i 'm not at liberty to describe due to content control of this website in my opinion they do not deserve a tourist industry 
disgusting the rooms are disgusting , dirty , and infested with mosquitos i stayed at dreams for a week ( had a fantastic experience there ) , and on the day we were to leave , our flight was delayed 9 hours , so sunwing put us up at the bavaro princess for one night the bavaro princess is nothing compared to dreams the rooms may be a little bigger , but the tub was rusting , the shower curtain had stains on it , there was a leak in the closet we had no moquitos at dreams whatsoever , and the princess had them everywhere , they do not take care of their grounds very well i did not get a chance to explore the grounds as we arrived at night the buffet had no choices and the food was all cold stay away from this hotel , book dreams instead dreams is amazing 
go go vacations - terrible experience go go vacations , bavaro princess hotel , punta cana , dominican republic  trip dates : july 02, 2007 thru july 11, 2007this letter was an official complaint sent to gogo vacations and hotel : for deplorable and unacceptable condition of trip accommodations provided by go go vacations , bavaro princess hotel we paid for first class accommodations in your hotel and received :1) at our arrival room was not ready when we got the room it had only one bed ( all accommodations noted 4 people ) we did not get room serviced until day 3 4) hotel smelled like sewer ( so strong that it caused head aches and nausea ) ( later learned there was problems with water lines )5) we got poisoned by hotel food on 6 ( six on july 7, 8, 9 ( that?? 3 days we did not have hot water 7) shower in our room had not enough pressure to operate , during our stay we requested remote control for tv on two occasions and did not get it at all we requested safe key and did not get it at all the service at main restaurant ( next to lobby ) was non - existent : we had to ask for water or drinks for at least 3 times ( and there is no self service allowed ) and on one occasion had to wait for 45 minutes to get water ( in 95degree weather with kids at the table ) , plates where cleaned up very sporadically and it was very obvious that priority was given to spanish - speaking guests over english - speaking gests all the time on numerous occasions there was not enough forks and teaspoons during lunch hours11) the auto - train running on premises had no room for guests about 20% of the time and except for one had no room for strollers , making it effective waiting time close to 20-30 minutes on departure from hotel puerto tours bus was scheduled to pick us up to the airport at 8:30 am and after multiple calls finally arrived to the hotel at 9:25am causing us quite a fear of missing the plane ( flight scheduled at 11:25 and route to hotel about 30 minutes ) , by the time we entered airport our plane was finishing boarding we requested full refund and after 2 month of arguments we were refunded 2 days ' cost , and offered $100 credit by gogo if booked thru themplease note there are so many great hotels in punta cana , this one should be avoided at any costs ( it took us 3 weeks just to recuperate and endless comunications with gogo to get this resolved , to their satisfaction ) 
do your homework before you book at the bavaro princess if you don?? care about cockroaches , mosquitoes , and floods in your suite , then the bavaro princes is your destination if you don?? care about customer service and fighting your way to get something to eat or find a spot around the swimming pool , then the bavaro princes is your destination i belive long time ago this resort used to be 5 stars , but through time , they lost at least 1 5 to 2 starts i strongly believe this resort should be rated at 3 on a positive note , the beach was fantastic and the food was okay? 
the worst resort we ever been at my husband and i are frequent travelers out of the country , and we have never had an experience quite like this after eating at the japanese restaurant , several hours later we both became terribly ill , as well as several others in our party so sick , we had to be seen by the hotel doctor at the buffets you could see many bugs around and in the food we lost several days of our vacation due to being laid up in the room we complained to hotel management both during and after our stay , and they did not offer any satisfaction nor did the travel company who put this charter together let me tell you about the hotel room smelled of mold with visible mold and cracks on the walls and cieling leaky malfunctioning plumbing and faulty electrical faulty electrical we were lucky if our room was cleaned by 5pm every day if you prefer an oceanview room , there are very few the only thing we actually liked at this resort was the beach very beautiful , smooth , walkable long strech 
very , very bad my family vacation was ruined by terrible service in this hotel there were no water and toilets were leaky rooms was full of roaches and was not cleaned until 5 p some problems was with towels to change overall the place is generally insanitary due to shortage of water alex , new york 
rd not any more a travelling choice i have just return from a 14 days stay in that pricess hotel on arrival my agent ask for beach view they gave my the most far door from the beach you can have at this hotel , the room smell mould a lot , there was black mould all arround the bath tub , the door on patio side have been forced so it was not possible to lock it , it is a fist floor room we had to spend more than half an hour with the reception to have an other room the other room on the same model except my wife and i had to sleep on twin bed because they had only this room with twin beds to offer the room was not clean because there was sans on the floor , burn and broken fixtures in the bathroom , also there was some birds excrement on the door frame the first morning we want to use the coffee maker but there was no electrical outlet near by for it , the wire was 1 foot long , we hade to use the bathroom outlet after few days we notice , the small fridge in the room was not refilled every day as per advertised we had to ask for beer and soft drink , there was no face cloth , we ask for 2 but they could find out only one for us , some days we had 3 towels some days 2, some days 4, some days we had body lotion some days conditionner some days shampoo and most of the time we had to ask to have something who was missing the only thing they do okay it the beds and that 's allthe food was good but the service is very very poor even for the buffet , there is some food or beverage who was only served by waiter , but be very patient and repeat often what you want and be patient again there is 5 a la carte restaurants food is good but one night at the japanese they were washing the floor , wich was very dirty , while we were eating , after the lunch the waiter told us to to go into the entrance to have our desert on a very low table on the second week there are some friends (5) who have been sick after eating in the japenese restaurant the personel of the hotel seem to be nice only if you tip , they do not do think if you do not tip they are arrogant and they do not us to spend any more money in their hotel and countrythis is not a 5 stars hotel this may be 3 1/2 stars at the most but they charge for a 5 stars and they irritate you all the time with a dolars , even my wife was ask for a dollars at the hotel jewellry guy while she was looking the jewellery in the counteri do not recommand bavaro pricess hotel even i will not return to dominican republica i will spend my money somewhere else 
prepare yourself for a nightmare we went to bavaro princess for a wedding with about 25 people the trip started off good the hotel is visually beautiful and beach is amazing that 's were it ends the customer service is the worst i ever received - i can go on and on about that for intance waiting for room service for over an hour on more than one occasion wating for a day for an addtional blanket everytime you called to follow up on requests for room service - you were received with an argument on the phone asking am i sure that i spoke to that person etc we had about 5 or more from our group that became ill from the food one even had to be taken to the hospital during our stay the night of the wedding no special accomidations were made for the bride or the groom the reception was held outside in a sectioned off area that the staff continued to let other guest walk right through reception party ( we actually had a drunk hotel guest come up during the reception and ask if he could have a piece of cake ) are minimal examples of things gone wrong - it was a short story horror what ever customer service mishap could happen - happened after the first two illnesses i was so afraid to eat i stuck with bread and rice i still got sick came home and was in bed for two full days if you still have time make another reservation if you already made it here if you havent made one yet - do not make it with tis hotel 
lizards/bugs in the room stay away from this resort our room came with : patio lights that worked sometimes , lamp in living room did not work , kitchen sink did not work , shower had only a trickle of pressure , kitchen counter had small bugs , maid service at 9:30 p , cockroaches , lizards inside the room , a filthy dirty floor and terrible cleanliness when we talked to mgmt , they sprayed the room for insects and gave us a fruit basket  bottle of rum we were never offered another room we were falsely accused of taking a photo from the pictures they take  sell we were cleared of course kinda hard to take something ( a photo of us w/ a monkey ) , we never had we opened our towels  beach bag , showing an untruthful accusation to be ridiculous we never had our photo taken with a monkey the food was fine the steak house was great , as was the service in every other area of the resort the beach was the best beach we ever sawthe pool is great the grounds are huge and maintained beautifully anything mother nature provided , the beach , the grounds , are kept spectacular anything else , the room and cleaning was disgusting we will never stay here again 
hated the whole trip we went to the dominican republic for my nephews wedding i thought i would have a great time and really looked forward to this vacation oh was i wrong we arrived at the hotel after 3pm we had 2 rooms booked , neither one of the rooms were ready we had to wait over 1hour for our rooms we had no where to change cloths because the hotel took our luggage when we arrived that was the beginning of our nightmare when we finally we able to get into our rooms , the smell of mold was horrible the curtians had black mold on them the shower had only water dripping out of the shower head and the water smelled like we showered in sewer water one of our rooms toilet did not work for four days we only stayed five days thank goodness our rooms were across from each other so we can use the other toilet after finally getting settled and changed , we went to find dinner the dominican people on the resort were not friendly at all they treated americans very bad i noticed if you did not speak spanish and were american you were treated like trash ever person i spoke to from america said the same thing one couple i spoke to said that they have been to other resorts in the dominican and were treated so much better they rated this resort as a zero our rep from vip tours who was at the resort to help us , us very rude and was very unhelpfur to us she was only avail if lucky 2 hours a day which as in the middle of the day so you had to work your day around her schedule also she was never on time my overall experience of the dominican republic is terrible and i will never recommend anyone to go there for a vacation 
wedding problems i have been looking for a great site for a punta cana wedding for months i finally picked the bavaro princess but when it came down to it i could not book the wedding i called numerous times and they said i can only book if i sent them an e - mail so i did and got no response i had the date and a million invitations that needed to be sent out and warnings to guests that they need to get their passports it all fell through the hotel offered no help in booking the whole purpose for us to go down there i have totally wasted months in trying to have the dream wedding me and my family and friends would want the hotel itself had it all and all close by it by far offered the perfect price , activities ( more vast than most resorts ) , and spacey rooms the wedding was a huge disappointment please be cautious i still have yet to get married 
after 2 days we had enough we spent in this hotel barely 2 days of weekend , taking voluntarily temporary assingement form our occidental flamenco hotel due to overbooking it was quite a disaster , we were so happy to leave bavarro and return to flamenco the only good thing was a room clean spacious and bright , we had no problem accomodate in 4 ppl one bed had broken leg , but they fixed it the very next day ac working great , decent bathroom etc also , the beach was nice , finding palatas was relatively easy even in afternoon hours and thats about the only positives we could say this resort is spread on vast grounds , the trains seem to be always crowded , and finding seat during evening hours seemed impossible the worst was food the main buffet is open without ac , we did not enjoy eating while getting sweat at the same time and food was bad , plain and tasteless one evening it was all about oriental food , we noticed more ppl ended up @ american station taking hamburgers and hotdogs rather than oriental cuisine and final nail was chopin restaurant not sure why its called that , because its in fact an open buffet , with lots of seafood while i am a seafood lover , after it i ended up with food poisoning for entire our remaining time in dr and to tell the truth , after all iiwas not surprised , seeing flies and moths getting cozy in some salads so after spending 2 days in bavarro , we could not wait to get back to occidental flamenco , where we enjoyed far superior quality and overall satisfaction 
honeymoon gone bad we went to the bavaro princess resort for our honeymoon we got there on july 30 through august 4th i hated every day and could not wait to come home our trip started out bad and kept getting worse we got into the dominican republic airport 2 1/2 hours late after sitting at the phl airport for way too long we meet our transportation which was this mini van who took us to the hotel with only us in the vehicle and a spanish speaking driver the worse thing about this hotel is that ever one speaks spanish and very little english the entertainment is all in spanish the music is in spanish the service is terrible and trying to communicate with anybody is impossible we purchased a honeymoon suite w/jaccuzzi arriving to the hotel they stated that they have no suites with jaccuzzi and gave us a room near the beach i could care less that i was near the beach i absolutly hated this resort i am so disappointed in my travel agencies and the vip services who did absolutely nothing for us while we were there 
4th and last time last week i stayed at this resort , party of 2 we had platinum service this was my 4th visit in 3 years to this resort , all of which were either platinum , or the previous vip program the vacation was through ac vacations , and the flight down from toronto was excellent we were bumped up to business class for free at the gate , and the flight was on time we arrived at the resort at around 11am , and after waiting for one of the golf carts that ferries guests around for 10 minutes in order to go check in at the platinum lounge , we have up and walked to it - - since we are familiar with the resort when we got to the lounge , we were the first to check in from our arriving group , suggesting the golf cart transportation had still not arrived perhaps not suprisingly , our room would not be ready until 3pm , the stated check in time that 's fine we just went to lunch and waited around when we went back at 3, they told up 3:30 more waiting , and more waiting ensued until 4:30, when we were given our room why was not my room ready well , my room was not ready because the guest in there before just did not check out i was comforted by the desk agent by him telling me that they had charged the guest $40 dollars for our inconvenience of course , we were not given the $40 bucks , or really anything for that matter other than shrugged shoulders the room was ideally situated , close to the pool , beach and lounge but the a/c hardly worked , and the water pressure all week was terrible we got fed up with the a/c on the second day , and they moved us up to an ocean view suite which also had bad a/c , no water pressure , no hot water except at times that you do not need it ( like 2pm ) i complained a few times , but eventually gave up - - not worth the effort , as the management was pretty apathetic we met two other couples who had the same problems in platinum in fact , one couple was given a non - platinum suite and the only compensation offered was an extra 20 min massage and that was after a lot of effort going through the ac vacations rep food : the only things i had all week that were good was steak at el gaucho , pasta at the pasta station in the hispaniola buffet , and boiled eggs by the beach in the morning my partner actually picked up some rotten pineapple at one of the buffets , which was less than appetizing to her the food here has really went downhill the worst was el pescador , the fish restaurant everything was cold , and tasted bad luckily , a guest services manager was hovering around in that restaurant and intercepted me as i was leaving this was the only positive experience i had with management , as she apologized and immediately had us seated at el gaucho this resort needs more of that kind of management beach : excellent , although many of the chaise loungers were broken sea was just marvelous pool : dirty it was painted white , and you could see yellow slime on the sides of the pool otherwise , the pool was good the pool bar was often understaffed - - one guy trying his darnedest to serve a full bar of people a couple of the days they put 2 guys on and it was better casino : that was ok , had fun at $10 blackjack , but the a/c there was a bit weak too excursions : ( this has nothing to do with the hotel , by the way ) we did the saona excursion , and it was bad it is a long bus ride , then you go out on speed boats which was very fun they take you to a natural pool in the ocean and feed you drinks , then back into the boat for a ride over to saona , which is supposedly an unspoiled beach what we got was an unspoiled beach that was set up with relentless dominican craft vendors , where we had to spend 3 hours after that , we had a wonderful sail for 1 5 hrs in a tropical storm , then a bus ride to punta cana with a stop in higuey - - actually , they dumped us at a tourist place where we could buy rum and paintings at american prices the highlight of the trip was coming home will be the paradisus palma real where we went at christmas it is more expensive , but at the same time you do get something for your money 
bavaro princess hotel - no no when we arrive at our room , the odor was horrible it stinks like hell in the room we asked for a new room in this new room , it was impossible to stay on the balcony because there was a broken pipe beside and it smells bad again during 3 days , we took cold shower even if we ask to fix it one time , the front desk told me let the water running till i get hot water we tried to do reservations in their restaurants but there was no place available the front desk told us that we have to reserve before 7h30 in the morning to have a chance to have an available table one night , at the sea food restaurant , we ate a langoustine and 4-5 hours after , my daugthter and me were in an ambulance to go to the hospital we stayed there for almost 2 days you will regret it 
not even close to 5* rating i booked my trip to dominican republic through applevacations for starters , i got my papers 3 days late , even though they sent it through fedex the flight from sfo to atlanta was ok , then i connected there to punta cana let me start with the rating applevacations it 's not accurate at all the property is old , the mattreses in my suite were covered in g - d knows what the mini fridge had a broken freezer barely wam water in the shower and those monstrous cockroaches i have never seen that big of a cockroach it flew too now the stuff speaks minimum english , when u tell them to fix a broken hairdryer , their 5 minutes , sir turned into 2-3 days one of the floor manager by the name armando is a liar when we booked on of those dinners at the 5 of the restaurants on site , the stuff at chopin spoke no english at all they showed us a wine list and we thought it was all included at the end of our dinner they brought us a piece of paper , saying that we owe 53$+26% tax for the bottle of wine i had a huge argument at the check - out day with that armando guy when i called applevacations com to resolve that issue for me , he lied to them , saying that stuff speaks perfect english so on that sour note , i say this place is a big no - no 
do not stay here we had a group of twelve people ( eight adults , four children ) and not one of us was satisfied with the resort although the beaches and pool where very nice the rooms , food and service where terrible the rooms : our group had four rooms three of the four rooms smelled like mold we had to demand a new room for one of the families in our group due to ants in the bed the water pressure in the showers was very bad and the hot water was luke - warm at best the food : the resort has a reservation system for all the restraunts except one buffet of the seven nights we where there we had to eat at the buffet all but two due to the lack of open tables at the other restraunts to make reservations you must be at the front lobby at 8:00 am the day before you want the reservation ( i do not know about you but i enjoy sleeping in on vacation ) we did not have any meals at this resort that would be anywhere near five star most of the time we ate the fresh fruit and noodles from the pasta bars the service : the best way to sum up the service at the bavaro princess is that the staff just does not care at meals it was hard to get served drinks at most meals there was not enough silverware on the tables of the two times that we did have reservations they messed one of them up ( they tried to make us eat at 10:00 pm instead of 8:00 pm ) they charged $24 us for a two minute local phone call from the room when we complained about the smell in the rooms they did nothing about it there where times of the day when you could not get anything to eat the bars and restraunts hours where not convienent the entertainment was not very good the only pool was closed from 7:00 pm until 8:00 am for chemical treatment the public restrooms where not clean overall the best advice i can give you on the bavaro princess is do not stay here 
would not recommend this place we just returned from a week at the princess bavaro and very disappointing nowhere near a 5 star hotel the accommodation provided through sunwing tours was sub standard and not clearly described there are 3 levels of accommodation/service and the top being platinum , one might have a better experience if you are able to book this level this is a huge property and a beautiful one at that , however , the staff were clearly unable to handle the numbers of guests we found that if you were fluent spanish you also had a better chance of better , quicker service we had a medical emergency in our group , and fortunately it was only a perforated eardrum and the response to our request for assistance was very upsetting had it been anything more serious and you could not speak spanish , it could be very serious consequences yes it is a different country and reference is continuously made to dr time , they are still charging top prices for substandard service the buffets were adequate but the individual restaurants , sakura , pescadora , chopin , were awful when we asked for assistance at the casino the dealer rolled her eyes at us because we were not able to communicate in spanish clearly not customer focused for all guests the beach is beautiful , but it was very crowded and the water was very rough very windy at this time of year however no one makes this clear before you travel we have been to all but 5 islands in the carribbean and this experience has been the most disappointing 
terrible grauenhaft we stayed 2 weeks ambiente of the resort is nice ( viewed from distance ) if you look closer : maximum 3- star - place food  wine : disgusting i talked to the manager of restaurants and services he agreed with me kidsclub : forget it 2 tv sets in the miniclub running all day long no kids entertainment the kids were bored to death rooms : 3- star - rating maximum service : non existing : f e : you have to line up for registering in the restaurans ( we are takling about a 5 star place ) pool : quite dirty animation : boring but the evening shows are ok beach : nice and clean summary : if do not expect 5 star food , service , etc it 's ok but remember : do not pay more than for a 3 star hotel 
tried to enjoy ourselves - but didnt booked our trip with air transat - nolitours our plan was delayed 4hrs at yvr so we did not arrive untill 3:30am staff were somewhat friendly and spoke moderate english , got our mickey flask of rum and were escourted to our room - ( by an eager porter looking for a tip ) first impression good - we were in room 11109 ( swim out room in building 11) room was spacious , bright , seemed clean over the next 6 days we had some not great experiences with room such as : the stinky/musty/tropical/cigar/urine smell , bed was hard , had 1 gecko in room , were told we were not allowed to flush toilet paper , maids forgot to clean rooms one day , air conditioning work but had only one setting - mega cold - , barely any hot water ,  we found over all , the restaurants to have really bad serviceaqua - exclusive ( cameleon etc ) - ok , very bad service , tables not cleaned , pre - used silverware sitting at place settings , food most often cold with flies around windows - usually something edible , bad service in most sections - but good waiter in the back middle section finally took care of bringing us drinks , water , cutlery etc often flies around desserts ( because all have sugery glazes on them ) and fruits food recycled from meal to meal and not really refrigerated de mario - good food , ok service - - gong show to get reservations at any alacarte restaurant - what they do is let the rest fill up at 6pm and then start taking a waiting list after that time - so if you send one member from your famliy up from the pool to book a table they had to wait sometime 30-40 mins to get a time to come back poorly managed ( often tables sat empty for long periods of time after first dinners left ) beach garden - ok if starving - got shooed out of sitting inside at 3pm because they were trying to get tables ready for the dinner sitting but did not close untill 4pm - fries were always cold ( on that note - saw hotel staff with a chiquta banana box carrying cooked french fries from behind windows rest down the path to the bg rest - not covered ) did not go to seafood restaurantamerican grill - tex mex - - great food ( veal tenderloin was hubbys fav ) again same type of mis - management as de mario - one night we waited outside untill 630 cuz they were seting tables , but were told the 'cooker had not shown up yet '*note - they say you can only go to the alacarte restarants 1 time , but we actually went to the italian 2 times and tex mex 3 times nobody asked for our coupon *bars were ok , drinks sometime rancid/strong - all alchohol was fake ( baileys in similar bottle but called sallys , no premium labels - all brugal ) beach - lots , walked past the 3 resorts to public not crowded beaches that was nice toopools - nice , favorite was the new one out back by building 15 great bar there often quite - no hot tub - what looks like a hot tub on the map is actually colder then pool its near by pools were kept clean/with out much debris , and i actually saw somebody scrubbing the 'scumline ' 2 times while theregrounds - really nice , pathways a little rough for wearing high heels but pretty flowers , flamingos and turtles to look atborrowed kayaks - paddled that was fun - did zip line with bavaro runners ( awesome ) cost $220 cdn - was supposed to go the marinariam tour but company forgot to pick us up - we waited at designated location but no one every showed up and we got to watch the boat drive away from pier with out us ( was told we were getting refund - will check credit card again to see if processed ) - took free shuttle to nicoles which is a store of a french canadian lady that sells jewlery , vanilla $3, santo domingo coffe $5, hand rolled cigars god prices wanted to get to hard rock cafe at the end ( to get some stable food ) however could not peice together enough information from the 6 people we asked about the 'free shuttle ' to the 'plaza del mar shopping centre ' which may or may not pick up a couple times a day we tried to enjoy oursevles but in the end the minor details got to us - - - especially the extra 16hr delay for the way back at the resort we found if you spoke spanish you got better service , howevereven then you might never get your drinks at dinner , and do not even try to ask for a modifcation to a meal at the a la carte restaurants our resort was set about 30mins away from others like bahai principe etc - there were 3 of us out there , you can see the marinarium and reef explorer locations from the hotel beach - they are right out front there is a very agressive market across the street from the hotel - 'my friend , my family come have a look ' , we would walk past to the mini market to get snacks much cheaper then resort mini - bar and store ( price on resort for pringles $5usd mini can , $3 chocolate bar ) in all like a said we went there with an open mind , we tried to like it but in the end were defeated by the continual rude/inattentive service i would never go back to the dominical republic not just based on this experience - but flying from vancouver is 6hrs 30mins there and 8hrs 30mins back - - - to enjoy nice beaches , tropical destination etc - i could do that in mexico within 4-5hrs 
trapped at the last minute , my friend and i decided to go somewhere warm and all inclusive for new years i returned last night ( january 5, 2009) my flight and hotel were very reasonable and i was looking forward to 6 days in the sun with fresh fish , fruit and the wonderful caribbean spirit what we got instead was dismal service , food that was inedible and all red wine stored in large fruit juice plastic bottles while the staff was always all smiles and calm , nothing was ever delivered or handled the restaurants that were advertised as part of the all inclusive were mysteriously closed on the days you wanted to book them and when they were not , they had run out of food i would not wish this place on anyone the lack of customer service , quality assurance and training for the staff will catch up to them 
terribly over rated we just returned from a 2 week stay dec 19- jan 2 we had stayed here in feb 06 ( was punta cana grand then ) and thought it was great i ca not believe a resort could go so far downhill in that short a time checkin took forever very slow , inefficient and unorganized the little drink they give you while waiting does not help when it is midnight and you have been in line for an hour had to change rooms 4 times to get satisfactory room one neither door would lock the hall door had been kicked in and night lock hanging by screws , patio door would not lock toilet would not flush , phone did not work , etc other room had not been cleaned ( and by now it is 1 am ) the food is terrible at the buffet the only way to get hot food was the pasta bar or cooking station only overhead light bulbs keeping other food warm last day there saw ants all over the fruit , and a yellow coloured fly came out of a sweet roll i was eating friends saw a cockroach going across the floor service in buffet excellent but does not make up for quality of food dimarios was so bad we walked out and left food on table ceasar salad tasted like it had been cooked in fish tex mex restaurant really good but you can only eat at each a la carte once a week christmas and new years were done very well , but food quality a real issue adult pool is not maintained that way one day there was 6 little kids in the jacuzzi that we asked to leave their parents were very upset two other times we told kids they had to leave the staff does nothing about it this is also supposed to be the only area where topless is allowed , but not the case around the main pool , and on the beach , once again not supervised by the staff booked a trip to higuey that was supposed to be shopping at a market , visit a cathederal , tobacco place and a dominican lunch our driver spoke no english , took us to the church and said there you go , took us to one shop where he was angry we did not buy anything ( it was too expensive ) then took us to a supermarket ( we did not really need any groceries ) then he took us back to the hotel that trip was $60us a person we booked a trip to go on speedboats ( $75 us a person ) but they never came to get us as the sunwing rep wrote down the wrong time he wrote 12:25 am not pm logic would think that no one is going out in speedboats at midnight rep was mia for 2 days we got oyr refund as we were getting on the bus to airport ( after many calls ) pool is clean and good temp beach is nice except for the seaweed they clean it up once a day but needs done more often as there is a lot of it this was one of our worst vacations ever it also rained for 5 days ( that 's the chance you take ) which did not help we were so dissapointed as we had such a good time when here before this is rated 4 star and 5 star ( depending on the company ) but is barely a 3 
real bad i would like to write this review to let others of the problems they will run into when you get there food - bad - no variety , poor quality 2) rooms - not too nice , air conditioning really bad 3) bathrooms - often no water and no lights ( fun to use at night )4) representative ( conquest ) never there ( for 7 days )5) electricity - off 2 - 4 times a day 6) customer service - poor - two days to get them fix water leak in my bathroom after numerous complains 7) no bar on the beach casino - niceoverall - will not go back there again 
dont get married here i had 18 friends and family accompany me to the grand oasis punt cana dec 4-11th i was supposed to get married there ( my fiance and i broke up before the trip , so we turned it into a family vacation ) thank god i did not get married there as i would have been very upset our problems started at check in as an anniversary gift , my friends were going to upgrade to a suite they didnt have that available they put us in building 10 this is the new area so new in fact that after a long night of drinking we woke up to hammering , drilling at 0800 i then asked them to move us , as that was unacceptable if they are not done that section , they should not have people stay there we then all moved rooms to buildings 3 and 7 through out our week the power went off atleast 3 times , the maids went on strike , there were no face cloths , no beach towels , they charged me $22 for a local call , the list goes on and on they were so unorganized , i cant imagine how a wedding would turn out they told us we could get married on the beach , but there wasnt really any good place where they could have set it up i dont know why they would say that they have wedding packages all in all , we made the best of our trip when we initally booked it a year ago , reviews were good , and it was listed as 35th most popular hotel i would never tell friends to stay here half of our group was there for 2 weeks , and they stayed in a great hotel the first week they all said the grand oasis was terrible , the beach wasnt as nice , the staff was rude we even met some flight attendants the night before , on our flight home , they stated they will not be staying there anymore as the flight company needed to have certain standards for the price we paid , we totally got ripped off if you get a cheap deal , it would probably be o k , but dont even consider getting married there 
horrible - not a 5 star i would not recommend this place to anyone the hotel itself and staff over all was good , but it 's definitely not a 4 5 or 5 star resort they alway ran out of towel and sometimes did not have any at all the room we stayed on had a leak in the bathroom after it rained we called 6 times to get it fixed and 6 times they told us someone would fix it was never fixed they did not even offer to switch 
do not go to the grand oasis punta cana hello , just wanted to warn others about this hotel , the grand oasis punta cana , my wife and i tried to stayed there in april 2008 and were very disappointed i have been to the dominican several times before and have enjoyed the island and it 's people we are both very relaxed travellers and usually do not let the little things get to us , after all we are on holidays so here 's my rant , check in was a nightmare , slow and disorganized , and also found out that the hotel had been overbooked so we were put at a sister hotel , which was not up to the same standards as the hotel we paid for we did not actually get to stay at the hotel , my complaints are with the treatment from hotel staff , particularily reservations we were given a complimentry 1 week gift certificate as a good will gesture from the hotel for all the problems we had ( we did not request this or complain ) , the problem is trying to use it the certificate says just call and book 1 month in advance , i tried to do this ( well in advance ) and was given the run around from the start i spoke to reservations and was told there was lots of room in the resort at the time we wanted to go , once they found out that i was wanting to use the complimentry certificate things got complicated they requested a faxed copy of the certificate so they could verify it 's authenticity , from there on in it was frustrating trying to get ahold of anyone as they would not return my many calls or e - mails for over a week when they finally did get back to me they said that there was no room at the resort for the time we requested ( even though they already told us that there was lots of room ) it is apparent to me that they issued this certificate with the intention of never honoring it i will certainly never stay there again , nor will i book at another oasis hotel 
worst vacation of my life this hotel was a nightmare i went with friends and family and most of us got sick the first day we got there we went to eat at windows and there was no air conditioner they had the windows open and a big cockroach flew onto our table then a couple of night later we were going to eat at the same restaurant and we saw a mouse by the entrance and the server asked us if we were not going in and when we said no she replied just because of that there were also lots of flies all over he food the best meal that i had all week was a taco salad form wendys at the airport the service was horrible we never had any clean towels ( we always had to call for them to bring them up ) and the maid would start cleaning the room at like 6 in the afternoon so we had to leave our room just to let her clean and once we gave her a $10 tip and we told her to please make sure that we had at least 3 towels in the room and when we got back we didnt even have a hand towel we called the front desk and it took them like 30 mins to bring them to us there was also never any towels by the pool our room was never clean i have a baby who got sick witha fever and threw up all over the bed and the sheets had a red stain on them and i told the lady to please change the sheets and i went back to the room and i checked and it was the same sheet also , one night my friend sat at the end of the bed it broke and it took maintenance like 2 hours to come up so when we finally went to sleep the bed ( that they had just fixed ) broke again and my husband and i had to sleep in the bed like that we never had any toilet paper my friend called the fornt desk for toilet paper and it took them 30 min to come up while her daughter was sitting in the toilet waiting for it also we booked our hotel through apple vacations and our room service was included but when we got there they told us they charged $6 for froom service and we did it many times and then we found out we were not supposed to pay for it so when we told the manager they said there was nothing they could do about it because they didnt know which server it was also there was never any umbrellas by the pool becuase people would put their towels on the chairs and never come back and when we told management they said they didnt have any rules for that i 've read some reviews that say not to forget that it 's the south and people dont loive the same way and while that might be true , myself , being dominican ( born and raised ) , i never had service like that anywhere else i went i been to hotels in puerto plata and they 're absolutely beautiful and the service is great i had nevr been to punta cana before and going to the oasis made me not wanna go there again dominican republic is beautiful but if you go make sure you dont stay at the grand oasis pay the extra money and stay at the riu believe me its worth it 
the resort is big , but old everything is cracking , and falling apart needs a lot of maintenance the place is infested with flies specialy the main buffett restaurant it was terrible the flies were all over the food and on the tables most of the waiters and bartenders has attitudes is like they could care less the tv in my room went out , and it was not fixed they said it was a general problem but friends next to my room had service i had no tv for the last 3 days there the save deposit box in the room is $18 it should be free i 've been to about 7 different all inclusive hotels and by far this is the worst one it was cheap , i got what i paid for spend a few more hundred $ and go to barcelo babaro beach or riu palace punta cana 
i read reviews like this but did not listen you better do not waste your time and hard earned money in this dump the food stunk the drinks were so horrible that my friend and i went to the local grocery store to buy grey goose and stoly 's just so we could feel like we were drinking real alcohol and not alcohol flavored juice i asked for premiuim brand liquor and nobody had it and do not believe that if you go there and think if you tip good your gonna get it because you will not i went for about $700 00 in tips in one week just because i felt sorry for those poor fools and did not get any top shelf i got good service but i believe only because i gave a tip to everybody and their mother the food was horrible the activities were even worse they never tell you when there going to do something , especially for the kids my wife even told one of the people who was in charge of activities and they did nothing this place is not very kid friendly then they have these nights when they allow these vendors to come in and sell all kinds of junk to me it was one big beg - fest it was very annoying i 'm from new york i know about pan - handling that 's fine when your in the ghetto but not when you pay thousands of dollars to stay in a resort they should not allow those fools in the resort luckily i speak spanish , but if you do not your gonna have trouble getting your point across the people that spoke spanish got better service so if you do not pay attention to this review you deserve what you get 
we hated it having just returned from our most disappointing 2 weeks at the grand oasis resort i felt that i should warn other british holiday makers who may be thinking of going there avoid this place unless you speak spanish , otherwise you will be the last to get served at the bar or noticed by the waiting - on staff you can expect to order your drink two or three times before you actually get any service in windows buffet style restaurant the staff were rude and ignorant unless you flashed the cash infact i wondered whether the staff in the resort shop were infact mute you will need to be at the beach by 6am if you expect to reserve a parasol by placing your towels on the sun loungers we obviously relied on the shade of the palm trees , as we were on holiday and did not want to get up at the crack of dawn this holiday was far from relaxing my partner and i suffered sickness and diarhoea on more than 6 occasions from the poor food provided at this all - inclusive resort observing a rat running around inside aqua a la carte restaurant really was the final straw as far as eating was concerned we lived on boiled eggs and bananas after that experience ( the only safe options available ) and could not wait to return to england the other place you can expect to see live animals is around the pool and along the beach , where photographers use monkeys , parrots and iguanas as props to attract holiday makers to have their picture taken we found this disgraceful and were amazed it was deemed acceptable by the hotel our room was basic and the decor tired the towel rail came off the wall with the weight of a small hand towel and there was rust round the bathroom door hinges the maid service was really lacking we returned to find our room had not been cleaned eleven times during our fourteen night stay surely they had had enough times to service it between 8 30am and 5 we will definitely not be returning to this hotel or resort again infact , after this , our first impression of the dominican , we wil not be returning to the island the first time i have ever wanted to return home from a holiday it was terrible to say the least 
would not recommend to anyone the arrival was smooth , got to our rooms quickly and then the horror began we were with 6, 3 couples each in seperate rooms i think after 5 minutes in our rooms we were already back out asking each other if their room was just as bad in 1 room the airco did not work , the bed was broken in the others the door off the dressing closet fell off and in room nr 3 the door jammed so bad you had to force yourself to get inside bathrooms were very outdated and rust everywhere also in the block on the opposite side off the road they were upgrading the rooms so you could hear construction works going on all day complaining at the front desk did not work so the next day our travel agent had to arrange new rooms which luckely enough were not 20 years old in the restaurants the personnel hardly speaks english and the service is terrible mistakes in drinks ordered , tables not fully decked out so you had to take knives or forks from other tables to make yours complete asking for coffee resulted in a 10 minute wait which made you think they forgot if you arrived a bit late for breakfast a lot off tables were dirty so you had to scrape together clean stuff from different tables to make your own , the staff just did not know what to do , food on the floor was not picked up , we watched 9 waiters walk by a pizza on the floor before someone finally picked every 2 days a complete market was setup around the swimming pool with salesmen pulling your arms and really annoying you when you just wanted to get a drink from the bar bartenders were unfriendly and they just looked like they hated their job toilets beside the pool were horrible , in the men 's room from the 6 toilets 5 were just filled with fecies , like they were not cleaned in weeks we went to our rooms every time we needed to go it seems since the name changed from sunscape to grand oasis everything started to go wrong we just got home yesterday 29/07/2008 and i had the worst holiday in more then 10 years , money not wel spent 
a complete nightmare from the moment my husband and i walked into the lobby we knew our trip was going to be a nightmare first of all , the check in process was terrible , the staff at the front desk hardly spoke english and was unable to answer many of our questions to top it off , the lobby isnt air conditioned which makes matters 10 times worse when it 's already 100 degrees outside the rooms are terrible , we had to switch rooms twice cracked , dirty walls surrounded us , and besides our room smelling absolutely horrific , we were welcomed by spiders and ants which when we called to complain the staff offered to spray the room with pesticide being 4 months pregant i dont think that would have been such a smart idea the second room was slightly better , being that it was on the 3rd floor rather than the 1st , it smelled better and was insect free however , the ceiling was made out of wood with big cracks , so who knows how insect free it truely is showering is another issue the water comes and goes and to top it off it stinks so you get out smelling worse than when you go in the beds are completely uncomfortable , no box spring , just a mattress on a wooden platform oh , and dont bother calling for wake up calls the outside grounds are pretty and kept very clean the pools are ok also , only 4ft deep though the food is completely disgusting the flies however dont seem to think so making reservations for the restaurants was a disaster unless you spoke spanish , then that 's when they had whatever time you rquested on the whole , our 5 days in punta cana were a nightmare starting with the disappointing 5- star hotel and ending with each one of us getting horrible stomach viruses because of the food/drinks this was definitely an experience i will never forget the list of problems could go on and on , but i think by now you get the hint stay away from this place 
what a nightmare we just returned from are stay food was just ok , we staying a suite - smelly though okthe good : the pool , the scene , go quads ( a bit far on a rickity bus ) , go see the sting ray - fantastic bad : many venders forceing themselfs on you on the resort the cleaners do not come all the time - when they come its 7pm , when we 're geytting ready for the evening entertainment is hard workbe prepared to get ripped off by the casino would i recommend this hotel to my best friend i do not recommend this hotel for : an amazing honeymoon , a romantic getaway , girlfriend getaway , families with young children , families with teenagers , tourists i selected this hotel as a top choice for : beach / sun 
beautiful resort , ugly service let me preface this review by saying that we won this trip in a contest we would never choose an all - inclusive type of resort because we value quality over quantity the front desk service was extremely inept we were forced to wear these ridiculous yellow wrist bands for the entire week when i asked why we had to wear them , edgar , the front desk clerk , asked us if we wanted to eat or not how tacky and rude edgar continued to be rude to us throughout our entire stay the maid service was deplorable at grand oasis , the maids must not follow the rule that towels that are hanging up should be left alone and towels that are on the floor should be taken away we were constantly without towels the maid removed all our towels ( clean and dirty ) every morning , leaving us with none until next morning we had to beg the front desk for clean towels every day by the third day , i was forced to lock up clean towels in my suitcase so they would not be taken away our safe did not work , so we were forced to lock our valuables in a suitcase the resort is loud there is a constant , steady stream of techno music piped throughout the lobby , all common areas , pools , restaurants , bars , bathrooms , even on the beach the music is loud and grates on the nerves after a while the watersports activity center was by far the worst aspect of this resort rude , apathetic staff ruined our snorkling trip we paid 40 dollars us to go snorkling about a half mile off - shore we asked about snorkling gear before we got on the boat monica , who worked at the watersports building , dismissively waved her hand toward the boat , indicating that gear was available once we boarded there was no gear we asked about the gear again when we reached the dive boat , and got a no english response we were stranded on the boat with no gear the boat operator found a dirty mask laying on the bottom of the boat and offered it to me um , no thanks we asked for a refund and were met with attitude instead finally , the manager gave us our money back , but only after 20 minutes of haggling no apologies were given for our wasted time we were constantly bothered by vacation club reps on the resort , trying to get us to buy a vacation club through oasis resorts we were hounded by these vacation club reps every they are staked out all around the pools and outside every restaurant a simple no , thanks was not enough they even insulted us after we told them we were not interested for the last time by telling we were cheapskates for not snapping up such a good offer bottom line is this : go to grand oasis punta cana if you want to be treated poorly by apathetic , unfriendly staff i was happy to leave that place 
horrible do not stay here checked in on 4/12/07 and the air conditioning was leaking from the ceiling onto the tile floor , the ceiling tiles were falling down , the light in the shower did not work and the room smelled i went to the reception desk three times and each time i was told a maintenance worker was on the way to fix the problems this never happened i went to see the apple vacations representative and was told that wei could not have a new room until the next day and we would have to spend the night in this room we had to leave the room by 10:00 in the morning and the new room was ready for until after 12:00 on 4/12/07 we made reservations with the concieger for dinner for two of the nights we were staying , when we went to the restaurant for dinner we were told that our reservation was for the following night and not that evening the conceiger made us two dinners reservation for saturday night and nothing for friday night the restaurant was full and could not seat us but suggested that we check with the other restaurants to see if any of them had a cancellation and might be able to fit us in we were able to eat at the italian restaurant one night there was a beach party and the food was horrible and the bugs were really that night this is definetly not a 5 star resort do not waste your money at this place 
the worst vacation ever this was by far the worst vacation i have ever been on if we are not able to get our money back , the very least we can do is prevent anyone else from making the same mistake we did by going to this resort as two young adults looking for a great value on a vacation we were not expecting the ritz by any means , however the grand oasis was simply unacceptable not a single thing was as advertised and it was a disaster from the moment we stepped on to the property we were moved from our room several times then placed in an upgraded room in the new building we had no hot water , no air conditioning , the ceiling fan did not work and neither did the fridge the toilet ran and leaked 24 hours a day the excess moisture attracted flies , which infested our room the staff at the hotel all but refused to help us in any way , shape or form the restaurants were absolutely abhorrent rats were running around the windows eating area every night we went in there it was no surprise when my boyfriend contracted a horrible case of food poisoning from the mush and scraps they offer to their patrons as meals they use bottom shelf liquor in all their drinks , which are very watered down the rental equipment is all dingy and out dated - not to mention impossible to try and reserve there are way too many people therefore impossible to get a chair by the beach or the pool i could go on however i chose not to re - live the worst vacation of my life please , take my word and book another resort , i promise you will thank me 
one big problem turned into more we (2 couples in our 30s without children ) stayed at the grand oasis punta cana from january 19th to january 26th 2008 to give anyone perspective on our benchmarks we have stayed and enjoyed them all : punta cana ( dr ) - iberostar bavaro - caribe club princesspuerto plata ( dr ) - bahia principemayan riviera ( mx ) - riu playacar - bahia principe tulumso , about the grand oasis punta cana / bavaro we were booked for the grand oasis bavaro - junior suites cameleon package this building was not ready ( under construction ) so we were put in a master junior suite rooms in the grand oasis punta cana - block 7 grand oasis bavaro and punta cana are the same resort just the bavaro is the name for the newest building - block 11 the room (7304) was outstanding - by far the best we 've stayed in on any of our vacations in the caribbean however , the air conditioning for the entire building ( block 7) did not work for our entire stay you may wonder why we did not ask for a room change , and that was because we were told it would be fixed ( over and over by the resort , by our tour rep and every other guest in the block - we all kept getting assured it would be fixed that day ) additionally , our building was the only one with the junior suites and the rooms in the rest of the resort are a little below average for the caribbean ( very worn ) in any event , not getting sleep 'cause your room is 35 degrees ( celcius ) or more all night can make people grumpy and tired we did not have the energy to go on any excursions so we slept in the shade a lot during the day and then sweat all night it can also make you see everything with a little glass is half empty point of view so i wo not share any more thoughts on the resort because i do not have much positive to say and , because we really wanted to see a resort map before we went but could not find any online , i 've enclosed a copy for reference building 7 has no air conditioning but the rooms are great ( there are some traveller photos of them ) i wrote on the map where building 11 is and this is where anyone booked to stay at the grand oasis bavaro will be staying once the construction is complete 
neither grand nor an oasis we (3kids  wife ) rented 2 rooms over christmas/new years break wife and i stayed in the suites for $50 extra per day we had no ac the entire week and they would not give us a different room even if we took a downgrade kept telling us it was going to be fixed then on the 3rd day told us it was a hotel wide problem but our kid?? room had ac the entire time frig did not work ( warm beer - yeah ) and when we went to get ice - no ice machines , had to walk all the way down to the bar (200 yds away ) could not get a beach towel or seat at the beach for the 1st 2 days sorry we??e really busy? that was the standard reply anytime you ask for something from staff they allow merchants to set up inside the hotel grounds so every time you walked to a meal or the pools someone was trying to sell you a timeshare or carved coconut , very annoying if you??e like me and need the shade , it was very limited unless you wanted to get up at 6:30 and do the towel save move and they had no umbrella?? to use or rent hotel was understaffed , not doubt i didn?? see staff sitting around , those who we saw were running and hustling , just did not have nearly enough most breakfast meals you had to find someone to get you coffee only to get blown off and had to get it your self all - inclusive was weak no bottled water , no bottle or cans of beer ? everything was served in small 10oz plastic cups , didn?? matter what you ordered couple of stations were you could get self - serve water or soda?? rarely had cups ( understaffed problem ) so you had to go to one of only 3 bars for the entire hotel and wait in line we used apple vacations who were of no help with our room situation , beach towels and other problems , they were only interested in booking our excursions which it turns out we could have done on our own for less the weather and beach were awesome we went on 2 excursions that were great , saw some nice spots and had a good time once i let go of the poor choice we made with the hotel we talked to other folks during our excursions and they had much better experiences with their hotels , wouldn?? give up on punta cana just the weaky - joe hotel improperly call grand oasis , should have been called the grand mirage? 
hated this resort we are a family of 5 my husband and i with 3 children ( one of them being disabled ) we stayed at this resort from june 23-30, 2007 our room was ok , but there were times where we did not have any hot water each time we had contacted the service desk to advise them , they would respond with an attitude most of the staff working in this resort looked as if they were not happy and therefore this reflected tremendously on the service the food was terrible we were all sick and i ended up in the hosiptal ( only to beg the doctor to discharge me early due to my three children ) the hotel claimed that no one else has been sick and therefore it was our imagination our rep suggested that we only eat bread for the week ( nice suggestion ) the hotel was well aware of my hospital stay as an ambulance had to pick me up from the hotel because the doctor 's office was not equipped to handle my bacterial infection no one from the hotel contacted us to see how we were doing , in actual fact they treated us as if we were garbage now the kids club what kids club my children who are very active and love to swim , play sports and interact with other children did not want to go to the kids club also the kids show at night again what kids show every night they sang the same songs in a circle and that was that it broke my heart to see my children not having fun as they should have every two years we go away with the children having to travel as a family of five is not cheap especially when it takes us two years of putting away money little by little in order to enjoy a week vacation i was very disappointed in this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone unless you are young going with a bunch of girls or guys they seem to like those types of travelers i have lived in the dr and have travelled to the dr over 15 times but never have i been treated so poorly as i did here i ignored some of the posting on the site warning us but figured these people must have been too picky i now realize that there are some hotels in the dr that are just not worth it

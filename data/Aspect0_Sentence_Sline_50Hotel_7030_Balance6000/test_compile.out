		they messed up our add - ons , but apologized i 'm writing this to help other tripadvisor users , not to grind any particular ax .
		0
		i recommend not ordering any additional items through the hotel 's website , or if you do , call ahead to make sure they are following through . my wife and i were staying at the casablanca for our tenth wedding anniversary , which the hotel knew .
		4
		when i booked our stay , i ordered ( as a surprise to my wife ) add - ons that the hotel offers on its website : a bottle of champagne , a bottle of red wine , and flowers to be waiting in our room for our arrival .
		0
		the total price of the add - ons was about $150. the items were a no - show .
		2
		they apologized when i pointed out the omission , and offered to make the champagne complimentary and deliver the flowers the next day . we ended up cancelling our stay , so i wo not comment on the hotel other than to say that everything else seemed very nice , the location is fantastic for times square access , and the staff and management were genuinely upset that they had made the mistake , apologizing many times .
		4
		they tried to make it right , and graciously agreed to cancel our reservation . i believe that the casablanca hotel probably deserves all the great reviews it gets on tripadvisor and i do not discourage anyone from booking this hotel ( except the add - ons ) .

		0
		based on a previous review and our own recent experience , it appears this hotel regularly overbooks .
		0
		what made this especially galling is that we had received a phone call from the casablanca management the day before we arrived , to confirm that we would be coming for a four - night stay (3/27/04-3/31/04) .
		0
		yet when we showed up at 5:00 pm to check in , we were told we did not have a room and fed a ridiculous and obviously invented story about a roof leak causing our room to be unavailable .

		4
		talk about inconvenient .
		3
		in any case we loved the royalton and decided to stay there for our entire stay , even though we had to pay substantially more for the last two nights .
		0
		everything about the relocation made the trip much more expensive .
		3
		for instance , the casablanca includes free continental breakfast and free afternoon wine and snacks , while the hotel they substituted charges $21 for continental breakfast and a minimum of $10 for a glass of wine .
		4
		also , the casablanca has free high - speed internet access , while the substituted hotel charges $10 a night .

		had we been on a tight budget , this experience would have been absolutely infuriating .

		for the birds we knew what we were getting into by selecting a hotel with no ac - but after looking at the average temperatures for sf - we thought we would be ok .
		3
		so selecting the chancellor was our choice and this review is not really about the heat .
		4
		we were in sf during the recent heat wave - it was very hot and miserable to sleep at the chancellor as we had a front room , the window had no screens ( there were crows on the balcony - not exactly something you want to wake up to ) so our room had no air flow .
		1
		it was so helpful ( not ) that they offered us electric fans as we checked out - in that heat situation - those should have been offered to all guests .
		0
		the room was a good 20 degrees warmer than the outside temperature .
		0
		so - if you happen to go during extreme heat - ask for a room in the back and the extra fan . as for the room , it was very small and while updated in its decor - it was old .
		0
		the bathroom was also very small ( the door barely clears the toilet ) with no frills .
		0
		i would have no problem with this - but it also was not very clean .

		outrageous ! before going to the ritz in san juan i had read both the good and the bad reviews .

		1
		my college roomate and i were staying at the ritz for 3 nights to celebrate our 30th birthdays .
		4
		over the course of our short stay , we thought the service at the club level lounge was great , had no problem with the pool attendants and thought the spa was fantastic . but the service at the front tesk was so terrible that it ruined our entire stay .
		2
		1. check - in - yikes !
		1
		if the hotel is full - as it was during our entire stay - there is always a long line and the rooms are never ready on time .
		4
		not a big deal , but the problem is that they are rude to guests as they tell them their room is not available .
		0
		example - when they told me our room would be ready in an hour and i asked what time it was ( as i did not have a watch on ) , the person at the front desk sighed , showed me her wrist and said with a lot of attititude - i do not have a watch .
		0
		there was a clock behind her and she was at a computer which i assume had the time on it .
		4
		also , i had requested via e - mail and confirmed by phone a room with 2 double beds on the club level , and when we checked in it was obvious that they had given all those rooms away .
		0
		rather than apologizing for their inability to honor the reservation , they said they had a record of my request , but no record that that my request had ever been confirmed - . . .huh ?
		0
		when i said that i had called a few days before to double check on my request for double beds , they insinuated that i was lying by stating that they had no record of the call ever having taken place .
		0
		i can understand that things fall through the cracks when it 's busy , but that 's when you apologize and try to fix things , do not accuse the guest of lying !
		0
		i got so personally offended and upset i asked to speak to a manager ( which i never do ! ) .
		1
		the front desk manager did not apologize for the unprofessional manner of the front desk clerk - she simply said , well , we have no record that you ever called so i have no choice but to give both of you the benefit of the doubt . . . i 'm sorry but we have no proof that the call ver took place .
		0
		wow , so much for 5- star customer service .

		they ended up placing us on on a non - club floor but gave us access to the club lounge through an additional key - no big deal .
		1
		however when we called to request the complimentary in - room coffee service given to club guests , they said that we did not have club privileges .
		0
		i explained that we did have privileges even though we were staying on a different floor , and could he check in the computer to verify ?
		4
		the person said , no you do not have privileges and angrily hung up on me ! seriously , hung up ! - who hangs up on people in a hotel ?
		0
		i mean c 'mon , it 's not that hard to call back - they are the front desk !
		0
		i later learned that the system was down , and therefore the person i spoke with was unable to look us up on the computer and because i was calling from a non - club floor , he assumed i was not a club guest .
		1
		but then why did not he explain that the system was down , and they were unable to confirm my status ?
		1
		note : when i called later and learned what had happened - no apology - they never apologize , sometimes explain why they are rude - but rarely an apology .
		1
		there were many other outrageous experiences/run ins with the front desk - but i think these give a pretty good picture .
		2
		one final example was our wake up call the day we left .
		0
		i called the night before and asked for a 8am wake up call with coffee .
		0
		they called ( and delivered the coffee ) at 6am .
		2
		since i 'm not a morning person i did not realize that they called 2 hours early until i had my coffee , took a shower and then looked at the clock .
		0
		so i decided to go back to sleep and called back down to make sure that they would still call us at 8. the person who answered said rudely yes , we already have it in our computer , an 8am wake up call .
		4
		i said back pretty sharply at this point , why do you think i 'm awake right now with a cup of coffee ?
		4
		they already called at 6. silence , then no apology , just we 'll call at 8 - click .

		do not go at a time when it 's full .

		way overpriced , not worth it at all !
		1
		the grounds and property at the el conquistador were very impressive .
		1
		i heard it was formerly some type of university .
		1
		the absence of a beach concerned me , but the shuttle to the private island worked well , and we really enjoyed our time out there .
		3
		in many ways i felt like the prices were a rip off .
		1
		the hotel campus is quite large and remote , and so you have very limited choices when leaving the campus .
		4
		since they know you are largely a captive audience , they really stick it too you .

		every meal is 5 times what it should be .

		there was a star bucks in the middle of the lobby , and the prices there seemed cheap !
		1
		the rooms are not well insulated for sound , as it was not originally built as a hotel .
		4
		we had noisy partying drinking neighbors for two nights , so we got no sleep for that time .
		2
		they kept giving you the heavy sale on bottled water at 8 dollars a glass .
		4
		i just felt like it was a constant attempt to extract money from us .
		1
		it really ruined our vacation .
		0
		the cream of the rip off was the shuttle service from the airport .
		1
		most hotels are so glad to have you , they give you free shuttle service to and from the hotel .

		we were charged 832 dollars for our group of 14 on the day we check out .
		1
		nice surprise .
		3
		it would be one thing if they warned you or mentioned it anywhere , but no , they left he surprise for the last day .
		0
		the bus that brought us there had a terrible mildew smell inside , and the video system broke down that was to give us orientation to the island , then the transmission went out , and we had to go 1 mile per hour for the last 1/4 mile .
		0
		it almost did not make it up the hill to the lobby to unload us .
		1
		the staff at the hotel was very mediocre .
		0
		i would never come to this place again , even if it were free .

		it is a beautiful place with so much potential , but they are so greedy to rip you off , it just ruins the whole vacation .

		not the same i recently stayed at the las casitas in the el conquistador during the tail end of my honeymoon .
		3
		we came off a beautiful cruise to the southern caribbean with royal caribbean and thought what better time to visit the beautiful el conquistador .
		1
		i had stayed here approximately 3 years ago and loved the entire experience .
		1
		this experience , however , left much to be desired . i booked a 1 bedroom villa in the las casitas .
		1
		when we arrived , the room had not been cleaned .

		the refuse laid on the front landing .
		2
		additionally , we paid $500.00 for a oceanview .

		when we called the concierge , they did not seem surprised . overall , the resort has beautiful property , but the el conquistador seemed to be open to the public as a day resort which made for crowded pools and a not so luxorious las casitas .
		1
		it was very disappointing because we loved it so much on our previous visit .
		2
		i was relieved that when we boarded the shuttle bus to the airport an older couple echoed the same sentiments about this disappointing visit .

		additionally , they informed us that they paid $280.00 per night for the same room .

		3
		do not stay there !
		0
		yes , for the most part , the negative reviews posted on trip advisor are true . the bellman summed it up very simply , nothing is free at this hotel except the air .
		2
		they charge you for everything , parking , tennis , the gym , etc .
		2
		in addition to that , everything is expensive .
		0
		bottled water is $6.00, a simple greek salad ( very small ) is $19.00, and dinner for 2 at the italian restaurant ran us $180.00.
		1
		we found the food in the restaurants to be mediocre at best .
		0
		after our $180 experience we started eating off the property .
		1
		there are many very good restaurants in the area . although the boat ride to the beach is fun , it only ran every half hour at best .

		so many flaws , i started keeping a list if ever there were a hotel in need of a complete makeover from top to bottom , it is the el conquistador .
		1
		as another poster put it , this resort is way past its prime .
		2
		it 's a good thing they 're remodeling .
		1
		very few things were noticably good .
		3
		lots were bad .
		1
		here is my list , starting with the good : my main complaint was the food and drink prices .
		1
		i guess when you go to a resort , you are taking yourself out of the free market where competition drives prices down and you kind of expect it .
		3
		but at the el con , they 've gone mad .
		0
		a 2- person meal with wine was well over $100 ( at all restaurants - - there were no bargain places ) .
		1
		small drinks by the pool and private island were $8 each .
		1
		there was no escape other than to purchase an over - priced bottle of liquor or wine and make your own drinks .
		1
		good luck doing that on the beach ( the only one is on the private island ) .
		1
		we attempted to order pizza from dominoes and pizza hut , but they said that el con security prevents delivery .
		3
		breakfast was $25 each . . . does that give you an idea of how bad this place was ?
		0
		as for the room , there were chips and stains all over including couch , lampshades , walls , floors , etc .
		0
		it was small and there was mildew in shower .
		0
		tv and _jambox_ ( circa 1995) were awful .
		1
		on one particular outing to find ice , i found that the 5th floor ice machine was broken . . . as was the one on the 4th floor .
		4
		finally i found ice on the third floor but could not help but notice that the stairwell light was out ( and dangerous ) and all three ice machines were completely different .
		1
		a nitpick ? yes .
		3
		but this is supposed to be a 5- star resort . when trying to rent a car one night ( to get the hell out of there ) we found that the car rental guy had skipped out 15 minutes early . . . dooming us to another night trapped at the resort .
		0
		we later found out all rentals had to be 24 hours and were at least $80 for an economy . . . not worth it . the service was not really too bad except for an incident where we waited 30-45 minutes for a corkscrew and two wine glasses ( after asking two separate workers ) and finally i had to go get them myself from a bar near the casino .
		4
		took me 5 minutes . there was no wireless internet which , for a technophile like myself , was a major pain .
		0
		there was wired internet in the hotel room , but that prevented sitting on the balcony with my laptop .
		0
		internet was $15 per day . the gift shops were overpriced and pretty crappy .
		1
		most of them looked like mostly empty shelves with a few dusty , random items placed on the shelves .
		1
		on two separate occassions , i noticed that the cigar humidor doors were sitting wide open which dries out the cigars .
		2
		bring your own . the activities were there , but all expensive .
		0
		frankly , i did not trust the hotel enough to provide me with a good value for the money , so i cancelled a scuba diving session .
		2
		the private island was cool , i guess , and the ferries over there were prompt and fast ( a recent improvement , i learned ) .
		2
		however , the horseback riders went by at one point and i noticed . . . they were not on the beach and they were walking slowly in a controlled single - file line .
		1
		if you think you 're going to ride a horse freely on the beach , forget it .
		3
		also , the beach was nasty with seaweed and jagged coral and rocks pretty much anywhere you attempted to walk .
		1
		hardly anybody was in the water . the casino was small and had no texas hold - em poker .
		3
		just mindless games of chance . all the gift shops and restaurants took paper records of all purchases .
		2
		what was the point of the swipable card they gave us if not to charge things to the room ?
		0
		by the way , the cards had our names printed in black on a black background , so all the waiters and service people had to ask my last name .
		0
		again , a nitpick , but a further demonstration of the lack of attention to detail .
		2
		when you added them all up , they got annoying when you 're supposed to be having a good time . the final straw of this place 's suckiness was the unexpected $132 charge for two people for shuttle service to and from the airport .
		0
		there 's nothing worse i hate than completely unexplained , unanticipated charges , especially ones that are an obvious money - grab . the best part of the resort was the infinity pool which is , technically , off limits to el con guests .
		0
		it 's for the las casitas people only ( the golf villas on site ) .
		3
		but as you 'd expect from the el con staff , nobody cared or noticed that we just walked right in .
		2
		that was the only part that was actually good . the bottom line is , by choosing this resort , you are submitting to the price gouging and crappiness .
		0
		my travelling companion and i both agreed that puerto rico is probably best done in a 5 star hotel near san juan .
		0
		that way , the competitive forces of being able to walk down the street to a twice - as - nice , half - as - expensive steakhouse ( not to mention other things like rainforest tours , scuba , etc ) start to have a positive effect . avoid the el con at all costs .

		0
		to begin , our company provided us with some cash upon arrrival for use during the week .

		beware of this property first and worst is the theft ring that works the property from the inside , while the resort claims this is not a usual problem . . the more we investigate the more we find this is very much the norm , even rampant there and we have only been checking into this for a few hours since we returned .

		1
		there are no vegetables and you would think that fruit would be a big part of a tropical island but to my surprise they were stingy with the fruits and vegies all over the island .
		0
		the el conquistador has no real representation of latin food so the puerto rican experience is non - existant here .
		1
		we left the compound to get that . the beach was tiny and you have to go to palomino island to get to it , they have reggaeton music blareing through a bad sound system the whole time so you cant enjoy the sound of the ocean .
		0
		( it 's also at poolside too , but that is a party atmosphere ) the cocktail service at the beach was served to us by people who would rather be anywhere else , and usually were . the staff at the entrance of the hotel ( bellmen , valet etc . . were very nice until our exit ) you are held captive unless you want to rent a car at 100.00 a day to start .
		3
		they told us not to go anywhere unless you take one of thier tours due to unsafe conditions around the island .

		a nightmare vacation my husband an i and my parents arrived there very excited , my husband was there for the medical symposium conference . we checked in to a nightmare of a room , my parents an i were given adjoining rooms , mine was a room for the handicapped , which only had a shower .
		0
		we had no air conditioner for the first three days we were there on the second day i let housekeeping know that the room was very hot and humid making our clothes and our bedsheets very moist and musty , it was so humid on the second night i actually had an asthma attack , i went down to the front desk and it took them till the third day to fix the problem . the worst part was the shower , since it was a room for the handicapped it had an open shower which allowed the water to flood the bathroom everytime you tried to shower it got so bad that the water was actually seeping out in to the hallway , making it a very dangerous situation .
		0
		again i told housekeeping and the only thing i got was a bunch of rolled up towels along the floor to soak up water again they never reported the problem .
		4
		on the third day i slipped and fell injurying my right knee when i hit the floor , also the water reached the closet in the bathroom and all our shoes were soaking wet the maid helped me put them out on the balcony to dryi was in tears .
		0
		at that point i went to the front desk to complain only to be given the run around , it took 25 min of waiting before anyone would actually come out to speak with me , i would think that if someone got hurt at a major hotel someone would be out in 2 seconds to handle the problem , well i lost it and demanded to speak with the hotel manager , which by the way we never saw , they sent the room director who basically said they did not have another room to give us at that time , and who never reported the fall i took in the bathroom no incident report was ever filed by mr angelo perez .

		he did offer us a complimentary dinner at what he said was their best restaurant , to which we were told we would have to pay for our own drinks , at the restaurant we were seated at a table in a corner near the kitchen , making us feel like bad children , it was a lackluster meal at best and we felt like we were being punished .
		0
		my husband conveyed this entiment to the room director on feb 11th , he called us back and said that they wanted to move us to one of the casitas , in their haste they deactivated our room keys with all our things still in our rooms , i lost it and went back to the front desk and told them to let us back in our rooms and that with 2 days left in our stay we would not be moving there really was no point .
		1
		on feb 12th mr perez ask my husband to meet with him , we were offered a 1000.00
		4
		refund for our trouble and 2 free nights , only to find out that out of the 1000.00
		4
		credit they were deducting the 2 free nights and the complimentary dinner they had given us on friday night , when i asked about that the response i got was well we have to pay the restaurant for the meal somehow , it was awful .
		0
		they also over charged us for the transfer from the airport to the hotel which they had to review and take off and . the fact that i fell in their hotel bathroom , or had an asthma attack directly related to the hot , humid room or that i had to wear wet shoes to the so - called complimentary dinner and the attitude we recieved from the staff , seem to have no effect on them at all .
		0
		it was shameful and humiliating for us , my expierience at this hotel will never be forgotten , but the worst part is that in beingan ocuupational therapist and my husband a physician we made it clear that if that bathroom was a hazard for us imagine how dangerous it would be for truly physically disabled person , to which the response was what would you like us to do ? if you plan to stay there , make sure you are told everything , the hidden housekeeping charge of 3.00 per day the charge for the bellman as well as a resort tariff , whatever that is .
		0
		the rooms were dusty and dirty , plates removed from our room were left in front of our door all day with flies buzzing around it was disgusting i had to finally take the plates away myself and put them in the ice room , also the ice machines on our floor were broken , and the worst was having to push dirty wet towels around on the floor used to soak up the water on the bathroom floor after showers , they did send up someone to unclog the drain , but the water still flooded the floor , so we resorted to taking showers in my parents room , which had a tub .

		the food is very expensive and and not very good at all , which we elected to eat outside of the hotel . it was an awful hotel and made for a very bad vacation , so i caution anyone before choosing this place .

		i arrived without a reservation , yet despite being a whyndam by request ember ( which is their version of a priority guest ) , despite the fact that the hotel advertised a web price of $228, the hotel would not honor this , even after confirming that i was correct , they stuck fastidiously to their walk in rate of $269.

		the hotel lacks atmosphere , there is absolutely nothing to do for kids and teenagers after dark , nor adults for that matter . having been to the very expensive paradise island and loving it , i feel at least there you get great service , great food , incredible beaches , dozens of water rides , excellent restaurants , great entertainment and innumerable things to do . alternatively south florida has a myriad of superior beaches , with better hotel choices , standards and prices than the rio .

		service nightmare the other reviews here comment on how nice the hotel can be - here is our experience ( as a gold tier starwood preferred guest . )on the positive side , our family enjoyed the beach . on the negative side , here is the list : - 45 minutes to check in using the special starwood preferred guest line ( the regular guest line , although much longer , moved more quickly - go figure . . . ) - while waiting , the bell staff stored our luggage ( without advising us ) with five pieces and only one claim check , we had to go to the luggage room to identify our bags .

		- no hangers in the room ( this was a personal first after traveling extensively for over 30 years . ) - awakened at 9:00am by jack - hammering and drilling .

		the wing of the hotel had apparently been scheduled for 3-4 days of construction ( exactly coinciding with our stay . )

		on our third phone call to the desk , we finally got someone to change our room . the hotel has a great location , and is a good facility ( certainly not great , and not up to typical westin standards ) , but the service was really bad - everything we experienced could have been easily avoided by a management team that was thinking about the guest experience .

		what did not go wrong during our family stay at this resort . . check - in was a nightmare , our room was smokey , smelly  disgusting ( not good when you have a 11 month old baby  a 10 year old child ) .
		0
		the resort was so huge that they had portable trains to transport everyone from one end of the resort to the other which is a good thing but ( yes ! there is a but ) they were constantly braking down  on a hot  humid day this is not good especially when your dealing with an infant !
		0
		this resort is not cut out for families with specific needs meaning reasonable walking distance to all the resturants , shops , spa 's , pools  entertainment/show areas ( believe us when we tell you this was not the case ) .

		after spending the week of christmas with our entire extended family at the paradisus , we found the resort grounds beautiful and well manicured , and we found the staff to be friendly , if a bit slow .
		1
		check - in was truly painful and slow , taking well over an hour even though everything had been prepaid .
		2
		we 're fairly patient people , but it was unreasonablly unorganized considered we had been scheduled months in advance .

		one thing that cannot be overstated is the extremely low quality of much of the food .

		other cuts our party ordered were of equally low quality with the expection of the tenderloin which was good . we had a special anniversary meal planned the the japanese restaurant , which required reservations .

		of course , the reservation was recorded for the wrong evening and # of people , so we did not get to celebrate the special day as a family , or on the right day . beware of checkout : the maids reported that one room in our party had hidden a guest in their room , so they charged us for an extra person .

		of course , this was not true .

		1
		pluses - nice beach with beautiful white sand , nicely decorated and trimmed property , the pool is great , with a swim - up bar .
		1
		dinners in restaurants are ok , the mediterranean and french restaurants are very decentminuses - personnel is trying to be friendly , but they are very sloppy .
		0
		for example , there was the housekeeper 's or previous guests ' hair all over the floor in our suite .
		1
		so , my wife had to do extra cleaning herself .
		0
		also , the personnel are not fluent in english . buffet is open only for breakfast , poor choice of tasteless food .
		1
		lunch in the restaurant by the beach is not bad , but same dishes every day .
		1
		one day , my wife found a rubber band in her food at this restaurant !
		3
		the main reason we chose this hotel was the all - inclusive activities , such as scuba diving .
		0
		howvever , because of the constant waves ( and as we found out later , there are huge waves at this particular place of punta cana because of its location ) , i could not do any scuba diving .
		0
		so , we had to book a separate trip to catalina island in the caribbean sea ( near la romana ) , where i did scuba diving , and my family enjoyed snorkeling , both for extra charge , obviously .
		0
		we did not feel safe at the beach , especially for our little daughter , because there are a lot of strangers there roaming around trying to sell you smth or sign you up for smth .
		0
		the nightly entertainment shows are very poor and of low quality . we also had problems with our keys , twice .
		0
		when we tried using them to open the door to our room , they did not work .
		0
		and mind it - because of the huge hotel territory , it takes you 15 minutes to get to the lobby to fix them . another thing - there is no alcohol in your room 's bar , and the choice of alcoholic beverages on the hotel 's property is very poor .
		3
		one more thing - they are trying to promote the reserve area of this hotel by booking you on a 90- minute tour ( which in reality took three hours ) , with the purpose of making you sign up for some kind of a timeshare .
		0
		our concierge said that if we attend the tour , we will get a one week of free stay at the reserve , valid for the next two years .
		2
		so , we attended this three hour tour and totally wasted our time , and the people were puttting a lot of pressure on us trying to make us sign up for this program .
		0
		we refused at the end , and guess what ?
		0
		they did not offer us any free stay at the reserve !
		1
		( and the concierge later said that they recently discontinued doing so ) .

		so , we really very much regretted wasting our precious vacation time on this . here is our advice - stay away from this particular place , it is not worth your money , it is such a dissapointment .

		the next room had 2 double beds , which were so rickety that whenever my husband rolled over in bed it creaked so loudly that it woke me up .

		the next room they gave us had such a musty smell and so many flies in the room .

		firstly , eat a huge breakfast .
		4
		this is the only passable meal of the day .

		if you want a decent dinner , you need to make reservations which you cannot do until you actually arrive at the resort , at which time they have nothing available .

		when we finally did get a rservation ( and it was only because someone was nice enough to give us theirs that they were not using ) it was at the french restaurant that was awful .

		2
		of course , it did not .
		0
		and the snorkling trip they provide is mediocre , at best .
		1
		the equipment is passed on from one group to another without even cleaning the snorkles !
		2
		my husband is an early riser , but even he was not early enough because by 7:30 am all the shaded bali beds were taken .

		we realized that people were putting towels on chairs the night before , and thus we had to do the same in order to have chairs on the beach .

		during those 4 hours , no one suggested that there was a room availability problem .

		the manager told us that it was our problem and there was nothing he could do but put us up at the bavaro princess .
		0
		we reluctantly went there , as we had no choice .

		not what expected for the price the dominican republic is a beautiful country to visit , however the paradisus needs to make some adjustments before i ever go back .
		1
		the resort itself is not the problem .
		1
		it is the royal service that the club offers .
		2
		it is way overrated .
		2
		you do not get what you pay for .
		2
		we never heard from our butler except for the first day that we arrived .
		1
		all our information about the area came from an employee that we ran into in the front lobby named miguel .
		2
		this is what the butler was supposed to do .
		1
		if it had not been for him , we would not have known which restuarants to eat in and what time you could even go there .
		1
		the times we called for our butler he never called back or they would tell us he was not there .
		0
		we never spoke to him beyond the first day .
		0
		they also tell you that when you have royal service you can call them for room service .
		0
		this is a joke .
		0
		every time we called vip , we were told to call room service .
		0
		we also had to stay on the fartherest side of the resort .
		1
		the private beach area was on the opposite side .
		1
		we found that it was easier to stay on the side that our room was on .
		3
		the reason for this is because the resort is in the process of building the private pool for vip .
		1
		this meant that they had the area blocked off that lead to the private beach .
		0
		you had to then walk the long way around and then go back to the beach area .
		1
		we did go to the private beach area once needless to say we did not go back for the above reason but also because the service you get is nonexistant .
		1
		they came around once and asked us what we wanted to drink .
		1
		plus anyone had access to this beach .
		1
		the only difference between the two beach areas were the chairs in the private beach area were more comfortable .
		3
		overall the beach was clean and well kept .
		1
		the reservations that are made for you at the restuarants , you can make yourself .
		0
		you do not need them to make this for you . our butler also did not inform us about the pillow menu .
		1
		we did not find the form for this until 10 minutes before check out .
		4
		also we were not told anywhere by anyone that if you make a credit card call or a calling card call from your room , you will be charged 60 pesos per call for a connection fee .
		1
		this can add up in a hurry especially when you are unaware of this charge .
		2
		by the way , if anyone has horseback riding experience , i recommend skipping this part of the excursions that are included in the price .
		0
		the reason is because if you have any experience you will find the excursion lacking .
		1
		most , except for about 2, of the horses are nags and in very poor condition .
		3
		they never get beyond the back - beating trot .
		4
		i have rode horses for 30 years and this was the most excurciating experience of my life .
		3
		my horse liked to have beat me to death and they are like a bunch of pack mules .
		2
		we also had to go to several other resorts to pick up people to go riding also .
		0
		our trip was supposed to take 1 hour and it ended up taking 3 hours .
		1
		i would also like to tell anyone not to use future vacations who uses club caribe as their representative .
		1
		we were 4 women , who does not speak any spanish , traveling alone and nobody showed up at the airport to pick us up .
		0
		this was a little nerve racking .
		1
		they never were at the hotel when they were supposed to be .
		0
		we never seen our representative with club caribe except for the day after we arrived and was told that he would take care of everything .
		0
		we called him every day thereafter and he never showed up to meet with us like he scheduled .
		0
		we were not able to book any excursions nor do any activities trying to meet up with him to confirm our flight .
		0
		for example , we had an excursion for snorkeling that is included in the price scheduled for saturday and our representative said that he could meet with us between 10:30 am and 11:30 am , so we cancelled our snorkeling trip ( which was our last day ) to meet with this person and he never showed .
		0
		the night before we left he told us on the phone that we just needed to take a taxi .
		0
		we had the resort call for a taxi and we arrived at the airport on time .

		we were at paradisus punta cana from march 1 to march 5,2006- - -if i had to stay any longer i would have lost my mind .
		1
		actually , i tried to switch to another hotel after breakfast on our second day , but they were full .
		0
		i can make a few positive comments about paradisus , the casino was nice , the beach was beautiful , the japanese restaurant was delicious but otherwise this was the worst resort i have ever stayed at anywhere .
		0
		let me preface my comments by the fact that we were in the dominican republic in february from the 2nd thru the 9th and could not wait to go back !
		0
		we had stayed at the iberostar bavaro suites on that trip .
		0
		i will try to be specific in my criticisms and comments .
		1
		my first impression upon driving up was that the resort was tired .
		1
		i quickly changed that to rundown and neglected everything was overgrown , none of the landscaping was maintained ; what should have been flowering shrubs were only green , since nothing had been done to them .
		0
		the lawns were not maintained .
		1
		people had cut paths across the property and nothing had been done to correct them . no one removed any debris from shrubery or lawns .
		0
		i did not see one person working on the grounds during the five days that we were there - -either cleaning or maintenance - -with the exception of a worker painting a bridge with oil - based paint at 10am making the entire lobby uninhabitable due to the fumes . ! ! !
		0
		the trees outside our royal service room were #2271 were touching the building , coming into the terrace , and making the room dark .
		3
		it was like being in a tropical rain forest , dark , and dreary .
		3
		the room was basically clean , but someting i have never seen was here . . . .our bathroom had no doors it was on the left as you enter the room , and then there were swinging shutters ( about three feet high ) separating the toilet area .
		1
		the linens were thin and shabby . garbage and cigarettes were left in the containers along the paths .
		0
		we were walking on the beach by seven . . . .the beach was cleared of seaweed , etc . and then those giant black garbage bags were left at the entrances to the beach all day . . . .you found yourself walking past trash bags at four in the afternoon . .
		0
		the feet washers leaving the beach did not work . . . you wound up going to lunch or back to your room with sandy feet .
		0
		some days , there werer no towels , someone took one of ours , and when we went to happy hour at the pool , a guest overheard us , and told us that they had to steal towels all week from other guests ! ! - -they tol us how to do it when they were left unattended - - classy no ? half of the beach chairs were broken . . . .no back supports , and all of them were sagging and old , and dirty .
		0
		there was no waiter service on the regular beach . . . more to come on that . the buffets were a nauseating experience .
		0
		the food selection was very limited , nothing was marked , and you were greeted by raw pork on ice , and raw fish . .the presentation was awful , nothing was hot .
		0
		now , i know this will sound unbelievable , but it truly happened : i went to take a piece of french toast from one of the steam tables , when the tongs made contact with the tray , i got an electric shock ! ! !
		1
		i called the hostess , she tried the same thing , and she got an electic shock !
		0
		there was a conference with some workers , and they unplugged the tray without a word to me .
		1
		there was one stone - faced chef making omeletes .
		4
		behind him is a giant garbage pail , and a dirty rusted pole . the air - conditioned area at the other buffet had the same greasy hand prints on the glass for two days - - - one being a child 's print at knee height and another a full man 's hand print at eye level . . .
		0
		these with assorted greasy smudges . . .what does this tell you ? after my electrocution i had had enough , and went to the general manager . . . mr .
		0
		i enumerated my complaints to him , telling him i would have been gone to iberostar bavaro , if they had any rooms . . . he upgraded us to royal service for the remainder of our trip , somewhat better , but in my estimation , not worth it . .
		0
		we were moved to a different section of the beach with nice beachchairs , and there was wait service in this section .
		3
		however , it was such a small section , that people were right on top of each other . i sat next to a family who came with a cooler bag , and lays potatoe chips - - - and listened to the mom 's concerns about her daughter 's diaper exploding in the water . . . this was all done in a scream .
		2
		most of the guests were americans , and there were a good number of screaming kids .
		1
		royal service has a separate breakfast room , a nice curtained enclosed room , which again served a limited buffet .
		1
		i do not go to the carribean to eat breakfast indoors though , i could have stayed in ny for that ! ! royal service and we had to flag down the waiter for coffee !
		2
		and the milk was bad ! ! you ca not make it up ! ! royal service did make our dinner reservations , and liz in that section was ever so nice .
		2
		we did not get the promised newspaper in the morning .
		1
		i do not want anyone to unpack my bags - - one of the services included , and i would not get into the room jacuzzi , which they would fix for you .
		0
		royal service costs $70 per person per nite more , while nice , definitely not worth it , since many of the things you receive are just regular service in other hotels .
		2
		and now to top it off , when we were leaving , the cart carrying us and our bags broke down in the middle of the property on the way back to meet our bus ! !
		0
		the driver had to flag someone down , transfer our bags , push the one trolly off the path , and we just made our departure bus ! !
		0
		you could not make it up ! ! ! having been to the dominican republic twice before , i find this hotel to be an extremely bad representation of the dominican people .
		0
		my impression was that the people working at the resort seemed - - in general - -unhappy .
		1
		the number of really pleasant people could be noted .
		1
		my impression was that the resot might be closing , the manager , mr . castillo said no , they were doing a seven million dollar addition , new pool , beach club for royal service , i suggested that they put some money in general maintenance and service .
		0
		do not go here ! ! ! questions ?

		poor customer " service " ruined this vacation we are frequent travelers for both business and pleasure , and so have a lot of experience with which to compare this report .
		0
		although the beach and resort were lovely , this resort had the poorest customer service we have ever experienced .
		0
		although we specifically booked and paid extra for the 'royal service ' what we received was quite the opposite .
		1
		i can honestly say we have never been treated more poorly .
		0
		we felt tolerated rather than welcome , and there were many times we felt like second - class citizens . a few brief examples : we were placed in an unrenovated room with construction going on in our building when many other rooms appeared to be available .
		1
		our request to be moved was declined ( we were told that there was nothing available - although it was clear that some rooms were vacant ! ) .
		1
		so we awoke early to banging many mornings . although there was a wine list at each meal , we were repeatedly told that whatever our choices happened to be ( and we went down the list ! ) were not available .
		3
		we were asked to chose between 'red ' and 'white ' and then were served the same two , poor quality wines .
		0
		however , we watched other ( spanish - speaking ) guests order from the list and different bottles from the list mysteriously appeared at their table .
		0
		we were consistently not seen when asking for service on the beach ( supposedly part of the royal service package ) , but spanish speaking guests around us received excellent attention and service .
		1
		when i went up to the beach bar myself , i watched as the bartender made me drinks without alcohol , and then insisted they were alcoholic .
		0
		when this happened a second time and i said something , he laughed and turned to a co - worker and made some rude remarks in spanish , assuming i would not understand .
		0
		( i did not understand it all , but i am aware of the meanings of ' - - - - ' and ' - - - - '.
		4
		i assure you they are not complimentary ) .when turnign on a light in our room , i received a severe electrical shock and burn from the lamp , which had old and frayed wiring .
		0
		when we told the customer service staff , they appeared unconcerned , and merely said they would remove the lamp ( which they never did ) .
		0
		no apology , no offer of medical attention for the burn , which kept me out of both the sun and water . i could go on , but in short , we felt like second - class citizens and were tolerated rather than welcomed .
		1
		there were also obvious differences in the way spanish - speaking clientele were treated .
		0
		it is unclear whether language barrier difficulties ( most staff , even those specifically in customer service , spoke no or very little english ) contributed to this . my advice ?
		2
		the beach is absolutely lovely in punta cana .
		0
		stay at another resort .
		1
		if , for some reason , you still want to go to paradisus , absolutely do not pay for the upgrade of royal service .
		0
		if what we got was royal service , i am afraid to guess how other non - royal guests were treated .

		do not go getting through the airport was a trip by itself ; we filled out an entry form on the plane but there is another one that we have to fill out at the airport and then we have to buy a tourist card .
		3
		following local laws is one thing but at least they should post the entry procedures clearly and preferably in english so that we do not get the impression that we are being chipped away .
		2
		ground transportation by hotelbeds was ok but an attempt was made to get us to go on tours that are included in our all - inclusive package .
		3
		when we got to paradisus , we were told that we have to spend a night at another nearby resort and come back to paradisus the next day .

		the only restaurant where we had a great meal and service was el romantico .

		2
		you can get there by walking on the beach or out of the front lobby . needless to say , i would not recommend this resort to anyone .

		i will start off by saying the grounds were beautiful . . . like being in the middle of a jungle paradise ; however that 's where all the positives stop .
		1
		the a/c like others have noticed , was not functional upon arrival .
		2
		we changed rooms to find working a/c , but non working refrigeration in the mini refrigerator .
		3
		the toilet did not work correctly , but the room was very nice overall . the area of major concern to me , is in what appears to me in my opinion , to be the heavy odor of what smelled like raw sewerage on the grounds and again in my opinion , to be a possible contamination of the food supply or what appeared to be a lack of cold enough temperatures of the food and drinks at the food counters .
		0

		this helped us to make it through , but barely .
		2
		in all my visits to the domincan republic , i have never been ill like this . the food was terrible at best and not consumable at the least , in my opinion .
		0
		add in the horrible smells from constant air pollution caused by all of the worn out motors from the trolley 's and motorbikes used by the staff and you have the recipe for a difficult vacation .
		2
		i would find another resort with less traffic and possibly safer food . the beach chairs are extremely uncomfortable , making extended sun tanning difficult unless you lay on the sand .
		0
		the trash bin plastic bags on the beach where never removed for change ; the attendant would only reach in by hand and remove the dumped daily garbage by hand and transfer the contents to his bag , leaving old food matter constantly drying in the receptacles or on the ground around the bins .
		2
		it is almost impossible to communicate with anyone at any restaurant .
		0
		my wife has an allergy to garlic and they put garlic in virtually everything .
		0
		i asked each and every waiter to avoid garlic ( in spanish ) but i do not even think they know what garlic is .
		0
		we ended up with garlic in almost any food item ordered or any item offered at the buffet . the only positive result of the trip was the loss of 6 pounds of weight , which now puts me back at my waist size during college .

		not the resort ! ! ! peye .
		0
		ontario , what a disappointment .
		1
		just came back from a week stay at bavaro princess , d . r , big disapointment , before booking the trip for nineteen of my family , i read the reviews on this resort , some were good and some were bad , since it is a five star resort , we are not very picky peaple , and have traveled to punta cana many times before and always had a great time , we stayed at b . p from dec/18?2008 to dec/25/2008 , when we arrive at the resort , it seem like a pretty nice place but seem to be a little dimmed around the lobby , the check in went o . k , no wellcome cocktail drinks , we proceeded to have our dinner , it was just o . k with less variety than usual .
		2
		the room we had was near the beach and the main pool , therefore was very convinient for the kids , all of our rooms had crockcroaches and some even had crockcroaches eggs under the pillow cases , we ate at japanese alacart and the seafood , both time we ordered food , everything ended up to be the same , waste of time , food quality was terrible , evening shows were boring , perhaps inexperience m . c made it even more boring , most of the staffs were nice at the bars and at the restaurants , ground keepers worked tiredlessly to keep the property look pretty nice , we enjoyed the wild lifes , flemingos , peakcocks , fish , birds ects . . . . . the most disappointment aprt of the hold trip was the animacion ( enterainment ) crews , they do not seem to have much connection with the resort guests but maby think of themselfs as somekind of superstars , not even a genuend friendly hola , around the pool there were 'nt much activity , first five days , we did 'nt even hear any local music played , only techno music , it did ''nt give the feeling of beeing away , so in summory , the trip was a ripoff , we paid for a 5 star resort but only got maby 3.5 star service .

		would not recommend to any of our friends and definately not going back to bavaro princess resort .

		do not do it . . . head the warnings and bad reviews . . . book somewhere else ! my wife and i booked our honeymoon through a travel agent in our area with apple vacations .
		0
		the price seemed more than fair and by the personal recommendation of the travel agent we booked our honeymoon to the bavaro princess resort in punta cana .
		0
		we paid for the platinum upgrade , which as explained to us , would entitle us to premium alcohol , nicer room , extra nice meals and other amenities .
		1
		upon arriving at our resort , we were taken to the platinum lounge were we proceeded to wait for two hours before we could check in to our room .
		0
		now , we do understand that people may have checked out of that room late , but after observing how slow the housekeeping was during the week , we are guessing that was the cause .
		2
		after waiting over two hours for our room to be ready , we went to the room to find it in what had appeared to be immaculate condition right down to the label on the toilet suggesting it was sanitized .
		4
		considering my wife is a clean freak , she inspected the toilet before going to the bathroom to find that there was human ficies still smeared on and around the sanitized toilet .
		0
		outraged , we called the platinum lounge to express our concern and they assured us that someone would be over right away to re - clean it .
		0
		several phone calls later and several hours having passed , a maid did finally show up to clean said toilet .
		0
		a few hours later we spent some time killing huge cock roaches that seemed to come out of the wood work near the tv and couches .
		1
		we expressed our concern about these issues to the apple rep at our resort and he assured us he would take care of it .
		0
		he did offer to have our room exterminated but we would not be able to be in it for several hours after .
		0
		several hours later and several times of reminding him that we were waiting to hear back from him , he informed us that the manager was going to send champaign to our room for the inconvenience .
		0
		the following day , our 10 dollar bottle of champaign arrived with a small cheese plate .
		0
		this behind us , we proceeded to enjoy the rest of our honeymoon .
		0
		the food at the resort restaurants was absolutely terrible .
		0
		my wife and i both got sick from something we either ate or drink ; as did several other couples we met throughout our time there .
		2
		the restaurants that were included as part of our platinum upgrade were worse then the buffet food in the main dining room .
		1
		we paid for the platinum upgrade especially to receive the premium alcohol , and every time we asked for anything to be considered premium , they were out of it .
		1
		we did not get anything premium until we went to the bar at one of the sister resorts we were allowed to go to .
		0
		we booked two excursions with apple by recommendation of the reps at the resort , which were the outback safari and the dolphin island .
		1
		the outback safari was well worth our time and money and we enjoyed that day immensely .
		2
		the dolphin island excursion was a different story .
		1
		this excursion costs $110 a person , which is steep to begin with .
		1
		what a racket this excursion is .
		3
		the entire trip is supposed to be 5 hours and it was five and a half hours .
		1
		the bad thing is that only an hour of it was spent actually near the dolphins .
		2
		the trip to and from the island took over 30 minutes each way .
		0
		we spent an hour waiting to go out to the water after arriving .
		0
		the hour with the dolphins was amazing to say the least .
		2
		we were taken back to the beach where they proceeded to sell us dvds with photos from our experience .
		0
		this privilege cost us another 30 bucks .
		1
		after waiting another half hour we received our dvd and then proceeded to wait over two hours for them to organize everyone to get back on the buses to return to the resort .
		0
		several people were complaining to the staff but it seemed the staff was only concerned with making sure everyone bought a dvd before getting back on the buses .
		2
		i had read some reviews about this resort prior to traveling there and the most popular complaint was regarding transportation issues .
		0
		the resort is set on a few acres and it is a bit of a walk from the beach to the main lobby or from the rooms to the buffet .
		2
		the resort has a vehicle that stops at several designated areas to pick people up .
		0
		nine times out of ten this vehicle was full by the time it reached us so we decided to walk the rest of our time there .
		0
		this proved to be a bad idea since the road to walk on went through an area where the resort had a sewage problem .
		2
		i can?? even describe how bad the stench was in this area .
		0
		they even had caution tape around the majority of the area .
		1
		i am sure walking past this area four times a day on average was not good for our overall health .
		1
		the night before leaving we paid our bill so we could have express check out in the morning before our departure .
		4
		i asked guest services when i should call in the morning to have our baggage picked up so we could have time to eat before our bus came .
		0
		they informed us that ten minutes we be sufficient .
		4
		the morning came and just to be on the safe side i called them 45 minutes prior to our scheduled departure time from the resort .
		0
		35 minutes later , they finally showed up to grab our baggage and we raced to the main lobby to catch our bus .
		0
		we had no time to eat and it was the perfect ending to a miserable vacation .

		i do not know about you , but when i pay to go on vacation , i want the memories to be great and not something i have to spend time after warning others to prepare themselves for disappointment if they are going to that resort .

		2
		this resort is spread on vast grounds , the trains seem to be always crowded , and finding seat during evening hours seemed impossible . the worst was food .
		0
		the main buffet is open without ac , we did not enjoy eating while getting sweat at the same time .

		and food was bad , plain and tasteless .
		3
		one evening it was all about oriental food , we noticed more ppl ended up @ american station taking hamburgers and hotdogs rather than oriental cuisine . and final nail was chopin restaurant .
		1
		not sure why its called that , because its in fact an open buffet , with lots of seafood .
		1
		while i am a seafood lover , after it i ended up with food poisoning for entire our remaining time in dr .
		4
		and to tell the truth , after all iiwas not surprised , seeing flies and moths getting cozy in some salads . so after spending 2 days in bavarro , we could not wait to get back to occidental flamenco , where we enjoyed far superior quality and overall satisfaction .

		4th and last time !
		3
		last week i stayed at this resort , party of 2. we had platinum service .
		0
		this was my 4th visit in 3 years to this resort , all of which were either platinum , or the previous vip program . the vacation was through ac vacations , and the flight down from toronto was excellent .
		2
		we were bumped up to business class for free at the gate , and the flight was on time . we arrived at the resort at around 11am , and after waiting for one of the golf carts that ferries guests around for 10 minutes in order to go check in at the platinum lounge , we have up and walked to it - - since we are familiar with the resort .
		1
		when we got to the lounge , we were the first to check in from our arriving group , suggesting the golf cart transportation had still not arrived .
		0
		perhaps not suprisingly , our room would not be ready until 3pm , the stated check in time .

		why was not my room ready ?
		0
		well , my room was not ready because the guest in there before just did not check out .
		1
		i was comforted by the desk agent by him telling me that they had charged the guest $40 dollars for our inconvenience .
		0
		of course , we were not given the $40 bucks , or really anything for that matter other than shrugged shoulders . the room was ideally situated , close to the pool , beach and lounge . . . but the a/c hardly worked , and the water pressure all week was terrible .
		4
		we got fed up with the a/c on the second day , and they moved us up to an ocean view suite which also had bad a/c , no water pressure , no hot water except at times that you do not need it ( like 2pm ) .
		0
		i complained a few times , but eventually gave up - - not worth the effort , as the management was pretty apathetic . we met two other couples who had the same problems in platinum .
		1
		in fact , one couple was given a non - platinum suite and the only compensation offered was an extra 20 min massage . . . and that was after a lot of effort going through the ac vacations rep . food : the only things i had all week that were good was steak at el gaucho , pasta at the pasta station in the hispaniola buffet , and boiled eggs by the beach in the morning .

		it is a long bus ride , then you go out on speed boats . . . which was very fun .
		2
		they take you to a natural pool in the ocean and feed you drinks , then back into the boat for a ride over to saona , which is supposedly an unspoiled beach .
		2

		after that , we had a wonderful sail for 1.5 hrs in a tropical storm , then a bus ride to punta cana with a stop in higuey - - actually , they dumped us at a tourist place where we could buy rum and paintings at american prices . the highlight of the trip was coming home .

		since we had already changed our flight ( and they knew this since julio explicitly asked me if we had done so ) , i felt the hotel had pulled a switch in order to exploit a minor amount of money from me .

		a group of 34 of my friends went to the bavaro princess for our friends wedding .
		1
		we originally were booked at the punta cana princess but were switched to the bavero two weeks before because of renovations .
		2
		we walked over to the hotel we were suppose to be at and we could not find a nail or a hammer anywhere there were no renovations .
		0
		so basically they were trying to move us all into one resort so that they did not have to have both open but did not want to close the other one so that people would still book with princess . i will touch on three the following issues 1. drugs in my drink ;2. all restaurants closed ( except main buffet ) ;3. rooms not ready ;4.
		0
		luggage didn?? show up ;5.
		0
		not enough trains for the big resort to take you from lobby , your room or pool  beach ;6. staff wedding day wearing jeans ;7. no making reservations ;8. lights out by 11:30 on resort ( can?? find you way around )9. septic smells so badso when we got the bavaro princess at 1:30 pm all of our rooms were not ready . . including the bride and groom?? .
		0
		we had to wait until 3:30 until we got them . . some of us still did not get them to after 4:30.
		1
		we then had to wait for our bags from there bell boys until 5:30 pm . that was awful service .
		2
		the rooms were really nice but our phone did not work and i asked everyday for a new phone but no one came to bring one . . . despite all my complaints .
		1
		i even went to the front desk and they told me that ??aybe? ? they would be able to send someone to look at it .
		3
		they even recommended that i go back to my room with one of their off duty staff to look at it with him .
		0
		i am a 25 year old woman and there is no way i would feel safe going back to my room with a man i don?? even know that isn?? wearing a staff uniform or a name tag to look at my broken phone .
		0
		still no phone even on our last day when they said they would fix it and give us a wake up call so we wouldn?? miss our flight . the resort is huge so walking from the lobby to the beach or even to your rooms is at least 15 minutes? ? and the septic smell in one section is soooo strong that it is enough to make you gag .
		0
		they also turn the lights out before 11:30 at night so the entire resort is dark and you can?? find you way along the dark paths or even see room numbers of all the villa?? .
		0
		my friends mom was walking alone from the buffet at night and they shut down the lights and she came back to the buffet really worked up , upset and scared .
		3
		even though there are guards with guns on the beach infront of the resort it doesn?? really make it feel any safer when it is completely dark .
		0
		the trolleys that drive you around don?? run late and even if they are running ( before midnight ) they drive past you and are often full of people .
		0
		they only had one running so you had to wait over 25 mins for one to come by you and it would be full and wouldn?? stop .
		0
		it happened to rain everyday we were there so we often stood in the rain waiting . all the restaurants were closed and they just had the buffet open .
		0
		sometimes you had to wait in line to even get in .
		0
		if you called to make a reservation for one of the promised restaurants they would say they are booked and then when you would go to them they were empty .
		0
		they were suppose to be available but they weren?? and they moved the special restaurants into the main buffet so they didn?? have to have the other buildings open . for my friends wedding the staff was disorganized and not very accommodating . . they kept moving the location on us . my one friend?? dad went to complain to the manager and they said they would try to up the service a bit? ?
		0
		but didn?? .
		0
		when we wrote the resort a letter they said there were no complaints . . that was a lie . . we all complained . we booked a day trip through the resort to go snorkeling . . the bus didn?? show .
		0
		we booked another day trip to go fishing and they messed up the days and switched it to the day of the wedding when no one could go . we were suppose to stay at the tropical princess down the beach but two weeks before they switched us to this hotel due to renovations . . we went to see it and there were no renovations . . just a slow time of year and they didn?? want both of their hotels running? ? complete

( and u better have a reservation ) after an all day at the beach with 100 degree weather , then go ahead - almost entire resort no ac .
		3
		i mean noooooooooooo ac for someone traveling with kids not a good placehotel service - workers are terrible , no customer service , rude people , i had my phone broken for 3 days b4 anyone cared to fix it , no one to complaint to , do it in writing when u get back home they suggested - if for any reason you flight is delayed , pray to god anyone tells you , there will be a note posted on a binder for you to read , where is the binder ?
		0
		hahahahahso good luck - no accomodations provided if ur flight is delayed , again u wait under 100 degree weather , with no room or shower for ur kids or even urself , -hotel is not responsible if transportation between airport and resort isnt on time , so u might even lose ur flight - in the event of a flight delay , if you came in with apple tour , please be ready , you will be given only a 3 minutes long distance phone call after 6 hours wait . , again no room provided - no one is allowed in hotel if they dun have a bracelet , of course excluding those providing a happy ending for certain guests , - only 2 pools , and if you are vip , make sure u dun request a towel at the non vip pool , wont get it , vip pool barely cleaned , u can actually smell the urine - vip isnt any different than anyone else , u still be given watered down alcohol , not worthywatch out for the train ! ! , yes train to transport u to ur room and back to lobby , and they dun run 24/7only + about it was the entertainment at night - please you dont wanna experience this for urself , bigger is not any better

		not that great . . . . my trip to the bavaro princess was terrible , i have been to the dominican 3 years in a row and stayed at the sister hotel ( caribe club ) so thought i would try this hotel .
		1
		first of all , there was no hot water at all and we were there for seven days ! ! ! ! ! seocndally , they gave us a promotional 100$ royal dollars to cash in for the casino - -very good promotion , however to cash it you need to attend a meeting .
		1
		it would be good if they explain this because i brought it to the casino and they did not know what to do with it and then the hotel lobby told me i had to attend the meeting - -i am on vacation and do not have time to attend meetings , i just want to have fun ! ! ! ! lastly , the service at the information desk is only spanis , i understand that is there main tongue , however , it is a resort with several tourists , having them be bilingual would be more of an asset . . . especially since it is the information desk ? ! ?

		3
		on my urging my wife booked our trip through travelocity for the two of us and our three children and my brother who had his own room .
		0
		immediately upon our arrival to the resort the employees at the concierge desk were very eager to help us make dinner reservations for that night and in return we attend a 90 minute presentation of a sol melia vacation club . that night we ate at the guarapo the dominican restaurant which was very good as were all the restaurants the problem was getting a reservation .
		0
		dinner reservations are obtained by calling ext 6313 after 9 am but by the time you get through at around 9:15 am everthing was taken so you would need to call at 1:30 pm to see if there were any cancellations so instead of enjoying yourself at the beach or pool you needed to be worried about getting back to the room to call again .
		0
		the problem with the reservations for dinner goes back to the sol melia vacation club as the employees use it as a way to get you to go in exchange for dinner reservations they get points ?
		0

		we went to the presentation on the third day of our stay after becoming friendly with guillermo one of the towel boys at the pool .

		the presentation actually took around three hours in which they took us to there other resorts which were beautiful but we did not wish to purchase the membership .
		2
		my brother was actually confronted by the concierge who had originally had scheduled the presentation he is known as erasmo . com he stopped my brother in the lobby and questioned him as to why we had gone to the presentation after he had made dinner reservations for us .
		0
		my brother did not answer this employee but called guest relations and spoke to maralys and told her what had happened and she was very apologetic and would look into it and sent a fruit platter and a bottle of rum to both of our rooms which was a nice gesture but not needed if the employees would just do there job .
		1
		speaking of empolyees who do there job well was mario the bartender at the bar he was fantastic . there were many others who are very eager to please . like i said before the restaurants capri ( seafood ) , guarapo ( dominican ) , hokkaido ( japanese ) , ma maison ( french ) were excellent except that my daughter got sick the night after eating in the french restaurant ( she threw up twice ) .
		0
		the gondola ( italian ) was ok and the a/c was broken so it was warm in the restaurant .
		0
		as far as our room was concerned the a/c was never cold enough the maid would turn off the electricity in the room after cleaning it so when we would come in from the beach/pool we would have to turn it on by turning the card around upon entering the room .
		0
		i needed to spend 30 minutes every evening killing the mosquitoes , i also spent alot of time in the bathroom flushing the toilet as there was not alot of water pressure .

		i finally figured it out and found a kids sand bucket at the pool and would fill that with water and use it to flush . i actually thought about leaving after our third or fourth day there .

		2
		the washrooms are far from the beach with all the logical consequences and the calm standing waters of the ocean make it nastier .

		you have to wear a shirt , shorts and sandals in the beach buffets so if your bathing suit is still damp and you are hungry you again have to be inconvenienced one way or the other . the rooms are old and dated and if you don?? give a bribe your room will probably face a very busy road with roaring smelly vehicles and a train that rings its bell at all hours of day or night .

		the next morning the tour operator?? rep established that ground floor apartments were and had been available at the time of our arrival and arranged for us to be moved .

		however , as i threatened to break the window unless action was taken immediately , the technician , this time , arrived quickly to resolve the problem . the apartments were large and generally well cleaned , although sometimes this could be somewhat hit and miss , the procedure for reserving seating at the various restaurants for dinner left a lot to be desired .

		3
		i will not come back to hotel casablanca . although the hotel has some nice amenities ( that they are proud of ) such as wine and cheese from 5-8 pm , that did not make up for the lack of security , and the horrible , horrible sausage smell in our room .
		0
		yes , sausage .
		4
		i was also sorely disappointed with the level of professionalism and service from the front desk staff . security first , as that is a more specific and tangible concern .

		there is usually just one person behind the front desk , and when we walked in at 11:00 pm on sunday evening ( no doorman , except once during the three days and two nights we were there ) he did not even look up from whatever he was doing and only greeted us when we were already up the stairs .

		and alas , while clean and spacious for a nyc hotel room ( and i have stayed in many ) reeked of sausage when we first opened the door .
		0
		each time we returned to the room , we were assaulted with the smells .

		i attribute the odor to the window unit air conditioner and the proximity of restaurants .
		2
		when i first went down to ask to change the room , the clerk did not apologize , said there was no room to change us to , and handed me a can of air freshener .

		had we got this room for the full 4 nights i too would have had nothing but good things to say about this hotel but the first 2 nights of construction noise really spoiled our stay .

		despite having slept well on the saturday night , the two sleepless nights caught up with us on the sunday - and although we had planned to see a matinee show , we were utterly knackered and had to come back to the hotel for a snooze which was such a waste of an afternoon in new york .
		2
		i agree that location is good ; staff very nice ; and ricks bar is good ( especially when you are awake at 2am and want a hot drink ! ) but i would urge anyone going over the next few weeks to enquire about the construction work that is taking place across the road from the hotel .

		not what we expected from a ritz - carlton we stayed in the ritz - carlton for 5 nights during a recent vacation ; the service was excellent ( if somewhat spotty ) , but the overall experience was less than what we expected from a ritz .
		1
		we are frequent travelers and during the past 5 years we have taken 10 extended vacations and never had occasion to complain about anything ; we 're not easily ruffled , and it takes a lot to make me call guest services - -something we had to do several times during our stay .
		2
		here are the things we had to complain about : 1) when we took a blanket out of the closet to put it on the bed , it was wadded in a ball and had a huge piece of dried cheese stuck right on top .
		0
		housekeeping brought a new blanket immediately and it was warm and fresh .2) we had a standard room which could be used as an adjoining room .
		0
		on the third day , someone checked in to the adjoining room and we could hear everything they said , even though they were speaking in normal voices .
		2
		i could hear the man whistling little drummer boy - that 's not right .
		0
		we were woken up at 1:30 am when the couple returned from a night out ; they received 4 phone calls within 20 minutes and we heard every word of every call .
		0
		that should not happen at a ritz .
		1
		to the credit of the ritz staff , we called guest services at 2:00 am and asked for a non - adjoining room , which they quickly located for us and we were moved within 15 minutes .
		1
		excellent service .3)
		0
		the next day we had to call guest services again and ask for a new iron , since the one in the new room was coming apart and did not work .
		3
		i did not want to have to call again ( i felt we had already earned a reputation as hard to please , unfairly ) , but we could not show up for dinner in wrinkled clothes . . . they brought a new iron within 5 minutes .
		0
		we had an excellent time despite the small problems , but we concluded that the hotel quality was more in line with a 3- star hotel .
		1
		we 've stayed in hiltons and sheratons that were much nicer than the ritz , and for much less .

		good for business travel ; worthless as a resort for a business traveler , this hotel has some things to offer , namely : nice beds and bathrooms , proximity to the airport , decent in - house restaurants , an air of quasi - luxury , and a passable bar/lounge .
		4
		with that in mind , memo to hotel execs : two things any business hotel absolutely must have are (1) easy access to starbucks - - fail - - and (2) wireless internet in every room - - fail .
		1
		these are not hard to accomplish , and something pretty much every hampton inn has managed by now .
		4
		so even as a business hotel , it misses the mark . as a resort , i would love to have been in on the meeting which informed the planning and decisions behind this property .
		0
		it 's as though they decided to have a resort and left all the planning to someone who had never been on vacation .
		4
		first - - why on earth would you situate a resort on the most inhospitably windy point on the entire island .
		0
		the wind is insufferable , strong , constant , and nagging .
		0
		it blows the dirt - like sand everywhere , and every chaise is coated to the point where they do not appear blue , but brown .
		3
		you ca not hear the person next to you , it 's so loud .
		0
		i 'm surprised more reviews do not mention this .
		3
		it is very , very inhospitable , the windiness ( the staff told me the wind was typical ) .
		1
		another point about location - - remote from everything .
		3
		$50 bucks round trip to old san juan . if you are going to have a windy beach and pool area , for god 's sake , heat the pool .
		1
		i 'm here on a weekend that is jam - packed , and have seen 9-10 people use the frigid pool the entire time .
		0
		it is freezing , and when you get out , the wind is chilling .
		0
		it does not help that the pool is beneath a forest of palm trees that effectively blocks the sun almost entirely .
		3
		the hot tub has the usual resort problems .
		1
		it 's not hot .
		3
		it 's filled with infants and screaming children .
		2
		why bother , really ? the gym has a lot of decent equipment packed into a regular - sized hotel room .
		0
		it 's unacceptable and pathetic .
		2
		if they moved the same exact equipment into a space three times the size , it would be decent and even good .
		1
		they should do away with the yoga studio ( and i do yoga every day , so i 'm not putting yoga down ) , and expand the gym facility or just do away with it altogether .
		0
		it 's almost dangerous how packed it is .
		4
		again , it appears to have been planned by someone who does not use gyms .
		0
		nice idea , bad execution . on the upside - - great staff , good concierge , great in - house restaurants , picturesque .
		1
		rooms are nice , though the standard room has a fairly small window and it gets a little dark .
		2
		the showerhead sucks but decent water pressure .
		3
		tips - - the el san juan hotel down the road has 2 starbucks and a very good restaurant called coco that was pretty empty .
		2
		the hamachi appetizer is good , crab balls were good , drinks were amazing .
		2
		the little gelato store 2 buildings down has cheap , decent lunch and great gelato .
		3
		walgreens next to that for snacks , cokes , and lotion .
		0
		dont bother with ritz poolside food and drinks .
		4
		lame on all accounts .
		3
		blt steak and il mulino both fine . in sum , the very , very low end of the ritz brand .
		3
		not a good location for laid back sun , and poorly planned/designed .
		3
		go somewhere else for fun .

		most un - ritz ritz hotel this hotel truly is not a ritz , should change their name to something else as it gives the ritz a bad name .
		1
		i would not recommend to anyone looking forward to staying at a ritz . we first had multiple calls and emails with the hotel about our basic needs , early arrival ( they asked for the time ) , connecting rooms , and late checkout by one hour .
		1
		on the phone everything was fine , very pleaseant , and waiting for us .
		0
		we had 2 rooms for a week . but when we got there at 2pm , problem with the rooms , will not be ready for 45 mins .

		after an hour they finally told us they did not know when the rooms will be ready .
		0
		we figured we can hang out there until 4, by 4:30 our rooms where ready and we went up .
		0
		no appology , no we are sorry , their attitude at the front desk is more holidayinn express than ritz . room was missing a few things , like garbage can , room service menu , but where resolved by tracking down the service crew . one night (3 am ) we lost power in the room , we woke up very hot as the a/c was out , that is when we realize we had no power .
		1
		however the hallway was fully lit , and the outside of the hotel had full power .
		1
		a call to the front desk told us nothing , some rooms where out of power and they would work on it .
		2
		power came back by 7 or so , we got no sleep that night .
		0
		no appologies , no comments , this is not a ritz .
		2
		other things to consider :1.
		2
		beach closes at 5:30, no chairs or umbrellas from then until the next day2.
		1
		the a/c in the rooms , when it worked , was either subzero or tropical heat , no matter what temperature you set it at .3.
		3
		poolside restaurant has over 12 employees , good luck getting them to pay attention to you the only customer sitting there as they will be busy socializing with each other4.
		2
		we had a very undercooked burger at the restaurant , we had to send it back and they charged us for 2 of them , since they had to cook it twice ( amazing ! ! )5.
		0
		the pool area and beach and fully open to all locals , no restrictions .
		1
		so do not plan to use the pool or beach on a weekend , it will be like a free community pool/beach .
		3
		use those days to travel elsewhere .
		3
		the good news is my sister and her whole family could just walk in and meet us , have full use of the hotel , the bad news is so could every other local resident .6.
		0
		the valet parking is the only ritz level of service area of the hotel .
		1
		the rest is okay for hotel service , but far from ritzin closing , lower your expectations and you will be happy if you stay here .

		not quite what we expected if you are used to staying at high - end 4 or 5 star resorts , this is probably not the right resort for you .
		2
		although the property is somewhat nice and the views are spectacular , this resort is absolutely not worth the money .
		2
		all the reviews about broken elevators and service problems are absolutely accurate .
		1
		we stayed in the marina area and to get to the room , we had to ride the funculars up and down the hillside .
		0
		when they were working , it was not an issue .
		3
		however , if one of them was broken , it took forever to get to the room or up to the resort .
		1
		there is no alternative way to get down to the marina so it was not the best experience .
		0
		although our room was renovated and well decorated , the new decor could not make up for the major ant problem in the room ( even though we were on the top floor and did not leave food out ) and the cleanliness of the room .
		2
		minor renovations were also needed but obviously not attended to . although there is a resort shuttle to/from the airport , they did not bother telling us that the ride was $140.
		1
		it just showed up on our bill .
		3
		the service is slow at this resort ( our iron broke and it took an hour to get a new one ) and the room service is outrageously slow and expensive .
		2
		it took an hour each time ( and they were 15 minutes later than promised ) and 2 breakfast egg plates w/ coffee will run you $85. on the positive side , the food and service at the restaurants is great .
		0
		although expensive , we do not mind paying for good food and service .
		1
		i highly recommend blossom 's and the stingray cafe for dinner .
		3
		for lunch , we loved the ballyhoo bar/grill outside in the marina .
		3
		the casino does not comp and they only have blackjack and caribbean stud tables , and slots , but we enjoyed the time we spent there . the highlight of our trip was our fishing excursion with capt .
		3
		marcos of light tackle paradise .
		2
		we booked through the hotel ( big mistake - they pocket $250 of the fee ) .
		3
		i definitely recommend capt .
		2
		marcos ' fishing trips , though .
		3
		call him directly at 787- fishing .
		2
		his rates are very affordable and it 'll be worth it ! !i should probably mention that we have stayed twice at the atlantis and that resort really sets the bar high for other resorts in the caribbean .
		1
		in comparison , the el conquistador is not even close .
		1
		the atlantis is expensive too , but worth it .
		1
		there is so much to see and do for free that this resort does not offer .

		2
		i would not recommend this hotel for the average middle class traveler or for the elderly .
		1
		while i am not cheap by any means , this hotel went far beyond my budget .
		2
		a lot of walking is required and climbing stairs to get to various places in the hotel .

		there is even a tram to take you to different areas . hotel : upon arrival we paid for an ocean view room with 2 queen beds .

		( for 4 people ) .

		0
		they offered us an ocean view with one full and an air mattress .
		3
		that was unacceptable !
		1
		they finally upgraded us to la casitas , off the main hotel up on a hill where we had to be driven there , in a golf cart or a mini van if we got lucky , because it is too far from the main hotel ( the driver expected a tip every time ) .
		0
		although the room was large and the view was beautiful they only offer 2 full size beds , which was a problem for us since we were four .
		1
		we were also put on the second floor with a long flight of stairs to climb .
		1
		there were also multiple long flights of stairs down to the pool , which was a huge problem because i was with my parents who are in their late 60s and my mother has health issues , they were not fit enough for the climbing and long walk .
		0
		to get to the main hotel we had to call the hotel transportation and wait outside to be picked up which took anywhere from 10-15 minutes , just to get to a restaurant to eat .
		3
		the second day we demanded the ocean view room we originally paid for , we argued on the phone 3 times and they made us wait 2 hours while they discussed whether they would move us .

		0
		to go down to the marina in order to get to the water park , ferry to palomino island ( the beach ) or the shops and bar  grill , we had to take an elevator down , walk across the entire hotel , and then take a tram down .
		1
		the tram usually had a long wait because so many people needed to get on it .
		3
		please note : there is no beach at the hotel .
		1
		you need to take the ferry to what they call their private beach , which is their only beach .
		1
		the caf? at the beach is also extremely overpriced and they give you barely enough food to hold you for an hour . food : i know resorts usually have expensive food , but the prices were just not a little expensive , they were outrageously expensive .
		1
		there is no choice but to eat within the resort and all the restaurants are overpriced .
		0
		there were no reasonable prices or even just a little expensive places to eat . it does not make sense to rent a car to try to find food cheaper off the resort because parking at the resort is $15/day .
		2
		besides the cost of renting a car , and there really are no decent places to eat outside the resort . be prepared to spend between $15 - 22 for a hamburger and fries . breakfast , lunch and dinner averaged over $100/meal for four people . also be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes for your food everywhere .

		skip this resort my husband and i are easygoing travelers and found this resort based on the recommendation of a few friends who absolutely raved about it .
		0
		the resort has some good qualities , but it one of the worst value vacations we have ever experienced .
		0
		it has the ambiance , food quality , and feel of a mid - range sandals type resort , but is priced like a ritz carlton .
		0
		we spent almost $3000 on a 4 day trip there , with a middle - road ocean view room ( actually we were given a blocked view , but that 's another story ) .
		2
		bottom line - 4 days in hawaii could be done for this price , or 2 weeks in a similar quality all - inclusive adult or family resort . the problems seemed to be mainly service based , rather than facility based ( other than them giving us the wrong room and refusing to acknowledge it ) .
		1
		we are very seasoned travelers and have spent time in the carribean , mexico , africa , europe , and all over small towns in the us - so we are not sheltered yankees with bad attitudes - i promise .
		2
		we maintained our patience the whole time but by the end of the trip we were ready to go home , which is not typical for a 4 day weekend in a supposed luxury resort .
		0
		waiters/waitresses were understaffed , had bad attitudes , and were not attentive .
		1
		pricing throughout the resort was ridiculous ( every meal was $50 for two people , usually a salad and sandwich with soda ) .
		0
		on top of that , there was no authentic puerto rican twist , not even a local type restaurant , on the resort .
		3
		it could have been located anywhere .
		3
		i would suggest to the resort that they space out their conventions or add a convention wing to separate convention guests from other guests .
		4
		they actually closed the main pool on 2 out of the 4 days we were there for the corporate parties , which for us was pretty disheartening .
		1
		there were 2 conventions while were there - chase and b of a , back to back .
		2
		this was a big spring break week , too , so it was 100% capacity .
		3
		the resort should not have booked the hotel to 100% capacity , as the restaurants and staff were not able to handle it .
		3
		again , attitudes were poor , guests were grumbling , and many people 's room bills had invalid charges . i would recommend spending 4 days at the mirage or caesar 's in las vegas , or heading to an all inclusive mega resort in the carribean or mexico instead of spending your money at el conquistador .

		overpriced , over - rated stayed at las casitas at el conquistador for 7 nights with my 3 kids .
		1
		we had a good week , but were very disappointed by several aspects of the hotel .
		1
		first , the food was uniformly terrible , not to mention overpriced .
		1
		the hotel has many restaurants ; we tried 7 or 8 of them and never found one that could make a decent meal aside from breakfast ( but , how hard is it to make scrambled eggs , bacon and fresh fruit ? ) .
		1
		service was friendly , which is fortunate since many restaurants automatically included a 20% gratuity on every bill .
		1
		also , there is lots of walking/traveling involved at this hotel .
		1
		the casitas are nice , set aside from the rest of the hotel .
		1
		but it is a walk to everything .
		2
		the hotel makes a big deal about the personal butler service that comes with the casitas .
		0
		we were told we would have a butler everyday .
		3
		the first day our butler , steve , called and stopped by .
		3
		he was great .
		0
		gave us some tips , brought us a dvd player ( the casita only had an old vhs machine ) .
		0
		but after a couple of days , he had 2 days off and we could not find anyone who was assigned to our casita .
		3
		we enjoyed the water park , although it is small .
		1
		it is at the bottom of the hill , accessible only by two small funiculars that travel up and down the cliff .
		3
		fun for the kids once or twice , but a drag when lots of folks are trying to go to the same place at the same time .
		3
		the waterpark itself has three slides , a lazy river and a shallow area for small children to play .
		2
		if your kids have been to other water parks , be sure to set their expectations fairly low .
		3
		it is certainly more fun than a traditional hotel pool , but it is not that great for a water park .
		2
		and not free .
		3
		the tickets are about $13 for kids and $20 for adults .
		1
		the beach is on a separate island .
		3
		to get there , you take a free ferry ride .
		1
		you can rent rafts , inner tubes and other fun things , but everything is overpriced .
		3
		a kayak is $48 for an hour , for example .
		3
		a noodle , $6. we rented a car from enterprise at the front desk to tour the rain forest - - much cheaper than the $50/person for their half - day tour .
		4
		and we could set our own schedule .
		3
		the rain forest was beautiful and the hiking was great for kids .
		1
		i highly recommend at least a 1/2 day there . we also went on a boat tour of the bioluminescent bay .
		2
		many folks take the kayak tours , but i really recommend the boat , as we got to jump in the water once we were there .
		3
		i did not see any of the kayakers getting into the water . we arranged this trip separately from the hotel with a man named captain suarez .
		3
		he took us in a small boat with about 12 people .
		1
		we would through mangroves in the dark , with captain suarez shining a powerful flashlight onto the mangroves .
		2
		we saw huge iguanas sleeping in the trees and he pointed out lots of ither interesting nature facts .

		0
		there were , however , significant negatives to the hotel which would prevent us from returning :1.

		it took an hour to get from our room to the beach at palomino island .
		2
		you have to take a golf cart to the main hotel , walk about 4 city blocks through parts of the hotel , take an elevator to the tram , wait on line for the tram , wait for the boat to arrive and then travel to the island .
		0
		no part of the trip was unpleasant but that is a considerable amount of time ( especiallyl with kids in tow ) and your entire day had to be planned around trying to get to the beach .2.

		the hotel was extremely crowded ( not suprisingly ) because of the holiday and they seemed unprepared for the crowds .
		0
		by the time we arrived at the beach they ran out of chairs , we had to wait 1 hour to pick up our lunch at the only restaurant on the island , the ice cream parlor in the main hotel ran out of most flavors and one of the restaurants we ate in even ran out of napkins .
		1
		i think this also contributed to the fact that we received very poor customer service from the certain members of the hotel staff .3.
		0
		the hotel adds additional costs at every turn .
		4
		given the cost of our room per night they should not charge an additional fee ( $25 per day per guest ) to use the golden door spa .
		2
		similarly , the $25 per person fee they charged for cancelled dinner reservations in hotel restaurants detered us from making any reservations in advance .

		this proved to be a wise choice because 2 of our children became sick during our visit and we would have spent $150 not to have dinner .

		a dissappointing vacation to say the least a very disappointing experience .
		2
		the hotel is huge and filled with conventions .
		0
		we were put in the los olas section , which is run down , concrete walls chipping , wood railings rotted , and carpeting in the lobby of los olas was filthy .
		3
		our room had been remodeled and was very pretty , but someone had not cleaned properly .
		3
		they were very accommodating and moved us to the marina , a new building and new rooms . . . . . very satisified until we checked into the room ( the only one available , according to them ) and our premium ocean view room was right over the major construction of a water park , coqui , which started promptly at 8am and went until 6pm with backhoes , etc . and way too much noise to even sit on our deck overlooking the ocean !
		1
		the food was outrageously priced . . . . . such as $9.00 for a kids hotdog or $14 for a cheeseburger . . . . . .and the list goes on .
		3
		people were very friendly , however !
		0
		oh , the night kayaking ( $89 per person ) was a huge disappointment .
		2
		the lumenated kayaks were nothing more than a halloween glow stick on the front and back of the boats !
		1
		lots of rowing in the dark to see a little bit of luminance in the water . . . . . .

		frankly , there was no courtesy anythig !
		0
		be prepared to pay for everything . do not be fooled by the pretty recently removated rooms on the web site , these do not exist , at least at the normal people rate .
		1
		one of our rooms was missing a lamp from the wall over the bed , the bathrooms were big , but kind of grimmy from aging .
		0
		the mattreses were awful , you could hear the springs every time you turned . the only really nice thing was the ferry to palominos island .
		1
		the boats are new and the crew very courtious and nice .
		1
		be aware that they do not let you bring even a water bottle on board .
		2
		this is because once you are captive at palominos they nail you for everything .
		0
		the water sports come at a high price also .
		1
		in short , although the hotel grounds are neatly maintained and the view is spectacular , the accomodations , amenities and services are poor . another terrible thing was the uncooperative , and unfriendliness of the folks at th front desk .
		2
		they made little effort to accomodate or help resolve a situation .

		i stayed there this one time , but will not return .

		should have stayed somewhere else !
		1
		we stayed (4 people , two separate rooms ) at the el con july 8th - 11th on a business trip .
		0
		we had one ocean view room and one garden view room .
		0
		the garden view room was on the 6th floor and had , in my opinion , a pretty darn good view of the ocean .
		3
		for the money , it may not be worth the upgrade to an ocean view room if you can manage to get a garden view room on a top floor .
		1
		my girlfriend and i were in the ocean room .
		3
		the first one they put us in was right next to an elevator , so we requested a change .
		2
		the second room they put us in was right next to the funicular railway , which , by the way , runs all night !
		1
		you 'd think that if you request to be moved due to noise in the first place , that they would not put you right next to something else that 's equally as annoying .
		0
		that room was also next to a family with who knows how many kids whose primary goal in life was to slam doors and yell loudly .
		2
		we requested another move and were put on the other side of that particular wing in another ocean view room .
		4
		this time , we were not near anything noisy , and this room 's view far exceeded that of the first two .
		2
		clearly , the rooms here are not created equally .
		3
		speak up and get a nice one !
		0
		the bed in the ocean view room was really comfortable , but forget about the l shaped vinyl couch .
		2
		whoever came up with that idea should be fired .
		3
		overall we found the staff very pleasant , helpful , and accommodating .
		3
		we tried to sign up for a couple of the tours , but unless the hotel has enough people signed up , they wo not run them , which was disappointing .
		3
		luckily , we decided to rent a car for a day and go out on our own .
		1
		the rentals are cheap ( there 's an enterprise desk right next to the concierge ) , and this was the best decision we could have made .
		0
		a car offers infinitely more freedom on this island ( i did not see any public trans ) , and since this hotel is literally on top of a huge hill and far away from san juan , it 's the only way to escape - for example - to eat somewhere local and reasonably priced ( try el pasion if you 're looking for a good nearby restaurant ) .
		3
		with four people , we spent nearly half as much on the car/gas as we would have doing the hotel 's tours .
		3
		we also saw double the amount of attractions .
		1
		the most annoying thing about this place is that the beach is on an island and you have to take a boat out there to get to it .
		4
		we did not even bother doing this due to our schedule .
		1
		the last boat out there leaves at 3 pm and the last boat back to the hotel leaves at 5 pm .
		0
		at other hotels we visited during our business meeting , a beach was no more than a 2 minute walk from the hotel lobby ( e . g .
		3
		rio mar hotel near el yunque rainforest - as an aside , we swam at the beach here around 4 pm and it was amazing ) .
		1
		at el con , i guess you are just out of luck if you want to have a beer on the sand after 5 pm !
		2
		the pools are open 24 hours , though , but during the day were crowded to the point where i would not even really consider using them .
		0
		i wondered if half the people using them were even staying at the resort . the sting ray cafe offered delicious fine dining for around $50 a person not including drinks .
		2
		the other restaurants were overpriced and were acceptable otherwise .
		1
		i believe it 's much better to go into fajardo and find a local place instead .
		1
		overall , the place has amazing views .
		1
		it 's probably better for families than it is for couples .
		1
		if you want beach access without a huge hassle , do not stay here .
		2
		also , this place is better for those who do not want to travel around the island - those looking for the resort experience only .
		1
		the golf course looked great , too , although scorched in some parts .
		0
		also , the casino was a lot of fun , but for anyone who likes video poker , the pay table are awful (6/5 jacks or better ) .my advice would be to stay somewhere more centralized and wherever you stay , rent a car !

		" el con " is a singularly aproppriate nickname for hotel stayed at casitas section of hotel , privately owned apartments run by the hotel .

		the cons : 1) too much work to enjoy amenities/you have to take golf carts to main hotel , then go through complex to reach the vernacular to take you to the marina , then take a boat to the private island beach .

		the restaurants are outrageously expensive . wanted to order for a party of six three meals since not everybody wanted to eat a full course . they wanted to charge $ 20.00 per person sharing fee .

		while there are some ramps around , they fail to mark them with signs , so finding them requires extra walking , and that still does not ensure that you find an accessible route . the casino is extremely tacky and draws in many locals who seem to sit all day playing the 1 cent slots , and many chain smoke as they do so .
		0
		the penny slots are on the edge of the casino alongside the lobby , so you must pass by them to get to other places . if you decide to go anyway , make sure to go to the small infinity pool at the casitas - there 's a sign that it 's only for guests at the casitas , but they do not mind .
		3

		quite lovely . . .
		2
		you can also request that they give you a ride back to the main hotel at the end of the day , and they 'll pick you up in a golf cart type vehicle . one of the nicest places on the property is at the very bottom , beyond where the boat leaves to go to the island .

		they discourage you from staying at the rooms down there , as they say that you are 'too far ' from the rest of the hotel .
		2
		frankly , you 'd be right by the boat to the island , there are restaurants and a waterside bar and if you wish to go to the pool or the main hotel , you take the funicular up , instead of having to take it down to get to the aforementioned places .
		0
		it 's worth having a look at the photos posted by another recent traveller to the hotel - as we saw the same things - a lot of mold , dirt and disrepair . once they renovate it will be much nicer , i hope , but there will never be a real beach for those of you seeking a 'beach ' vacation .

		one thing to note is that the maids only change the linens and do not clean the bathroom .
		1
		we got a little sand in our tub , and it stayed with us for all 4 days that we were there . the pools are pretty but too small for the size of the resort .
		3
		you have to take a boat over to palomino island (25 min trip ) to get to the beach .
		3
		the island and beach are breath takingly beautiful , but the boat lines can get quite long and there only a small awning to wait under ; we stood in the blazing sun for almost an hour as there were so many people waiting that we watched two boats come and go .

		ok if you do not expect too much actually stayed at the adjoining las casitas villas .
		1
		the good : the villa is terrific for kids , with two double beds and a pullout queen size couch there is plenty of room .
		3
		the kitchen and ability to have the staff stock it in advance saves time and money and provides an element of relaxation that one ca not get in a cramped hotel room .
		2
		the views are fantastic and the property is generally clean .
		2
		the nearby marina offered some off - site local eating opportunities and a nice jumping off point for a bioluminescent lagoon tour .
		3

		a letter to my travel agent : tell customers to skip pr and elcon hi paulette , after enjoying old san juan for a day , i went to the el conquistador and i was really disappointed .
		2
		the pictures on the web made it look like it was a five star hotel one of the best in the world , but at best its a three star .
		3
		the rooms decor was a bit tired , the food ( even bar snacks ) was absurdly expensive and mediocre , the beach was a ten minute water taxi away , and the golf course booked up with convention delegates .
		2
		once you left the resort , you might as well have been driving around a place like lynn mass or lowell ; strip malls and burgher kings , dollar stores lots of traffic , not much to do except a walk in the rain forest .
		3
		so knowing that my temper and frustration level would rise quickly , no matter how much i tried to make the best of things at el con , i left pr after one day for saint thomas and st john where i spent an enjoyable three days at the westin hotel , a great place , thats extremely well designed , and run .

		overrated and overpriced just got back from six days in puerto rico .
		3
		the el conquistador did not meet our expectations in terms of their rooms and amenities .
		1
		so if you are expecting luxurious rooms - read on . . . we were booked for five nights but ended up staying only three . . . switched to the westin in rio grande which i highly recommend - they 've just been through an extensive renovation .
		1
		( this is something the elcon will be doing but it will take a few years - it used to be a wyndham resort - and was just bought by blackstone real estate group ) .the elcon did not tell us that mid - way through our stay that they had booked a huge broadcasting convention - and that wbls radio station ( in ny ) would be broadcasting shows and blaring music until 12:30-1am right outside our window for a few nights !
		1
		the whole point of the trip is that we had wanted to escape new york city and all its sounds .
		1
		when we first got to the resort - we ended up switching rooms 3 times ( something i 've never done ) but worth the effort .
		4
		first two rooms had broken lamps and shower rods and the bathrooms had dirty floors and showers with mildew stains on tiles and curtains .
		2
		the third room was in la vista area/wing of resort ( near spa ) -had a great view of palomino island but no amenities of any kind .
		0
		no bathrobes or turn down service and the beds honestly felt like cots .
		3
		at $359 a night for an ocean view room - i would definitely like amenities !
		0
		( also - very important , that does not include the extra $89.75 in resort tax and tariff fees they bill you at the end !
		3
		comes out to a whopping $448.75 a night .
		1
		for that you get a great view w/terrace - but not a great room .
		1
		food left little to be desired - very over priced and not that good overall .
		2
		ok , there are the negatives - here are the positives : palomino island - private island with breathtaking views and good beach ( free ferry shuttle from resort ) .
		1
		golf - excellent arthur hills golf course ( again very expensive for a round and rented clubs - and i think you should get at least free bottled water - which you do not ) but one of the most beautiful courses i 've ever played .
		3
		stingray restaurant ( down in marina area ) -expensive but worth it : great food , great atmosphere and view .
		1
		golden door spa - my friend said the deep tissue massage was intense and that they had a relaxing waterfall hot tub in the indoor spa area .
		3
		rainforest day tour ( not hiking one ) -get edwin as your tour guide and have a fun , lively trip ( roughly $99 for two people ) .
		1
		oh , one note - the elcon bioluminescence kayaking tour at night ( $133 for two people ) -is the one at laguna grande not vieques .
		1
		most of your time is spent paddling through the mangrove trees to get to the bay in complete darkness - and its rather difficult paddling against the current going back .
		3
		not for first time kayakers at all .
		4
		we own kayaks and found this trip challenging ( mostly because it was very difficult to see anything in the pitch black ) .
		2
		also , the time spent at the bioluminescence bay itself is roughly ten minutes .
		3
		very cool once you 're there to see the water light up around you .
		3
		the trip to vieques is the one most often highlighted in tour books but i do not believe the elcon offers that particular trip - or at least they did not when we were there .
		3
		ok - back to the positives : definitely go to the infinity pool by the casitas village at the resort .
		4
		go out to eat in fajardo - -either to lolita 's ( good mexican restaurant in fajardo/luquillos area ) or passyons ( great local spot with authentic pr cuisine nearby ) .
		3
		also , check out the elcon web site - as they do have promotions available with certain bookings that will save some money in the long run . . . but if you want to save $120 a night - i personally think the westin is the way to go .
		3
		it has ocean view rooms w/terraces - a private mile stretch of beach ( right off resort - no ferry service ) good room amenities ( westin heavenly beds and robes ) -2 golf courses ( rio mar cc ) and like elcon they had many different restaurants and a casino at the hotel .
		3
		also - there were no extra room tax and tariff rates and the rate included breakfast ( comparable if not better than the $50 buffet breakfast for two you got at elcon ) .
		0
		again , skip some of the restaurants at the westin ( palio was over priced and had just ok food ) and go to ones outside the resort .
		3
		we went to antojito 's ( right outside resort and down hill to the left ) -good local spot - w/good food - mofangos - reasonable and very friendly staff .
		1
		one downside of the resort is that their shuttle service to the golf area or tennis area was not reliable - no one seemed too concerned to get us to our tee time in time .
		3
		but at the westin you have breathtaking views of the rainforest and good views of the atlantic ocean and you are that much closer to old san juan if you want to take a day ( or night ) trip there .
		2
		love the ne/eastern side of puerto rico - but wish i had read a review like this before we booked our trip !

		1
		we decided on the resort also because most of the nicer resorts in san juan were booked . when we arrived early friday afternoon in puerto rico we were excited to see a bus awaiting to sweep us away to our carribbean resort .

		the bus ride took nearly two hours because we later found out we were in rush hour traffic .

		it seemed as if we would never get there and the bus ride twists and turns and is slightly nauseating .
		3
		upon arrival and check - in we were a little exhausted by the trip on the bus and then navigating around the resort and finally reaching our room .
		2
		the staff seemed very pleasant at the check - in desk and the bellhop was very helpful and delightful .
		1
		we settled into our room which was average in appearance and fair to average as far as cleanliness .
		4
		we dined at the stingray cafe and the fish entrees we had were delicious and the service was beyond amazing ! we were warm and muggy much of the time during the night , the air would not adjust to cooler .
		2
		my husband did a minor bathroom sink repair .
		1
		on saturday morning we awoke to discover the sheets twisted because there was a regular flat sheet instead of a fitted sheet on the bed .
		3
		saturday we rode the ferry over to the palomino island .
		0
		we hiked the entire island and we were a little disppointed in the majority of the island .
		3
		over much of the terrain near the populated beach it looked as though they were in the process of landscaping because there were tractor/bulldozer tracks .
		2
		we ate lunch at the outdoor iguana 's cafe and were a little preturbed at the constant pestering the roaming chickens gave us .
		1
		the food was average for cafe food .
		3
		the water at the main beach area and the surrounding ocean scenery was quite peaceful and beautiful .
		2
		the ferry ride to and from makes for a fun trip but slightly annoying when you think about it - why not just have a beach right at the resort area ?
		2
		also , the palomino island is apparently not a private beach but rather has quite a crowd of locals with loud music and large boats anchored right at the ferry drop off area .
		2
		we did not elect to do the horse back riding - i 'm not sure where all you could have ridden the horses , after scoping out the island it seems as though you would have had a medicore dirt trail ride with a short time on the beachfront .
		3
		we had some appetizer foods mid - afternoon at the bally - hoo bar and grill , food was good and the nice flat screen t . v . 's were nice for viewing the basketball games .
		3
		we ate at blossoms that night and the food was good , pricey though . we elected for room service for breakfast and the food was average but the price was a bit much .
		2
		the food was fresh but you could tell the long journey from the main resort area to our room mid - way down to the ocean was a long and tolling journey .
		1
		we returned back to the palomino island and enjoyed another day in the sun !
		1
		one of the definite highlights was the beautiful weather all four days we were there . the pool areas were average , although at the end of the day they looked pretty well beaten .
		2
		definitely not quite as crystal clear and dreamy as the pictures on the internet made it appear .
		2
		it seemed as though the el conquistador is trying to hard to be good at to many things and is left with being fair to average on most points .
		4
		on monday we left the hotel and check - out was more than depressing !
		1
		we found out just how much we were nickel and dimed and just how pricey it was .
		0
		there was a good bit of confusion on getting onto the bus . . . one of our bags was almost left behind ! we toured around monday in san juan and we thought it was beautiful and wished we had stayed in the san juan area ( which is right at the airport ) .
		2
		san juan looked more historic and charming whereas the el conquistador resort looked outdated and way to pricey for what you get . if we returned to puerto rico we would definitely elect to stay in san juan .
		1
		we would not recommend that anyone stay at the el conquistador based on quality and price .

		only kids age 4 and under are allowed to eat free .

		the rip tide in the area is bad and they even have signs posted on how to swim out of rip tides .

		westin rio mar - average at best my husband and i recently returned from a 1 week stay at westin rio mar .
		0
		my husband had a 4 day conference and we stayed on for 3 vacation days .
		1
		because it was for a conference , we did not have a choice in staying there .
		0
		based on reviews here , the location and the amenities offered , i honestly would not have selected this resort and after a 1 week stay , i would not recommend this resort to others . first things first , many people have stated and people still seem to be surprised so i will repeat it , the resort is a 30 minute drive from san juan and it can take up to 1 hour if there is traffic .
		3
		if you do not rent a car , you will be stuck at the resort and subject to poor service and average , overpriced food .
		0
		the positives : - i found the concierge helpful , particularly with off - site restaurant recommendations , the common areas of the resort are nice and i enjoyed the quiet pool .
		2
		the gym has decent equipment and the preplaced towel and water bottle at each machine is a nice touch .

		marbella 's is the restaurant that serves breakfast and the staff really push the buffet , which i found to be average .
		1
		the a la carte menu has a decent selection of standard breakfast items - but seriously , $6.00 for a small bowl of oatmeal ? ? $4.00 for 1 dannon yogurt ? ? $5.50 for a bowl of cornflakes ? ?
		3
		we had to repeatedly ask for drinks it was not unusual to wait at least an hour for our food to be served after we had ordered at coqui or by the pool .

		i was willing to overlook the negatives listed above , until the real negative emerged .

		the one that still grosses me out and was the absolute deal breaker for me is that there are in fact bed bugs .

		3
		the westin is pretty standard , what would you would expect .
		1
		there were some general complaints from the attendees i thought i would relate .
		2
		first , there is a daily $40.00 resort fee that is tacked on to the hotel rate , which most people thought was little high .
		1
		they charged $10.00 for a pina colada .
		1
		compared to the rest of the island , this is very expensive .
		3
		a glass of orange juice cost $5.50.
		3
		interestingly , despite charging a resort fee , there are signs stating swim in the ocean at your own risk .
		2
		there was a lifeguard stationed at the beach daily but clearly was just there for show .
		0
		i know this because , i experienced a near - drowing incident while there .
		0
		i 'm a fairly strong swimmer but got caught in the waves ; i yelled for help repeatedly but the lifeguard was too busy staring at the sand , and was not sitting in the designated lifeguard chair ; elevated , he might have noticed my distress .
		3
		fortunately , i managed to get to the shore but my situation could have ended badly .
		4
		i told the manager about the incident , but the days following , i noticed that the lifeguards showed little interest in watching the water .
		0
		comparatively the ocean villas were much nicer and with the availability of te kitchen , i thought was a much better deal .
		2
		the rates for these are as quoted and no hidden charges upon checking out .
		3
		unfortunately , this resort is very far from town and the airport ( $60.00 to airport , $80.00 one way to town ) .
		0
		we went to old san juan our last night , and realized it would have been nicer to be near old san juan with the multitude of restaurants , shops and cafes ; very quaint .
		1
		if you stay on the resort , you have little choice but to pay the exorbitant prices without a great deal of luxury which makes this hotel in my opinion overrated .

		3
		the weather last week was not great , which is obviously not anything that can be controlled , but i believe because of where it is on the island that is why we experienced so much rain .
		3
		we met a young man on the plane on the way home who had actually stayed at the hyatt villas and said they had 1 hour of rain the whole week , i 've traveled all over europe , the carribean , and the us and this is the one place i can say i will never return .

		it looks like a westin , but it does not feel like a westin beware : if you are used to good service , avoid at all costs ! an idea of what we 're used to : aman resorts , four seasons , ritz - carlton , grace bay club , other westinswe were expecting this level of service and food and decor and we were sorely disappointed on all counts except decor . the natural beauty was lovely and the hotel lobby was nice . check - in was smooth , but our room was a freezing 65 degrees when we got there and we could not see the ocean from our ocean - view room .
		3
		service at every restaurant visited was sometimes friendly and consistently bad , with the exception of the grill room , which did have pretty good service but the food was mediocre at best , and was way over - priced . in general , the worst thing about the hotel is that the food is not good and it 's not cheap .

		and the real treat is marbella . . . . . . . worst breakfast buffet i 've ever seen . . . .the hot food actually comes out cold ! and do not expect anyone to be sympathetic to your plight . . . .you know , cold pancakes with corn syrup , un - ripe fruit , bland bagels , nobody even notices you have been seated , and when they do , they still ignore you . . . .no , no , no management in the restaurant will be quite upset with you if you complain . . . . . well , what was the problem today maam ? !after complaining about these and many other detail type things , we received a room upgrade , which made our stay much more pleasant as the view was truly beautiful . . . . . (and i hate to say it , but it was noisy ) but the list is ever so long of things that ticked us off : rude management at the pool , unprofessional staff in general , late house - keeping service , embarrasingly bad wine lists , over - crowded , noisy , noisy , noisy , loud - speakers at the pool along with really bad music , dirty public restrooms , rude hostesses , a shower that has low pressure and is often cold , the hotel has that club - med kind of cheezy , trying to be fancy but not quite cutting it feel ( and the clientel to go with it ) . . .if the westin is going in this direction , they better cut the prices and change their name ! these may sound like petty complaints but at those prices , i do not wish to feel like i am part of a cattle herd ! !if you are looking for serene or elegant , do not bother . if you are looking for fine cuisine and excellent service , do not go to the westin rio mar ! if you are expecting to find your needs anticipated and to feel pampered and special , go elsewhere ! !in essence , it seems their goal is to herd in as many people as possible and get them to spend as much as possible .
		3
		it is a reactive - service oriented hotel , where complaining gets you upgrades , comped meals , etc but there is no apparent effort whatsoever to make things luxurious or wonderful for the guests without the guests specifically complaining about things ! i would never return to the westin rio mar and discerning guests are advised to avoid it if at all possible ! with 2 small children , all i wanted was to feel pampered and relaxed and really taken care of ( especially when spending thousands and thousands of dollars ) but what i got was stress and waiting and insults and chasing pool servers !

		paradisus review i had previously reviewed the paradisus punta cana and was critical of my stay there .
		1
		i am not going to review the resort again .
		0
		however i observed that any negative reviews are always marked as not helpful ( go back and see for yourself ) .
		0
		i can only assume the resort is trying to unfairly denounce negative reviews .
		3
		this is part of the problem with this resort - instead of trying to listen to constructive critism and make improvements , they would rather make anyone writing a negative review look like it is either poorly written or does not give very good information .
		4
		makes you wonder .
		0
		for this reason , i do not see any improvements being made to the resort .

		we arrived at the paradisus punta cana resort with high expectations .
		0
		last year we stayed at the paradisus in rivera maya mexico and had a wonderful time .
		1
		we were three couples .
		1
		one couple was promised a vip room and the other two were promised either the same building or one close to it .
		1
		the first room we were given was horrible .
		1
		we were all separated and each room had a very horrible smell of cleaning liquids ( i think ) - certainly not vip .
		0
		we moved within an hour into buildings far from the restaurant and beach area .
		0
		we were supposed to be located close to each .
		1
		we were then promised we could move the following day closer to the beach .
		1
		they claimed that they put us on the list for the room change . the day of the change we verified if we were on a list and told yes .
		1
		come back at 3 pm and it will be taken care of .
		0
		lo and behold we come back and are not on the list .
		1
		it took 2 hours before we could move .
		1
		the rooms we were given were not adequate nor close to the beach or vip as promised .
		0
		after an hour we finally received decent rooms but not before a lot of fighting and arguing . take note that this hotel does not cater to the american traveler .
		1
		they do not speak english unless the answer is no or involves money .
		0
		they are quick to take the all mighty dollar but also very quick to say no .
		0
		they do cater to the spanish visitor . pool and beachboth the pool and beach were wonderful saving the paradisus a terrible rating .
		3
		the beach water is clean and blue while the pool even though warm was pretty and large .
		0
		there were plenty of beach chairs and huts and the same goes for the pool .
		2
		there were people who left their empty drink cups on the pool edge and even in the pool but the staff did clean up .
		2
		towels were supposed to be ready by 8am and were never available until at least 10am .
		3
		using your towel card you were only allotted one towel .
		1
		when we arrived to ask for towels at 8 we were always told uno momento , that is their favorite phrase .
		3
		they were always lying to the guests .
		3
		if you asked for additional towels they would say no .
		0
		we were forced to take dirty towels from their towel bin and returned them for clean towels .
		0
		this way we were able to accumulate enough cards for the number of towels we needed .
		2
		they force you into being liars just like they are . grounds - they are well manicured and nicetransportation - you need a tram to get around .
		0
		they are not totally reliable .
		2
		one night we got out of the restaurant area around 11pm and waited 1/2 hour for a tram .
		2
		i called the office to be told uno momento .
		0
		after 15 minutes i called again and told another uno momento .
		3
		i told them we had a medical emergency and they will be sued unless we got a tram immediately - they responded within moments .
		3
		again , we were forced to lie . restaurants - many restaurants were closed for dinner including 3 nights in a row the buffet restaurant which should always be opened as a just in case .
		4
		most of the open restaurants required reservations which are nearly imposible to get and you are limited to the remaining open restaurants .
		0
		it was so bad one night that both the seafood and steak restaurant as well as buffet were all closed the same night , giving very little choice as to where to go .
		3
		the first day at the hotel we booked restuarants including the fuego twice .

		we went there only to be told it was closed for the week .
		2
		we were left with nothing after dressing for dinner .

		1
		however beware of the service .
		1
		at the seafood restaurant it took over an hour to get my soup .
		0
		they delivered 5 of the 6 main courses and would have forgotten all about thge last main dish if i did not go back to the kitchen and was forced at yelling at them .
		2
		finally , i got some action .
		0
		they were totally disorganized .
		4
		at the italian restaurant , 5 of 6 meals were delivered .
		0
		each time i aske about the last meal i was told uno momento .
		2
		it took 45 minutes for the last meal to arrive .
		3
		generally lousy service . breakfast and lunch buffets were fine ( i guess when you serve yourself you have less problems ) .housekeeping - i had to call every night for extra towels and the bar to be restocked .
		1
		terrible housekeeping .
		0
		once when i called for extra towals i was asked how many people in the room and why i needed them - how insulting .
		1
		please note that we were told by the beach towel folks to bring our room towels . our room was bug free but the other two rooms were crawling with ants and nothing was done to stem the ants . wake up calls - i set the clock to my verizon phone .
		1
		every day the wake up call was 15 minutes late .
		0
		we asked why and they had the audacity to say they had the correct time .
		0
		i could go on but the service was terrible .
		1
		we travel at least once and year and have been doing so for years - this was the worst service i ever experienced .
		0
		the staff did not care at all about the guests .
		0
		constantly lied to ( i went to the public relations desk and asked if the us newspapers arrived yet - which are 1 foot from his desk .
		0
		i was told no .
		1
		i look and there are the newspapers ) they will yes you and do nothing .
		0
		unwilling to give on any issue .
		0
		its their way or no way . i will never go back to this paradisus nor recommend it to anyone .
		3
		there are so many other islands and hotels to choose from that i do not have to accept their treatment .
		1
		incidentally , i spoke to many other us citizens who interestingly enough had the exact same feelings as me .
		0
		i would have questioned if it was just me but after speaking with others i knew this was a consistent issue with this hotel . i will not mention names of those who were very uncooperative but there were a couple of employees who were helpful and again saved the rating from being terrible .

		maggots in our food what is a vacation if you become sick ?
		1
		read as many reviews as possible and for those who have vacationed here who thought so highly of this resort , remember the buffet tables ?
		1
		the food sits out all day .
		1
		the restaraunts open at 7:00am so the food should be fresh and some foods chilled unless of course it sits out overnight ?
		2
		we always arrived at 6:45am to eat as the golf bus left at 7:05am .
		0
		i did not clue in until i found maggots in my prunes one morning and after this fear factor incident , i recalled that the fruit was never chilled .
		1
		the management placed the blame on the quality controls in the u . s . during import .

		1
		i , as well as one of our friends got locked out of our rooms for quite some time .

		there is no micro - management there , if you have a problem with one of the employees you are better off working around that problem then seeking to resolve it .

		the most amusing part of the whole trip was how fast we managed to check out and leave for the airport without any problems whatsoever !

		if you 're a non - smoker - stay away from his one ! ! just returned from a one - week stay at the bavaro princess and was very , very disappointed .
		0
		the resort bills itself as 5- star facility but barely makes 2 - and i give those 2 stars for the lush tropical landscaping .
		3
		this is a resort for smokers and/or people who have never been to a real 5- star resort ( or a 4- star or 3- star for that matter ) , and/or people with super - low expectations about their accomodations , food , and service . let me begin with what was good about the hotel : 1) lush tropical landscaping that is very well maintained .
		1
		wehn you go to a caribbean resort , this is what you want the grounds to look like .
		2
		if whoever does their landscaping and maintains their vast grounds ran the resort , it might be worth coming back to .2) beautiful beach .3)
		2
		large rooms .4)
		0
		nice , large , comfortable casino on the property which was empty on each of our two visits .
		0
		i would recommend a visit to the casino if only to take an air break as it seemed to be the only place in the entire resort with truly cold a/c .
		1
		a veteran of the bp told us the reason the casino was so empty is because the slots do not pay and he felt even the games were rigged .
		3
		he pointed out that there is little oversight of casinos in the dominican republic and certainly not the sort of regulation applied to casinos in the us .
		1
		i do not know about all that as we are not big gamblers .
		1
		we enjoyed our two hours of cool air at the casino .5)
		2
		friendly staff : most of the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful . why i would never go back to the bavaro princess :1) if you 're a non - smoker , as i am , keep away from this place .
		3
		smoking is not only permitted everywhere , it seems to almost be encouraged .
		3
		people smoke in the main dining room , in the restaurants , at the pool , in the pool , at the beach , in the water at the beach , on the trams , in the theater , and in their rooms .
		0
		there are no non - smoking rooms or public areas at this resort so a non - smoker is subjected to the disgusting stink of cigarettes virtually everywhere .
		3
		smokers think nothing of flicking their cigatettes anywhere they wish including on walkways , at the beach , in the pool area and from moving trams .
		0
		rooms are sectioned four to a building ( two up and two down ) and seem to share the air conditioning .
		1
		if you have a neighbor who smokes , the stink will be in your room as well .
		0
		there is no escaping cigartette smoke here .2)
		1
		i do not expect a whole heck of a lot when i go to a resort but i do expect air conditioning that works ( especially in a place where the temperture was routinely in the 80s -90s fahrenheit and the humidity was high to match ) .
		3
		the a/c in the rooms was marginal at best .
		0
		there is no such thing as 'cold ' air - the best you can hope for is 'cooler than outside . '
		2
		the main dining room , which is where you will do most of your eating , is an enormous building open at the sides with no air conditioning .
		4
		meals were sweat - fests .
		4
		a handful of restaurants on the property did have a/c but there , too , it was only enough to be better than outside .
		2
		if cold a/c is something you need to have a comfortable stay in a hot tropical locale , this is not the place for you .3)
		0
		when i travel , i also expect a comfortable place to sleep .
		4
		again , the rooms are large , but the lack of cold a/c and beds that were like sleeping on ironing boards made our stay very uncomfortable .
		3
		choice of beds is what they refer to as a twin ( smaller than what a twin would be in the us ) or a king ( more like a small us queen - size ) .
		0
		my 6'1 frame did not do well on the 3x6 'twin ' that was basically the size of an army cot but not nearly as comfortable .4)
		4
		this resort is spanish - owned .
		2
		do not expect us - type service nor employees who speak fluent english .
		0
		i speak spanish so it was not much of a problem for me , but i heard a number of american guests complain that they had problems being understood especially when it came to problems with their rooms or service .
		0
		the clientelle when we were there was largely spanish , argentinian , dominican , and russian with americans probably 5th in number followed by some german and french .
		0
		5) blankets provided were threadbare in spots and most of the towels we received during our stay were worn and frayed at the edges and should have been retired long ago .
		1
		there 's no excuse for worn - out blankets and towels .6)
		0
		when we arrived ( late - at about 10pm ) at our room , there was a slow leak in the line that runs from the wall into the toilet , spreading a line of water across the slick bathroom floor .
		0
		after almost breaking my neck slipping on the water , i called guest services .
		1
		the person who answered said that they were alone and that they would not be able to send a service person out until the next day .
		3
		the following day it took 3 calls over a four - hour period to get someone out to fix the leak .
		0
		the remote control for the tv did not work and a check revealed there were no batteries in it ; once turned on , the panel controls on the tv did not work and we could not turn the tv off .
		0
		we had to yank the plug to get it off and getting batteries for the remote and a tech to repair ( or replace ) the tv took the same 3 phone calls and 2 days .
		1
		when we returned to our room later that evening ( after a day at the beach and before dinner ) we found a half - drunk bottle of coke on a counter and one of the bottles of water in the fridge had been opened , partially drunk , and put back .
		0
		not exactly a 5- star hotel .7)
		0
		there are hokey shows in the theater each evening .
		2
		if you are expecting las vegas - style entertainment ( or even cruise - ship quality entertainment ) , this is not for you .
		2
		the theater is in the same building as the main dining room .
		1
		it also lacks a/c and was a smoke - filled , sweat box .
		4
		8) trams are necessary for all but the most hearty to navigate the resort .
		2
		our room was at the far end , away from the beach .
		2
		trams supposedly run 24 hours a day .
		1
		we found it nearly impossible to get a tram at the peak dinner hours and wound up walking to the dining room each evening .
		2
		again , bear in mind that people think nothing of smoking on these often - crowded trams ( and not a day went by that we did not see someone flicking their lit cigarette into the bushes from a moving tram ) .9)
		3
		there are two nice - sized pools on the property .
		1
		the main pool is close to the beach .
		3
		plenty of chairs and free pool towels are provided .
		1
		the main pool has a bar located inisde it that you can swim up to and order free beverages .
		3
		resort newbies seem to really like this feature .
		2
		the water temperture when we were there made the pool feel like a hot bath , which people seemed to enjoy ( i preferred the ocean ) .
		1
		what 's bad about the pool : there are no restrictions on children being in the pool .
		1
		we saw people with infants in pampers and were close - by at least one incident where a baby actually defacated into the pool .
		0
		as noted above , people smoke in the pool , putting their cigarettes out wherever it is most convenient for them anywhere nearby .
		3
		with its super warm temperature , many children and infants and many inconsiderate smokers , i found the pool unsanitary and not a place i would want to hang out and certainly not a place for kids to spend the day unless they 've had all their shots .10)
		1
		and speaking of kids - a note to americans thinking of bringing their children here : as this resort caters largely to europeans and south americans , a number of women were topless on the beach .
		0
		this seemed to be a big plus for the many 20- somethings vacationing from the usa but seemed to come as a surprise to americans there with their kids who found themselves doing some explaining they might not have expected .
		0
		10) food was a major disappointment .
		2
		most of your eating will be done in the large main dining room .
		0
		it is buffet - style and , as previously noted , it is a sweaty free - for - all .
		1
		while the buffet offered a wide selection of food , varied by theme each night , the food was mediocre at best .
		0
		the 'hot ' food was not placed on burners or under heat lamps and was cold for all but the first to get at it .
		2
		the cold food was not placed on ice or in refrigerated units so it was luke - warm by the time anyone who came later on in the meal got to it .
		1
		two of the restaurants we ate at did a good job with their meals : one was the japanese restaurant where guests sit benihana - style around a common table with the chef cooking in the center .
		0
		the chef was entertaining and the food was good .
		0
		the argentinian restaurant el gaucho did poorly on service but a good job with our argentinian steaks .
		1
		el gaucho is not air coniditioned .
		1
		for some bizarre reason , men are required to wear long pants to the restaurants which would be fine if they had adequate a/c .
		2
		el gaucho had none and the rest had only 'cool ' air at best .
		0
		women can come dressed as they wish , and many did .
		0
		so you men sweating in long pants sitting across from women in shorts .
		0
		go figure .
		0
		11) mangrove and zoo : the resort had , to its credit , preserved a natural mangrove area that is accessible by a short walking trail .
		1
		it is a nice touch and is great for the kids who get to see turtles and fish from the trail .
		2
		unfortunately the resort feels it necessary to keep a small 'zoo ' along the trail with a handful of cages housing birds and one for iguanas .
		0
		the enclosure for the vulture was way too small and none of the cages had clean water for the animals when we passed through - yes - we looked .
		2
		there is no security and while we were walking through some [ - - - - - - - ] and his rotten kids were throwing bread at the caged vulture which was obviously distressed by the harrassment .
		2
		the large iguana enlcosure had no foliage , shade or clean water when we passed by .
		1
		cruelty to animals is very unappealing to most americans .
		0
		the resort should do away with the zoo and just have the natural mangrove trail .
		2
		it is pretty enough without mistreating any birds or other animals .
		2
		conclusion : nice tropical setting , beautiful landscaping ; nice beach ; big rooms ; mostly nice , friendly staff .
		2
		bad a/c , bad beds , unsanitary pool , smokers and smoking everywhere , poor food .
		1
		as i said in the beginning : this is a resort for smokers and/or people who have never been to a real 5- star resort ( or a 4- star or 3- star for that matter ) , and/or people with super - low expectations about their accomodations , food , and service .

		you are on vacation , and are supposed to be able to relax , but , you cannot , if you want to get into a decent resturant .3.

		the food is awful , and that is true of the buffet and resturants !

		it took us three days back in new york for her to get back to normal .
		1
		as a juvenile diabetic , this was not an ideal situation for her . so to sum it up , if you only care about an inexpensive price , and an amazing beach , you may actually like this place .
		4
		but if good food and service are important , stay very , very far away from here .
		0
		be prepared for illness , as i have a feeling that the water is the cause .

		while punta cana was , indeed , one of the most beautiful beaches i have ever experienced , i will not go back until the quality and service can be much improved !

		the most beautiful place . . . but i would not return we stayed at the bavaro princess quite some time ago , march 2006 to be exact , but never did get around to writing a review .
		2
		from time to time i always check out the reviews  pictures of this property , and am always surprised that the same complaint still keeps popping up . . . that is food poisoning .
		2
		that is what prompted me to finally write this review .
		1
		i had thoroughly researched this hotel for approx . 1 year before booking  the reviews were mostly good .
		0
		we booked through air canada vacations .
		4
		about 2 months before we left , reviews started showing up regarding food poisoning , which made me very nervous .
		1
		even waiting at the airport after check - in i was extremely worried , but other travellers i talked to said to just go  enjoy , all will be fine . we stayed for 2 weeks , and we upgraded to an oceanfront platinum club room , which i believe is well worth the price .
		0
		we had a beautiful room with a huge terrace , with a view to die for and only 75 steps to the beach .
		0
		there was no signs of neglect that i could see , and no bugs in the room .
		3
		and just the convenience of not having to wait in that line up to book your reservations was worth it . . . .it was a breeze .
		3
		all the staff at the platinum lounge were friendly  helpful , anna at the bar was great  made the best cocolocos , and a special thank - you to elso of turinter tours , who on our last night there personally picked us up in his car  showed us some dominican nightlife . . . he took us for pizza , and then to a bar/bowling alley/pool hall  we shot pool .
		1
		i spoke to the air canada rep down there about the food poisoning issue and even showed her the reviews on ta , and she assured us not to worry . as other reviewers have said , the beach is gorgeous .
		2
		in fact , it is one of the most beautiful beaches we have been to .
		1
		we had fun playing in the waves and walking the beach .
		0
		at night after dinner we would usually take a couple of beers to the beach  lay on a chair  just look at the stars and listen to the ocean .
		2
		it was heaven .
		1
		the resort grounds are beautiful .
		4
		we never took the trams anywhere , we always walked as it was too pretty to be zipping around through the property .
		2
		the mangrove  jungle in the middle was gorgeous . . . .one night that sticks out is when we walked back from licey through that area around 10ish ; the temperature was perfect  the moon was full .
		1
		it was a storybook moment ! we did not do any night shows ; i happened to see bits  pieces of the shows but they did not interest us , after all the beach at night was beckoning us .
		2
		we did some tours : the caving tour was fabulous , i highly recommend it .
		3
		we did the jeep safari . . . it was very interesting .
		4
		we also did the swim in the marinarium one sunday afternoon . . . i did think this one was rather lame .
		2
		we also went to saona ( gorgeous ) and sunset horseback riding which was also good . i have wonderful , fond memories of the beauty of this resort , but the one thing that marred our vacation was the food .
		1
		this is a huge problem here .
		1
		after worrying so much , the first week went off good .
		2
		we ate at the all the restaurants .
		3
		we basically stayed with food we knew , just to be cautious .
		3
		the food was okay , the pasta stations were good .
		2
		the italian restaurant was my favourite , and the buffets were good , but the gourmet licey i was not impressed with .
		1
		el gaucho was just plain terrible ; my husband 's steak looked like shoe leather , the buns were as hard as baseballs , and i was served a tiny baked potato and a pile of steamed onions . . . .blah !
		0
		the rest of the food was good , but midway through week two , my husband did not feel well .
		0
		we tried to tell ourselves maybe he was in the sun too long  suffered heat stroke or something along that line , but it just got worse  worse .
		2
		he could not leave the room  was in the bathroom 95% of the time .
		1
		finally after 2 days , he went to the doctor ( who is very nice ) , but we had to wait in a line because he was not the only one who was suffering from . .you guessed it . . . . food poisoning .
		2
		she put him on an iv because he was so dehydrated  gave him pills to take , which settled his stomach enough that we could go out with elso on our last night there , although my husband had no appetite for the pizza .
		1
		so the last five days were a write off .
		0
		when we arrived home , my husband did not feel right for the next 2 weeks . . . . . it was just wicked , he has never been so sick in his life .
		1
		because there were so many people with food poisoning , the next day i saw a food inspector there  all the food staff were wearing face masks .
		0
		i told the hotel of our misfortune , and they sent us up milk  bananas ( i guess to try  soothe his stomach ) .
		2
		on a side note , i did not get food poisoning . . . but i do not eat meat , whereas my husband did .
		0
		however , it is very hard to pinpoint where the source of the bug is as this is just such a huge resort with so much staff , it could be anything . that is my experience with this resort , and i am surprised that they are still having problems here .
		2
		before we left i told myself that the people who complained were just being picky , or liked to complain about something everyday , or overindulged in alcohol or the like , but even though we were worried , i gave the resort the benefit of the doubt .
		2
		this is what happened , so those who have experienced this are not fabricating it  just to complain . . . . it does exist here so just be cautious . in retrospect , i feel bittersweet about the bavaro , that is why i come back here sometimes to look at the pictures  read the reviews . . . . it does bring back good memories of the natural beauty of the resort , and i really do miss that . . .walking through the grounds  the beach at night  the gorgeous countryside .
		0
		however , we will never return to this resort , nor the dominican for that matter as the food quality is questionable and let 's face it . . . .food poisoning on a vacation is not fun at any expense !
		2
		just my two cents . . . .finally !

		0
		alot of people may seem to post only negative things about this resort .
		1
		i agree with most of them , but this resort did have some good points as well .
		0
		let me just say , however , that i would not recommend this resort .
		1
		i have stayed in punta cana twice before , once at the grand palladium , and once at iberostar punta cana , both of which were much , much nicer that the bavaro princess .

		here goes : check - in : not bad .

		as usual , we got there about 11 a . m . , and no rooms until 3 p . m . i 've just gotten used to this i guess . rooms : first of all , i must mention that we did have a traveler with us that needed handicapped assistance , such as a handicapped room .
		2
		this resort did not offer handicapped rooms , though , when we booked , apple vacations did say that they had handicapped rooms .

		i wo not say any more ! beach/pools : gorgeous ! food : out of the 3 resorts i 've stayed at in punta cana , bavaro princess had the best food !
		1
		lots of selection .
		0
		beverages : all domestic liquor .
		2
		beer ok .
		4
		just a side note . . . iberostar offers imported liquor . . . tanqueray , beefeater , canadian club , bacardi , absolut , etc . alcoholic beverages were not bad at princess , but i 've had better at other resorts . resort in general : very , very large , though the tram does make frequent stops at all destinations , and is easy to pick up . casino : not las vegas , but fun .

		the room was slightly small but we hardly in the room so it was not a major problem .

		the plumbing was loud , the room was tiny , the window opened onto a metal maze of a fire escape , the umbrella broke as soon as we opened it , and the lobby bar was the least appealing place in the city .

		friendly hotel but small rooms we prefer smaller hotels and normally stay in them when we are visiting a city .
		3
		for this reason and based on the glowing reports on tripadvisor , we selected the chancellor hotel for our recent 5 night stay .
		4
		while we found the staff to be particularly friendly and the cookies in the lobby a nice treat , we found our room - -and especially our bath - -to be unusually small .
		4
		you had to adjust your knees to close the door when you were sitting on the toilet !
		4
		the hotel appears to cater to traveling groups because every morning the lobby was completely closed off for a breakfast for a group of danish visitors with only a narrow passage available to reach the front desk or door .
		0
		and , this may sound picky , but a group of art students staying at the hotel ( the dining room was closed off for them in the mornings ) would congregate at the entrance of the hotel to smoke , making entering and exiting particularly challenging .
		4
		on a possitive note , the location and value are excellent and while i might not stay there again i would not discourage someone else from doing so but would like them to be aware of the shortcomings .

		lovely hotel we stayed their , 27- feb -05 for 4 nights and the hotel is gorgeous , our room was extreamley clean , the decor was nice and modern ( plain/fresh looking ) and the location is 2nd to none ! ! we had a brilliant stay in san francisco only one night when we went out we had our wallet stolen , which ment we had to cancel all of our credit cards and had very little cash on us , anyway as soon as this happened i went to the front desk to make them aware that if they have not yet already taken the money of off my card that now it will proberbly will not work as i had to cancel them all , basically the hotel people didnt ask if we were ok they just wanted to know how we were going to settle our bill , i think that this was most unconsiderable , as we were thousands of miles away from home with no food , no money and all the hotel cared about was me settling the bill , i mean its not like i couldnt of settled it at a later date .

		they had all my details so it was not like i was trying to get out of paying .

		thanks for everything as i was a very nice stay , but i think you should take note of what i have said as this could happen to another customer and if they was not lucky like us , i mean getting money the next day then i dont know what we would have done as you didnt look like you wanted to help us at all

		it is a standard ritz property .

		it is nice , but nothing spectacular .

		4

		my husband got frustrated and tried to set them up , but no dice .
		0
		the chairs are chained together so you ca not have self service .
		2
		the beach was nice and the water was nice and not rocky .
		0
		we enjoyed it .
		1
		i would not recommend ordering food and drinks at the beach .
		3
		we ordered lunch and drinks and they did not even bring a little side table !
		2
		we just came back from swimming and our drinks were sitting in the sand ! we had room service and beach side service .

		yes , the food is expensive - this is the ritz .
		0
		my husband claims the burgers were awesome , though and never complained about the price tag .

		my food was good , too .
		1
		nothing fabulous , but very good food .
		1
		the property is far away from anything but a few other beach hotels .
		2
		it is indeed about 50 usd roundtrip into old san juan .
		2
		i did not like this too much .
		1
		the casino is pretty small .
		0
		i do not gamble , but plenty in our group did .
		3
		they all said it was small , but the workers were friendly and they had a good time . there is definitely some miscommunication on the activities among the staff .
		3
		i called the front desk at 6am to try to book the snorkeling trip i learned some friends were on for that day .
		3
		i knew it left at 8.30 and wanted to see if there were spots avialable .
		0
		every time i called , i would be told the activity desk opened a half - hour later .

		at 6, it opened at 6.30.
		0
		at 7, it opened at 7.30.
		0
		at 7.30, it opened at 8! i refused to hang up at 7.30 and demanded that someone help me .
		0
		finally , fifteen minutes later , i was called by the concierge and informed that i had tickets to snorkeling . he said he had been there since 7am and could have helped me .
		0
		this kind of miscommuniation is inexcusable at a property like this ! lastly , our plane was due to leave at 4pm the day we checked out .
		0
		we called to get late check out - even asked to pay for late check out - and were rudely informed that our rate was already super cheap and late checkout was not avaialble to us .
		1
		once again , i complained quite a bit and was able to get late check out (2pm ) for an additional 100 usd .
		1
		with the money my work spent on alcohol alone at this place ( ! ) i think they made enough money off of us to not be so rude . to sum it up , the property is standard ritz - which is of course nice ! the beach is very nice .
		1
		the location is very out of the way - close only to the airport ( which was not too noisy for us .
		0
		yes , you could hear planes on the beach , so do not stay here if you want the deserted tropical oasis feel ) .
		3
		the staff was generally helpful , but at times uninformed and twice rude !
		3
		i would not complain if i stayed there again , but i would not run to it either .

		3
		the property was extremely crowded , trying to find a seat at the pool was quite a challenge .
		3
		i found service to be extremely slow and almost non - existent by the pool .
		1
		the hotel was very clean but just not quite what you would expect from a ritz .

		50 minute massage with tip $171.
		2
		the beach is okay , it happened to be extremely windy while we were there so you were getting whipped in the face with sand most of the time .

		we were prepared to be pampered at the ritz , but our experience was average .
		0
		i absolutely felt that the rc paid special attention to the older guests , and my husband and i are in our mid 20's .

		sure this was not the end of the world , its just not why you pay for the ritz .
		0
		there was also a fire drill , which apparently we should have been warned about via a letter in our room , but we were not .

		2
		i love to be in the sun , and he loves the shade , so they always set up an umbrella nearby for him .

		i highly recommend lunch on the beach , delivered to your chairs !
		1
		much of the pool stays shaded during parts of the day , so the beach was the better bet . other service was so - so .
		3
		no one seemed to know what dinner recommendations to make , and our maid never restocked our bathroom properly , despite the supposed twice a day service .
		2
		overall , we were prepared to pay more at the ritz , but did not really feel like we got more .

		great food  we were here for a company retreat and would not have usually chosen this type of location for a vacation .
		0
		we typically prefer beaches that are less commercial and built - up .
		2
		however , if you are visiting san juan for business or to see family , then this would be a nice place to stay .
		4
		the positives : the food and service were very good .
		3
		they handled our large group well .
		1
		i have stayed at many ritz carlton properties before and these aspects of our stay definitely lived up to ritz standards .
		2
		the negatives : yes the rooms are luxurious , well kept and clean , and have all the amenities of a 5 star hotel , however , they do not make you feel like you are at the beach .
		4
		these rooms are decorated as if they could be practically anywhere and do not open - up to nature .
		1
		it seems that ritz carltons tend to do this while four seasons usually make their properties fit with the environment and location better .
		0
		although in this setting ( a built - up beach ) there is not really anything to open - up to .
		1
		the ritz definitely feels more like a hotel rather than a resort so it depends on what you are looking for . overall , a good place for a company retreat or convention , but not a place for a caribbean vacation .

		not great . . . not bad 3.5 out of 5. i booked this hotel directly b/c there were not many bargains online .
		2
		this trip was my honeymoon and we checked in on my 30th birthday .

		i can honestly say , it is the best hotel in the area .
		0
		i visitied a few others hotels that were on the same beach and a few others near the hilton .

		the food and drinks were really good , but very very expensive3.

		they have a huge mall plaza las americas with every store you can imagine .
		3
		everyone was able to speak english , even in the mall and surrounding storescons :1.
		3
		there was construction going on and it was right next to my room .
		2
		it was so loud that we had to leave the room during the day .
		3
		it started around 9:15am and ended around 4pm . . . so no sleeping late .
		0
		the hotel offered to move me to a jr .
		0
		suite with no balcony .
		0
		i declined .2.
		1
		the taxi 's are a rip - off and the bellmen conspire with them .
		1
		a taxi is a minimum of $10 each way .
		3
		just walk , unless going to the mall or airport .
		0
		do not pay more than $17 each way for the mall .
		3
		they will try to rip you off for $20 each way3.

		the beach was blah .
		1
		the water is not beautiful .
		0
		it had a funny smell .4.
		1
		if you ca not swim , motorized water sports are out .
		2
		you have to swim all the way out to the rope just to get on a jet ski or any motorized activity .
		2
		i could not swim all the way out there and had to cancel my jet ski . . .5.
		1
		the walls are paper thin .
		2
		the people next door walked in and out of their room non - stop . . . and their door would slam shut and vibrate our bed .
		2
		so imagine hearing a loud slamming noise at 3am . . . i almost had a heart attack !
		3
		so between the slamming doors and the construction jack - hammer , i was ready to scream .6.
		0
		the food at the hotel is overpriced .
		2
		taxes and gratuity add to the outlandish prices .
		1
		one night we paid 125 for dinner and i only had one drink .
		2
		that 's crazy .7.

		old san juan is filthy .

		several guests were glad to get back from that tour .

		i did not even want to breathe in old san juan .

		4
		in sum : as previously mentioned , this was the best hotel in pr .
		1
		so i 'd hate to see what the vacation experience is like at the other hotels .
		0
		i stayed for 6 days and my hotel bill was 2650.

		for the money we spent , over 3500, we could have gone somewhere much nicer .

		from a child - friendly perspective , they should take a cue from the 4seasons this resort touts itself as child friendly and does have some amenities for children .
		1
		however they do not go the extra step like the four seasons .
		1
		for example , the four seasons provides diapers , swim diapers , baby floats , toys , and most important , strollers .
		1
		this makes travelling extremely easy - - you need a car seat stroller to fly , so it 's so nice to be able to avoid bringing a second one for the beach/pool .
		3
		of course , the four seasons charges a resort fee too - - but it 's the convenience of having those items that make it worth it . i had been corresponding with the ritz about these items for weeks in advance of my trip and did not get a straight answer as to what they can provide or not .
		4
		responses are very vague , which makes it quite difficult to pack .
		0
		if i were them , i would take a cue from the 4s , spend a few hundred dollars on a handful of strollers and baby amenities and advertise it as a convenience .
		1
		as of now , i will go back to the 4s where it 's quite clear what they provide and it is very easy to travel with children .

		please , just increase the price of the room .

		it 's not fair to business travelers , who may not use the pool , and not fair to people who expect some decent service out of their 10% ( $60+ ) .
		4
		the pool staff could not be bothered to set up a chair , no one came around to give water much less drinks , etc , etc . please , just charge it as part of the cost of the room , and then make your workers actually work for the possibility that they might get tips for doing what should be their jobs .

		it was not bad , except at the restaurants , but it was not 4/5 star either .

		0
		first of all i would not recommend staying in this area , you 're a stones throw away from the airport so while relaxing on the beach you hear the jets taking off and landing .
		3
		it was a late honeymoon for us and we 'd just found out we were expecting and our rate was 710.00 a night and we had read some posts about the hotel being so good at upgrading on special occasions but nothing - we had a view of the airport and the parking lot .

		the service at the hotel was definately excellent and if you have money to throw away i guess you 'd think it was worth it , but for 700.00 a night plus a 10% resort fee you 'd think you 'd just get something worthwhile there .

		disappointing for the ritz after 4 days in vieques ( which i later learned that culebra has the better beaches ) , the ritz was a bit of a let down .
		4
		impeccable service and the rooms were very nice and comfortable . . . .but something was missing to make it more than an average experience .
		1
		it 's near the airport so be prepared to talk loud when the 757's are at full throttle across the street .
		1
		while the beaches are nice ( but nothing compared to vieques ) , it was over - crowded , hard to find a seat and way too many kids running around .
		1
		it was like day care by the pool . . . not my scene .
		2
		romantic couples who want peace and quiet and a bit of privacy should either head over to the vieques , culebra or some other island or find a high - end boutique hotel in/near old san juan ( which was the highlight of that part of the trip .
		1
		again , the service was outstanding and everyone went out of their way to make the stay enjoyable .

		ritz - - -not worth full price we visited the ritz in early december , and were able to take advantage of pre - season rates , which made the stay worth what we paid when booking a deal which we did via this site and expedia .
		3
		but travelers doing so must be aware of the added 20% or so to any room rate with the combined taxes and resort fee which we discovered were added after we booked the room on the site . were we to have paid top rate , i would have been very disappointed in our ritz experience .
		3
		while staff and service were top - notch , the pool is crowded with beach chairs and with a predominantly new york clientele , many of whom speak loudly on cell phones disturbing the peace that most people seek on vacations . the beach is a better choice , and while the surf is a often a bit rough , beach chairs can be moved to more quiet locations . most rooms have no balconies , so one cannot enjoy relaxing privately outside while enjoying the tropical sunset . we did enjoy lunches at the poolside restaurant , which were extremely well - prepared and generous in portion , though very pricey .

		very good but . . . my wife and i went to the ritz dec 11 to dec 18.
		1
		we decided on it because she is 3 months pregnant and we wanted something easier to get too . good points - easy access .
		3
		from the mainland us puerto rico is an easy flight with a great deal flexibility .
		1
		it is a very easy trip to the airport , just a 5 minute ride ( watch the cabbies we were informed it shoul dbe an $8 cab ride but we were charged $18 going and $14 going back ) .easy to keep in touch .
		3
		my blackberry worked and us cell phones worked there .
		3
		if someone wants to go away and be able to easily keep in touch with work , this place is great for it .
		1
		the hotel also gets all us tv stations so you can even keep up with your favorite shows . nice pool area - the pool area was really nice and very realxing .
		0
		the chairs are those nice ones with the padding .
		3
		on any given day many people were taking naps and it was a mellow relaxed atmosphere .
		2
		there is a great deal of shade in the pool area between the palm trees and the hotel itself .
		4
		when we wanted more sun , we went to the sunnier beach . service - the concierge was great .

		they recommneded restaurants , made reservations etc . .
		2
		in general the staff was great except at the restaurants .

		they were clueless and slow for breakfast and lunch .
		1
		we did not eat at the vineyard ( the fancy restaurant ) it was closed while we were there . bad pointsthe beach - in general the beach area was just ok .
		3
		it was not the nice exotic looking beaches that one sees in other parts of the caribbean .
		0
		my wife and i enjoy taking long strolls on the beach and it was just not that nice . value - we had a very nice time but i did not think the cost of the trip was really worth it .
		0
		we go the caribbean every year and i tohught we got better value in everything from the trip to dinners elsewhere . good to know - location - the hotel is literally next to airport .
		3
		it is convenient but you hear and see every plane take off .
		1
		that diminishes from the ambiance a great deal .
		0
		this is also not an exotic locale by any means .
		2
		the hotel is in an urban area close to the airport that just happens to be on the beach .
		1
		the el san juan is a 5 minute walk and the interconital a 10 minute walk .
		3
		the el san juan has an interesting scene on friday and saturday nights .
		2
		while the hotel is an an urban area outside of the restaurants in the hotels , there are no restaurants recommneded by the hotel within walking distance ( there is a local one but anywhere you can get a steak for 9.99 makes me scared . )
		4
		anyway cabs can add up from there , we spent over $130 on cabs while in pr and that was just trips to the airport , condado ( $14) , old san juan ( $16) and a few other local ones . restaurants - in general were good but not great .

		not the best option . . . my fiance and i stayed 4 nights at el con , along with two of my siblings .
		4
		the decor was too cute .
		2
		my room came with a balcony and a great view .
		0
		the bathrooms and walk - in closets were perfect .
		3
		however , my brother 's room had a horrid view ( what a pale concrete wall ) , and they would not improve the room , despite the fact that the hotel was not bustling at full - occupancy .
		3
		this was my brother 's fifth time in pr , and undoubtedly , his only stay at el con .
		1
		the pools were beautiful . everything seemed to be an inconvenience .
		4
		the resort was incredibly far from the airport and night life in san juan or loiza .
		1
		you 'll be driving/riding for at least 1 hr .
		0
		the caves ( which are a big tourist attraction in pr ) is 1.5 - 2 hrs away .
		0
		breakfast buffet was $25 per person plus tax with no traditional pr fare .
		3
		to get to the beach , you had to take the elevator to the lower level , walk across the back of the hotel , take the tram down the mountain , show your hotel id to get an id bracelet in order to wait on the dock for the ferry to take you on a 15 minute ride to palomino island - - and the ferry only runs on the hour .
		1
		the latest you can stay on the beach/palomino island is 5:30p .
		3
		what kind of nonsense is that ? ! it 's still nice outside at 5p .
		3

		the alcoholic drinks on the island were nasty , expensive ( $8 for a 12 oz .
		1
		frozen pina colada from a machine ) and weak ( are you sure that 's rum ? ) .
		3
		to add to one 's inconvenience , the self - parking at $15/day was a joke , and it was a hike to get there to/from the lobby .
		2
		yes , they had a shuttle to take you to the self - parking lot , but it ran sporadically , and one of the primary drivers was rude and consistantly mia .
		0
		you could be waiting for 20 mins .
		2
		plus , you had to keep getting the cheap paper tix validated at parking services , instead of them just giving you a key card to come and go .

		3
		was there on a company retreat .

		weather was not great , windy , overcast and at times rainy .
		2
		the resort was ok but far from great .
		1
		its actaully divided up into several different areas that are spread out across their property . . . really spread out .
		1
		we stayed in the part of the resort down by the marina .
		1
		rooms were fine , nothing special but clean and nicely appointed . would suggest that you get a room on the top floor at the marina so that you get high ceilings , and one thats on the corner so that you get an extra window .
		1
		each room had a dvd player and a nice lcd tv .
		3
		( had to unplug the dvd video cable from the tv to get the tv to show channels and the remote was missing batteries when we got there . )
		2
		the rooms each have a balcony which was great for sitting and having a glass of wine at the end of the day .
		0
		i suggest buying a bottle/and or snacks at one of the many general stores instead of the restaraunt/bar . .the rooms each have fridges that you can use to put what ever you buy . - but no snacks or drinks were in the room .
		3
		( these could have been removed by my company ?
		3
		) the draw back to the marina was that in order to get to the main part of the hotel you needed to take a tram up from the seaside level the top level , then walk a long hall way to an elevator to the main hotel . . . sound like alot ?
		2
		the positives are that you are down on the water and by the water park and the boat that takes you to the resort 's private beach island .
		1
		if you are up top , it takes a long tme to get to these attractions . in short , the resort was ok , good for a company event as it has everything a big company event needs , but its really lacking in charm , charater and the layout leaves a lot to be desired .

		we found we had to wait in line for just about everything , from the funnicular that takes you from the top of the hotel to the marina to the ferry that takes you to the only accessible beach on the private island off shore .
		1
		in my opinion , the nicest place to swim in the water on the island appears to be reserved for private boaters coming in for the day .
		3
		there are no beach chairs in that direction , so they are definately directing the masses to the shallow , windy and more rocky side of the beach .

		3
		if you have a car , you can stop at one of the local grocery stores and buy snacks  things .

		you can walk down to the little marina town just outside of the hotel  buy beer for less than $1 per can ( beers (10 oz cans ) are over $5 each at the resort ) .
		3
		you can get ice at the machines near most rooms .
		3
		there are small refridgerators in each room , so you do have somewhere to store snacks .

		suggestions : rent a car and travel around the island .

		we rented a car in advance from enterprise about 4 months before our trip . . . we got a great rate ( $150 for the week for an economy car ) .

		they were renting for $59 a day if you rented at the hotel .

		1
		that said , trying to get to the beach requires getting on a cable car and then catching a water taxi to palomino island .
		3
		if you want to go to the beach , give yourself 30-45 minutes to get there as the hotel has 2 of these cable car type buggys and one has been broken for weeks so everyone has to use just one .

		beatiful resort that needs to work some major issues there have been enough reviews of this hotel ( seemingly mostly negative ) for anyone reading these posts to make their own opinion on whether they want to stay at this resort .
		3
		i just wanted to add my 2 cents as i have family that regularly stays in the casitas area of the resort and let me in on some information that any new guests should know . first , this is no longer a wyndham property it has been bought by a company called blackstone ( i am not familiar with them at all ) and the resort is going through a major transition .
		1
		please keep this in mind when making your reservations .
		1
		i made my reservations for this resort back in may as an american express promotional ; through the wyndham reservations hotline and had a difficult time with wyndham customer service once i checked into the resort .
		0
		i had reserved an oceanview room and upon check in i had a lovely view of the tennis courts , also once the luggage was delivered to the room there was white paint on one of the pieces and to put the icing on the cake i did not get the wyndham by request amenities in the room as promised .
		0
		i tried to resolve these issues with the management of the hotel but i got a frustrating run around ultimately only being able to leave a voicemail to a generic voice mail box as the resort manager could not be found .
		4
		once i ran into the brick wall of no customer service or satisfaction - i called the wyndham 800 number directly and receieved no help and i mean nothing !
		0
		i was told since the resort had been transferred to new owners only 2 days prior to my arrival they would not be able to do anything for me .
		0
		this made me extremely angry since this was not communicated to me at anytime prior to arrival to this resort .
		0
		wyndham gladly took my money for these reservations ( i had to put down a 2 day deposit via my credit card ) and kindly said i was sol .
		0
		i will never stay at another wyndham property because of this - i will gladly put my money towards other chains in the future . not to bore you with the details - it all eventually worked out once security got involved to help me with my problem with the paint on my suitcase .
		0
		the security manager saw how upset i was ( and i was also on the phone with american express to try to stay at another hotel ) moved me to an oceanview room and cleaned up my bag - thanks again felipe !
		1
		once i actually got a manager i even got my wyndham by request amenities but this was a day later . i hope that the new owners will restore this property to the glory that it once was because this truly is a lovely location for a resort .

		mediocre i would have to say our time at rio mar was pretty decent overall .
		2
		after reading some of the reviews on here , i knew where to go and what not to do .
		2
		since our package included airport transfers , this was great so we didn?? have to scramble or pay the ridiculous 30/trip/person .
		3
		the van provided by the hotel was nice and clean , but smelled a bit funky .
		0
		a/c was on full blast and the drive was about 35 minutes to the hotel around midnight . we did sign up from the wyndham rewards before we departed and this is a must !
		3
		they are able to offer you free in - room internet , a welcome package of babybel cheese , crackers , two sodas , and bottled water the first night .
		0
		the internet is removed when you check out , so make sure to have them do it .
		4
		unfortunately our package did not include continental breakfast , but when we checked in , they said we did , so it was annoying having to dispute this at the end .
		3
		as far as the fridge goes , they informed us they used to have minibars , but they removed them recently .
		1
		having heard this , we opted for the fridge for $25 for our whole stay .
		1
		they failed to mention the fridge of the minibar was still in the room , so we had this charge removed at the end of our stay as well .
		3
		unfortunately , they were not too friendly when we were checking out since we had a few charges to dispute .

		it?? not like it?? coming out of their pockets ! we realized their concierge staff was hit or miss .
		1
		one didn?? even speak english that well and directed us to go to seven seas beach in fajardo when it was closed on monday .
		4
		it seems most beaches are closed on this day in pr .
		3
		luquillo beach right east of rio grande was closed as well , but we parked at the kiosks and walked on over after our meal at kiosk #60. kiosk #60 had some really good super - sized empandas filled with beef or chicken .
		1
		we also purchased a dollar of braised pork chunks , and a side of rice and beans .
		3
		pretty good overall !
		0
		the hotel did suggest going to la parilla , but we thought it was going to be tourist - laden , so we opted for #60 per our employee at enterprise rental .
		3
		rio mar is a good drive from san juan , but we booked our rental car via enterprise in fajardo online .
		3
		we were picked up from our hotel since they offer ??e??l pick you up service? ? and
		3
		this was great since it ended up being only $60 for five days !
		3
		rio mar offers avis on site , but they of course were not able to beat our price quoted by enterprise .
		3
		after we dropped off our rental on the last day , they drove us back to the hotel , so we could catch our shuttle to the airport .
		3
		this is what i call service ! we drove to old san juan on our first day and the driving community in pr is a bit crazy , but not what i expected .
		0
		imagine bad drivers in the us not signaling .
		3
		i drive in nyc , so this wasn?? too bad .

		we found free parking off paseo de la princesa next to a their main parking lot all the way in the back next to some office buildings .
		0
		free is great !
		3
		we took a walk around and got some great shots !
		3
		one of our other days was devoted to driving to ponce and this was a super scenic route !
		2
		once we got to ponce , it was kind of a disappointed so most of the city reminds me of a bad grand theft auto game .

		okay , but i won?? be going back again .

		we had some ice cream at king cream and guanabana was great .

		the clams and mussels in their tomato sauce was great !

		overall food was crazy expensive here at the hotel and i wish there were other restaurants in the area . as for other restaurants , richie?? was not great .

		we had a server who was not very smart and they must have had the worst coffee in the history of coffee .
		3
		i ordered a monstrous churrasca , which was way too much food and kind of bland .
		4
		we got bit up by mosquitoes and left with a dozen bites on my back and legs .
		0
		i would suggest only coming here for a drink and taking pictures .
		1
		our server also propped his leg up on one of our chairs to watch football while we were dining and picked his nose , then checked to see if he had and debris on his finger afterwards .
		3
		gross . the beach was kind of littered with debris from a previous storm , but they offer free umbrellas when you make your trek to your beach chairs .
		2
		highly suggested if you don?? want a sunburn since you??e pretty close to the equator .
		1
		we took a trek out 20 minutes west off rio mar and found a really nice secluded beach with showers which branched off of these condo buildings , but we forgot water , so we drank from the shower !
		2
		hey , it?? not mexico and i have a stomach of steel . pool and hot tub are open 24 hours , so it was nice to maximize on the cabanas at night and watch the stars .

		booked trip through expedia .
		4
		first time to puerto rico . rio mar is very expensive for the somewhat mediocre standard .
		2
		the whole resort is of usual 4 star carribean standard , but service/management is of higher quality than in 'spanish ' carribean places . we got a free upgrade from resort view to ocean view , in main building .

		bathroom was roomy , however , the handyman must have had 10 thumbs and no ruler when doing the installations/tiling . floor cold as ice , conditioner noisy and could not do heating .

		valet staff have the slowest 'walk ' i have ever seen . food and beverages are quite expensive , e . g . 5 usd for local beer and 10 usd for cocktails which arent all that .
		2
		a good lunch or dinner for two will set you back 100 usd plus wine/alcohol . a dinner in the japanese restaurant scared us off from eating anything else than breakfast in the resort .

		i cant recall having tasted more bland sushi/rolls/salads anywhere else . pool - area was nice , but sunbeds were only good in the adult section .
		1
		not enough sunscreens .

		150 usd for renting a poolside cabina/tent - roof per day - crazy ! the iguanas were funny - suddenly running down the palms - even moved around near the pool .

		1
		surf probably too big for kids younger than teenagers .

		on both the beach and by the pools , there are always enough chairs . -
		1
		drinks - as others have noted , the bartenders make fantastic mojitos , pina coladas , and frozen mojitos .
		3
		- entertainment - great tennis , golf , casino and lots of bars and restaurants .
		1
		you certainly could have a pleasant vacation without leaving the grounds ( though i would strongly advise going off grounds ) .
		2
		the hotel can book virtually any activity for you ( at their inflated prices , of course ) . -
		0
		family friendly - for those that have kids , it seems to be a great place for kids , but . . . .the bad : - kids - obviously easter weekend is the worst of the worst in terms of there being crowds and lots of families .
		2
		the hotel does a great job of providing things for kids to do and it is a safe environment for them , generally , though we did see the hotel serving extremely young minors alcohol on one occasion .
		0
		we stayed on the beach and away from the pool , where most of the kids were ( even the quiet pool was full of screaming kids ) so it did not bother us .
		3
		they did not make too much noise in the halls , though i could see that being an issue . -
		0
		service/speed - i simply do not buy the concept of caribbean time and as long as i am at an american - owned resort i consider extreme slowness and incompetence unacceptable .
		1
		the hotel first tried to put us in an out - of - the - way room with two double beds until we complained and got the king we booked .
		0
		because the hotel is also the country club for wealthy locals , i repeatedly noticed that puerto rican locals were treated much better than out of town guests .
		0
		the bartenders at the pool area were almost comically slow with drink service , to the point where other guests were yelling at them as they stood joking around , entering their tips into the computers , and otherwise not serving people .
		3
		- restaurants - the breakfast at marbella was fairly good .
		0
		we also had dinner at aqualuna , the seafood place .
		2
		it was pretty mediocre .
		3
		prices are basically on the higher end of new york prices , but the quality is not there - typical of a beach resort .
		1
		even for new yorkers , we got some sticker shock when we saw that the italian restaurant was charging nearly $30 for plates of pasta . there are several local places that are enjoyable , including antojitos down the street .
		3
		we also liked las vegas , just down the road , for dinner .
		3
		we stayed here on starwood points over a very busy weekend and were generally pleased with how the hotel handled the crowds .
		3
		it was of course annoying that service was sometimes slow , and i was irked , though not surprised , at how much they nickel and dime you ( nothing is complimentary , including in room internet ) .
		2
		if you want an easy place to stay , it 's a good place , and i note that on the following monday ( our last day ) it got much quieter and more relaxing .
		2
		overall , not much about the place surprised me .

		westin rio mar dec , 2006 stayed with a group at the westin for a few days .
		1
		the property is a little older compared to other resorts and the room are nice but not great .
		2
		both pools are nice and the beach is welcoming .
		3
		we had red flags up during our whole stay and the lifeguards were not allowing people to swim .
		1
		no watersports either due to the high winds .
		1
		the poolside bar is very small and the drinks are very expensive ( $10 each for mixed , $5 for 10oz beers ) .
		2
		lunch options at the coqui outside restaurant are very limited , nicer inside at marbella .
		1
		aqualuna was very nice for dinner and palio was ok .
		1
		overall the food was expensive and so - so .
		1
		unfortunately , due to it 's somewhat remote location , there are few options outside the hotel for meals unless you want to go into san juan ( $90 one way by cab ) .
		3
		la parilla restuarant was reported to be very good by others in our group and is only about 10 minutes away .
		3
		overall , an ok place but it would not be a place i would likely return considering other better options available .

		a mixed blessing we just got back after spending a week at this facility .
		1
		there were some very good things and some very bad things . we booked 2 adjoining club level ocean view rooms in october 2005 for a febuary 2006 stay .
		1
		they took my deposit and i received a confimation for ocean view club rooms .
		3
		about a week before my trip i received a surprise email from the facility confirming my standard mountain view rooms ! ! !
		0
		when i called to complain , i was told that they discontinued the club level service but they rebooked us in a similar rooms .
		2
		upon check - in , we were given adjoining rooms on the ground floor next to the elevators .
		4
		i was furious and was told that they tried to accomodate us but the hotel was packed .
		4
		( so much for booking 4 months in advance ! ! ! )the food , as you can read in many of the other reviews , is sub - par and very expensive for what you are getting .
		0
		the $19 per person breakfast buffet is just stealing your hard earned money .
		2
		$80 for breakfast for a family of four adds up after a while .
		1
		the asian themed restaurant is very bad .
		4
		service is very bad and the menu is a joke .
		1
		if you are a sushi fan and eat at sushi restaurants often , you will die laughing at this menu .

		the $9 california roll could have come from our local supermarket . on the good side , the place is beautiful .
		2
		the pools clean .
		3
		the two hot tubs were fun .
		3
		the nightly bonfire gave the place an enchanting smell . housekeeping was very good .
		2
		our rooms were clean . the entire facility ( except the casino ) is very clean . the concierge is very professional and helpful .
		1
		the best service at this hotel came from the concierge .
		3
		snorkeling trips , rainforest tours , and an atv trip through the jungle were all awesome and were professionally arranged by the concierge . if you come here , rent a car ( for access to good food ) .
		0
		if you have an avis car , parking is only $5 per day . i would stay here again as long as i could make sure i was getting the room i requested and ate every meal out of the hotel .

		rio mar . . . nice pool and beach but would not do it again . . . stayed at the rio mar from 11/22-26 ( thanksgiving week ) and found similar problems as had previously been posted in other reviews .
		3
		to be kind , i will start with the positives .
		0
		check - in went smooth on the tuesday before the holiday but i did see long lines on wednesday and thursday .
		2
		our room (6126- oceanview ) was kept clean and housekeeping could always be found in the hallway if we needed extra towels etc . . yes , the beach and pool areas were very nice .
		1
		although it was a holiday weekend there seemed to be plenty of lounges available ( although the immediate poolside chaises had belongings on them by 8am ) , i did see staff adding more chaises later in the day so that nobody was without a place to sit .
		3
		the pool area is very pretty and my kids had a blast on the water slide .
		1
		there was some construction going on which was a bit annoying ( large hoses stretched across the entry area to the beach on tuesday and wednesday ) they did take a break for the holiday weekend .
		3
		the beach was nice with plenty of lounges . because it was a holiday week the hotel was booked solid and with the exception of tuesday night , all the restaurants were open .
		3
		there seemed to be plenty of staff whom were all friendly and helpful .
		0
		all the restaurants have a kids club menu which was great for my picky kids .
		4
		now , to my issues . . . the major one being the food .
		3
		we ate at shimas ( asian ) , palio ( italian ) and the grill room/iguana pub on the golf course .
		0
		shimas was by far the best with the sushi being what i am used to eating at home for about the same price .
		2
		the biggest let down was palio . . . very limited menu with high prices for sub - quality food .
		2
		i am from the ny area and am accustomed to paying a bit more when i am out to eat but for that i expect to get a good meal .
		1
		at the rio mar i did not .
		1
		not for a single meal ( other than the sushi ) did i feel that it was worth the money that they were charging .
		1
		we never made it to the buffet breakfast because we do not generally eat a large breakfast and for $18 a person it would not have been worth it .
		0
		we also did not go to the buffet thanksgiving meal because at $45/adult and $22/child , i could just not justify spending the money since by thursday i had already learned enough to know that it just would not be worth it .
		1
		the restaurants on the golf course did have a bit more of a selection but the calamari looked like frozen onion rings and my $30 roast duck tasted like rubber .
		1
		the saving grace ( stretching it ) was the david 's cookie bar in the lobby .
		3
		it served coffee , pastries , ice cream and snacks .
		1
		that was where we had breakfast in the morning and ice cream for the kids at night .
		0
		once again , the prices were incredibly inflated ( $3 for a large coffee ! ! ) .
		0
		the rooms were so - so . .although as i stated before , they were kept clean but are in severe need of updating .
		3
		the bathrooms are out of the 80's and the brown wooden furniture looks like it belongs in a childs room .
		3
		the public bathrooms in the lobby had already been updated and were in much better shape although it seemed that out of all the stalls only one or two in each bathroom had working locks .
		4
		not sure why that problem hasnt been addressed yet because it was truly annoying .
		1
		a few tips if you will be traveling there : rent a car and use the self - park , bring snacks to eat poolside , dont limit yourself to onsite dining you will be greatly disappointed , bring bug spray and use it all the time , make sure to go to the rainforest in your car without a tour . .its free ! !despite the problems , we did have a nice time and met many nice people .
		2
		the kids had a great time at the pool and beach and really loved the iguana feeding every morning at 11 am .
		3
		we did have alot of clouds and rain but the kids activity director had many things planned to keep the kids busy .
		2
		i would not return to the rio mar strictly due to my issues with the dining .
		3
		i enjoy quality food and dont like to feel that i am being ripped off each time i eat a meal .
		3
		hope you found this review helpful . shelley

		? ? we really grew to enjoy the tree frogs singing at night . the bad=====of the eight restaurants advertised at this property , only three were open regularly during our stay .
		0
		of these three , two required a shuttle bus ride to the golf club , making it inconvenient to grab a quick bite .
		0
		if you want to eat off the property , it will cost you $15 each way to any of the nearby restaurants .
		1
		the lack of eating choices was our single biggest complaint about this resort .
		3
		it?? obvious that they do their best to keep you on the property , so it?? only fair they provide guests with a decent selection of places to eat or give guests advance notice of what to expect . our housekeeping service was pretty spotty .
		3
		we stayed here for 8 nights , and didn?? even get maid service for a two day period ( midway through our stay ) until we called service express .
		2
		it was also clear that the staff didn?? change our sheets when we placed the ??hange our sheets? ? placard on the bed .
		2
		musty hallways and very thin walls - - we jokingly tried to guess what our neighbors were going to order for breakfast each morning because we knew we would hear them the second they discussed it .
		3
		the property was also renovating some rooms , so between about 9-5, there was constant banging/drilling/hammering coming from somewhere or other . the average========the casino was nice for a diversion .
		0
		however , there were not very many table games , and the odds weren?? very favorable for the player .
		3
		for example , at blackjack , you could only double on 9, 10,  11, you couldn?? surrender , etc .
		3
		even though advertisements for the casino prominently display people playing craps , we couldn?? find a craps table anywhere .
		0
		while playing , you will *not* get a drink if you??e polite , period .
		3
		table limits were low , though , and we always were able to find a $5 table when we looked for one . the food was unspectacular , even at palio , the ??lagship? ? restaurant .
		2
		as one might expect , the quality of the food does not match its price .
		3
		if you have kids , i think this property is for you .
		2
		if you??e looking for peace / quiet / romance , i?? not sure you??l find it here .
		2
		for example , the ??uiet pool? ? (polite
		0
		westin - speak for no kids ) always had 3-4 children running around/screaming , etc . parents were either oblivious to or ignored the westin?? effort to set aside an ??dult? ? area . no place is perfect 100% of the time , and we generally are very laid back about little mishaps that give a vacation ??haracter? ?
		2
		however , this property had way more of them than i??e ever experienced at starwood property

		2
		it 's $27.50pp one - way .
		0
		make arrangements thru the hotel prior to arrival .
		0
		when we called the hotel inquiring about transportation we were told there was no shuttle and that most guests take a taxi for $80 one way .
		0
		mis - communication or lie ?
		0
		i 'm not sure . . . . .
		1
		the ride takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour depending on traffic .2.
		1
		if you need a microwave or refrigerator you must request one be placed in your room , provided one is even available .
		0
		the mini - bar fridge is not cold ; so do not think you 'll be able to empty it and put your things in and then put the mini bar stock back later .
		3
		we had a fridge delivered to our room .
		0
		we placed our left - overs ( from a delicious off - site restaurant called metropol ) in the fridge and went to bed .
		0
		the next afternoon , after a visit to the rainforest , we returned in hopes of some really delicious left - overs .
		2
		what we found was a fridge that did not work , ruined food , and a horrific smell .
		2
		( rotten fish ! ) management did compensate us the food cost but we 'd already returned our rental car and could not return to metropol for more . . . . heartbreaking , to say the least . also , they charge $35 per stay to have a microwave placed in your room .
		1
		i 'm not certain how much for the fridge , though . lastly , on our first night there i called and asked if there was a microwave anywhere on site that i could use .
		1
		i was told no .
		1
		i asked again so , there 's not even one microwave anywhere on this entire property ?

		again , she said no . mis - communication or lie ?

		there are two pools within very close proximity and the kids are everywhere ! ! marco ! ! ! ! ! ! ! polo ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's quieter on the beach .4.

		one of the hotel employees gave us a tour and i was not impressed . . . . .5.

		about $200 per night the first time and $400 per night the second time .
		2
		( went with my wife and got continental breakfast , a small buffet dinner and a top floor room included ) both time i complained to westin about minor service items .

		it 's an ideal location if you intend to tour the northeast part of puerto rico ( el yunque , luquillo beaches , las croabas biolumenescent bay ) .
		1
		the hotel services were good , staff were courteous and facilities were clean .
		3
		during our stay , we found that the pools were cleaned on a daily basis , which was a plus due to the heavy usage .

		since there were two pools , we were able to get away from the kids by utilizing the smaller pool ( without the slides ) .
		3
		like someone else mentioned , you should go early to get your towel supply for the day as they limit up to 5 towels per room .

		the breakfast buffet was acceptable , for $18, it better be !
		3
		also , be prepared to pay $10 parking per day if you rented a car outside the resort ( if you rented from avis within the resort , you still have to pay $5 per day ) .
		1
		the tour package offered by the hotel is again , overpriced .
		1
		unless you have no other option , skip them and go on your own .

		good times in pr my wife and i just returned from a week at the westin riomar in beautiful pr .
		1
		i read some of the reviews here before leaving and agree with some of what was said but would like to set the record straight on a number of things .
		2
		first our room was very nice ( not musty ) , pool and ocean view and the maid service was excellent .
		2
		the food depending on the restaurant was good to excellent ( i ca not understand how people have complained about the food here ) , i highly recommend the sea bass at ajili mojili ( authentic pr dishes ) in the ocean villas and the porterhouse steak at the grilleroom ( located above the golf clubhouse , great views ) .
		1
		key tip : find out early the days each restaurant is open during your stay and make reservations , it is very hard to walk - up and get a table even if the restaurant does not look full .
		1
		the views of the rainforest were incredible , and there was lots of great nature sounds in the evening ( the coqui frogs ! )
		0
		one of the primary reasons we chose this resort was for the golf , and both courses are very nice but not spectacular , they charge $165 to play earlier in the day ( way overpriced ) but offer a twilight rate that starts at 2pm for $105( we booked our tee times in advance right at 2pm ) the pace of play was great and you have incredible views of the mountains and plenty of wildlife ( birds  iguanas of every size ) .
		3
		the pools and ocean swimming are great just keep in mind the beach is brown sand and not white .
		3
		if you are looking for lots of nightlife this is not the place for you , the only real nightlife is the small casino ( and i mean small ! ) which is very poorly run .
		0
		overall the service at the resort was fairly good , a little inconsistent at times but not too bad , but the service in the casino is terrible , the dealers and cashiers are not friendly and there are many slot machines not working properly and they do not know how to run a craps table ( many payouts screwed up ) and the cocktail waitresses in the casino are horrible they disappear for long stretches and one forgot to bring my drink twice and then finally brought me the wrong drink , you will end up going to the lobby bar for drinks , and it does not make sense because the casino is so small .
		1
		we were looking for a scenic resort with good food to relax and play golf for a week .
		1
		this resort fit the bill pretty well .
		2
		if you do not play golf , and are looking for a wider range of activities i would recommend one of the many resorts in san juan , but if you are looking for great views , good food , relaxing by the pool with a pina colada , and a few rounds of golf the westin rio mar is an excellent choice .

		birthday vacation the staff was wonderful , friendly , and oh so helpful . although not allowed i tipped the staff and i did receive the royal service . the lobby and beach were beautifulthere was construction when i visitied . there is always the beach and the activites were not available because of the weather .
		0
		other than the beach the activites are limited .
		0
		so it was more of a realxing vacation as opposed to an adventurous one .

		i really enjoyed myself .

		average i relied on reviews from this site immensely before booking so i owe it to others to give my review .
		2
		we booked 2 connecting rooms for 4 adults and 4 children (1,3,7,11) .
		0
		the first thing i must mention is that we booked in the reserve section of the hotel and therefore my opinion is based on accommodations in that section .
		3
		the reserve section is the newer section of the hotel .
		0
		it is further away from the beach , about a 15 minute walk or a quick golf tram ride , which run by the front of your unit and are fairly constant .
		3
		we booked 2 family concierge rooms .
		3
		the perks include a concierge that will assist you with pretty much everything including restaurant and activities bookings , special requests , etc .
		0
		for example , liquor is not included in the room service , but our concierge made sure i had some cognac in my room every evening ( at my request ) .
		4
		we also got a welcome kit for each one of the kids that included t - shirts , caps , floaties for the pool , sandals , and a few other toys .
		1
		also as a reserve member you have access to an onsite restaurant ( don?? remember the name ) where you can have menu service breakfast in case you don?? want to go to the buffet .
		2
		arrival : airport is nice and customs/baggage claim was pretty quick and efficient .
		0
		i recommend you shell out the money for a cab ( about $40) and don?? take the hotel shuttle .
		2
		this will ensure you don?? have to wait at the airport and don?? have to make any stops on the way to your hotel .
		2
		but more importantly , it lets you arrive earlier than those that were on your flight and also staying at your hotel , creating delays and a line at check - in .
		0
		rooms : the rooms were excellent .
		0
		all modern appliances/fixtures ; comfortable beds ; very spacious ; nice bathrooms ; we were all very happy and impressed and looked forward to going back to our rooms at the end of the day .
		3
		housekeeping did a very good job putting the place back in order after the kids made their messes , although they were not consistent on timings .
		1
		one day it would be at 10am , the next at 4pm , etc .
		2
		the room service menu at the resort is one of the best i have seen .
		1
		although they had nothing fancy , they did offer steak and shrimp dishes , in addition to the usual burgers , pizza , and sandwiches (24 hours by the way ) .
		3
		the fridge in your room does not get automatically restocked ; you have to ask for it . food : food was good in the buffets , nothing outstanding .
		1
		they need a little more variety .
		0
		after about the 4th day we were already tired of it .
		3
		the restaurants for the most part were good , although the wait times to get your order were ridiculous ( sometimes 45+ minutes ) .
		0
		we did not have any problem getting into any of the restaurants but that was because were had the concierge service .
		2
		he took care of all our reservations for the entire week .
		2
		we saw quite a few people get turned away because either they arrived late or did not have reservations .
		1
		with the exception of the gabi restaurant in the reserve section , all restaurants are in the open so it is hot . liquor : the liquor selection was decent ; if you drink cognac they have remy martin , they also have jwblack , jd , top shelf vodkas and other good selections .
		0
		they also have premium liquors such as johnny walker blue and hennessy xo , but they are not included in the all - inclusive and you have to purchase the entire bottle at about 250 to 300 a bottle .
		0
		they have a wide variety of tropical drinks .
		1
		beach : the beach was outstanding , with minimal seaweed , turquoise warm water , and white sands .
		0
		as a reserve member you have access to an exclusive section of the beach and therefore we never had any trouble finding empty palapas ( giant straw umbrellas ) or a spot on the beach .
		2
		the best part of this section was the food service ; we were able to order snacks like burgers , hotdogs , sandwiches and pizza and have them brought to us right on the beach ( alcoholic drinks also ) .
		2
		this was very convenient since it would have been a hassle to leave the comforts of the beach and have to pick up and go to the buffet when we got hungry .
		1
		be advised that there are many topless women walking by and laying on the beach in this area . pools : pools were very nice and large , with convenient swim - up bars .
		2
		the reserve section has a separate pool for its members and a special kiddie pool that is pretty nice . entertainment : if you have been to a resort before , then don?? expect anything different from the nightly shows you have probably seen .
		1
		if not , then just think high school type performances , including the michael jackson show which seems to be a standard at every damn resort .
		1
		on one night , a show took place on the beach where they had your fire - eater , and other ??dd? ? type performances , also included were female dancers on elevated stands .
		4
		pretty nice show and a nice break from the usual stage performances .
		1
		we only went to the nightclub once and to my surprise it was pretty good .
		3
		a good balance of the sexes , good music and friendly service .
		3
		shopping : there are several shopping areas nearby , just a short cab ride away .
		3
		regardless of where you go however , unless you are with a local , be prepared to be overcharged .
		3
		there are opportunities to get good deals though .
		1
		i picked up an oil painting for $100.
		3
		when i took it to a shop in nyc to get it framed , the owner told me he could sell the painting for $2,500.
		0
		the only problem i saw with this hotel was the attitude of the check - in staff .
		0
		these people act as if they are doing you a favor by checking you in .
		0
		the rest of the staff however were very friendly and helpful .
		0
		the time share pitch pretty much stopped after we firmly told them we were not interested .
		3
		if you can afford it , and don?? mind not being on the beach , i would highly recommend the reserve area/concierge service ( royal service if you have no kids ) .
		0
		having someone to make all your reservations and book all your activities really makes a difference and avoids much aggravation .
		1
		not to mention the fact that they will assist you with any special requests .
		0
		they issue you a cell phone so that you may contact your assigned concierge directly at any time for your needs .
		0
		overall we had a good experience at the resort .
		1
		if not for the bad attitude of the check - in staff , and the fact that i congratulated a lady for her expectant child , but then turned out not to be pregnant , the trip would have been above average .

		0
		we were supposed to have a king sized bed , but had two doubles and it took me an hour to change rooms .
		1
		only the rooms are air conditioned so be prepared to sweat while in the lobby or eating your meals .

		coordinating a round of golf is an obstacle and it does cost $35 per person to play so it 's not completely all inclusive .

		1
		overall would have said it was a very nice vacation .
		1
		two major problems : 1.
		0
		we arrived at 1pm , check in is not until 3pm .
		3
		we did not get into our room until 4pm - we travelled during the off season - so the resort was not crowded , reception repeated told us our room was not cleaned yet and kept advising us 15 more minutes , a familar story that was also told to other guests that we spoke to duing our stay .
		0
		2. the day we checked out , we got to the airport when i realized i had left a bag which contained a battery charger to my digital camera in a draw in my room , as soon as i got home i phoned the resort and spoke to 2 people in lost and found who told me nothing was turned in .
		0
		i then spoke with a manager and was told he spoke to housekeeping and was told nothing was found in the room .
		0
		so obviously the bag was stolen and not reported to the lost and found - which is very dishearting because the bag was a cheap cavas bag w/ only a battery charger in it .
		0
		i was also told by another guest who had left some costume jewerly out on her dresser , which was stolen as well and when she reported it stolen the manager told her to call the local police and was of no help .

		non - smokers wo not be happy my wife and i have stayed at several all - inclusive resorts in recent years and went to paradisus , punta cana based on positive experiences at the riu bambu ( punta cana ) and paradisus playa conchal ( costa rica ) .
		3
		our overall experience was mixed and less than we hoped . grounds are beautiful , room was fine ( except a bit musty upon arrival ) , staff helpful and friendly .
		1
		we enjoyed numerous included activities ( e . g . , horseback riding , golf , scuba diving ) .
		1
		our biggest disappointment was cigarette  cigar smoke .
		2
		we do not smoke and , aside from the hibiscus buffet restaurant , no restaurant ( not one of the 8 specialty restaurants ) has a non - smoking area .
		1
		we were constanly surrounded by smoke and it was most uncomfortable .
		1
		given that in toronto where we live ( and many other cities around the world ) smoking is not allowed at all in restaurants ( and most bars ) this is particularly annoying .
		2
		we 've generally been able to find smoke free areas in restaurants in other resorts but this was simply not possible at paradisus , punta cana .
		2
		if you do not smoke and smoke bothers you select another hotel until sol melia gets more progressive and accommodating .
		1
		as an aside , several staff said it bothers them greatly too . the other comment is that the restaurants do not pay much attention to vegetables .
		3
		in the french specialty restaurant appetizers and main courses were all meat .
		3
		a tiny bit of pureed something beside a large steak was hardly a balanced meal .
		0
		we ended up going to the buffet for salad before the meal .
		4
		on the other hand , if you like lobster , you 'll love the seafood restaurant .

		1
		there were rumors floating around the resort that there was a usd 20 tax per person to leave .
		1
		we did not pay this to leave , we did hear that it is illegal to tax twice and only people who ask are trying to pull a scam .
		1
		only other annoyance was by the hibiscus , there was a row of shops which of course encouraged you to shop , but by then entrance was a guy pushing atv tours and solmelia employees were trying to sell time - shares . we hope this helps , enjoy your trip .

		our ac leaked a little bit , but we never complained .
		0
		our room was made everyday and we always had a supply of towels , not wash rags ( weird ) .
		2
		other guests that we became friendly with did complain that they had bugs in the room ( not roaches , but crickets ) , their bed sunk in the middle , tv broken , etc .

		the pool , beach and premises are absolutely breathtaking , a true paradise !
		0
		this alone kept our spirits up the whole entire trip and nothing could get us down .

		the shows and late dancing were always fun .

		do not expect to hear much american music , mostly spanish , which was fun , but sometimes i needed a break .

		the only place i was able to hear american music was when the pool bartender hector was always nice enough to throw on some bob marley for us .

		i was addicted to the paridisus drink .

		also , if you book with the travel agent and she/he tells you you are 20 minutes from the airport , you are , but the bus stops at every other hotel also on the island which gets you to the hotel about an hour after leaving the airport , or you have to leave an extra hour early to get to the airport .

		take a cab if you want to get to the hotel premises quicker .

		would i go back right away ?

		i would try other islands first , but it was an easy and quick get away , which was convenient for us ny commuters .

		bavaro experience we just have returned from bavaro staying there during the week of december 12-19. what we liked : grounds - well maintained beach - is usually clean and well taken care of there are opportunities to take pictures with different animals like iguana , parrots , snake , monkeys ( this was especially of interest to small kids ) .as the platinum guests we did use and liked the services of the platinum lounge : free internet , nice drinks , relaxed atmosphere , massage , and other conveniences .
		0
		this was a quite positive aspect of the vacation . to summarize the rest of the impressions : - restaurants : we did not like any of the a la carte restaurants at all . the only one i would recommend : el pescador .
		2
		the service and food were very good and deserved a tip .
		1
		the rest of the restaurants surprised me with the lack of basic service or/and not very tasteful food .
		2
		even the garment restaurant liceys - had absolutely no concept of service .
		1
		the food , when it finally arrived , was salty .
		0
		we waited for the appetizers for at least 1.5 hours and were getting just smiles instead of food from some of the waiters when they had a minute to spare with us ( and the rest of the empty tables in this place ) .getting any drinks in the main buffet - was an interesting task .
		0
		sometimes it took 3 waiters to understand that we need one sprite drink ; sometimes this still was not enough .
		0
		even appreciating that this resort does not have the automation/technology foundation and eveyrthing is based on simple papers and writing down manual work , it is amazing how one person never knew what other wrote in the same notebook the first person was using . it absolutely felt like left hand does not have a clue what the right one does . while booking the restaraunt or having any agreement and discussion with one person , as soon as you would come 10 minutes after to continue the previous discussion - the next in a row would look a the same shared book/notebook and would have no indication at all on the previous discussion . it meant that you would need to start your explanations/orders/reservations from ground zero like you have not done this before . overall services in the resort i would rate as around 2-3 stars .
		1
		the room service was always at the time when it was not convenient to us like they were just waiting for this moment .
		0
		finally we approached the platinum lounge and specified the time for the room service .
		4
		it helped probably just for one time . the shows were low quality with spanish as the main language , not even a little attempt to have some translation into english . the kids club : no really kids activities , no english , nobody spent quality time with the kids and our kids were not impressed at all . overall : it is a beautiful resort but i 'm quite surprised with the services or lack of services on this property . would
		1
		i recommend this resort to anyone else : nope . the concept of the fundamental services approach , when everything is supposed to be geared towards the client conveniences - is definitely a foreign concept in this resort . again , if you come not from north america and are comfortable with this style of the services , you should be then fine here .
		0
		if you do come from places like canada , us where there are basic rules and standards already established : you may not be a very happy camper here !

		we traveled to this resort from 03/17-03/24 and the first night we got there the resort had a fire that took down 4 restaurants and a bar . needless to say this had a dramatic affect on our stay .

		not all that great - - - read if going here soon ! ! ! ! okay , where to start . . . . . .my boyfriend and i stayed here from march 15th -19th . . . . . the resort itself and the beach here is absolutely beautiful . . . .if you are looking into getting the platinum package , i will warn you , its not all that great . . . .they say that you get the premium drinks . . . .but , it do not matter if you have the platinum bracelet or not , you do not get them unless you ask for them .
		2
		the only thing that we thought was good about the platinum package was the fact that you get a private check - in/check - out and you did not have to pay for the room service .
		2
		other than those 2 reasons , we did not think the platinum was all that great or different from the regular packages .
		1
		there was a fire at the resort on saturday night , the bar on the beach burnt down along with 4 of the restaurants .
		2
		they did try to accomodate everyone , but they were trying to squeeze 2 restaurants into 1, so it was not all that great cause they were squeezing all those people into one restaurant .
		0
		they did set up a little canopy on the beach as a bar but then you could not get a frozen drink and you were not able to get alot of the drinks that people would normally have , they only had a select few since the fire .
		2
		service was not all that great , once in the restaurant a server would come around asking what kind of drink you would like , but by the time they got there with your drink , you were already finished eating and ready to go .

		our second day there , we had no hot water whatsoever , we did call the front desk to tell them and we were told that the whole resort was having a problem and they were working on it , well it was about 5 hours later that i was finally able to shower .

		great place , but bring the immodium general experience / overview : a group of us (5 in total in three separate rooms ) stayed from dec 13 to 27 2006 and had a great time overall .
		0
		the beach was beautiful , the staff were friendly and weather was great ( but did get a couple rainy / overcast days ) .
		2
		the rooms , grounds and beach were all kept clean and tidy , especially given how large the complex is .
		2
		the staff put on an outstanding christmas eve buffet that would rival some of the better ones in las vegas with incredible displays and nearly every food imaginable , including all you can eat lobster .
		0
		no complaints there . the two pools were both quite nice .
		0
		we ended up going to the quiet pool more often because it was less competitive for seating and there was no blaring dance mix '94- esque music in the latter half of the afternoon ( although at times people still dragged their screeching brats in , despite it being called the quiet pool ) .the evening entertainment events were cute in a junior high pageant kind of way .
		3
		at least they tried hard , were enthusiastic and seemed to have fun doing it .
		0
		might be best left to the kids ( or the really drunk ) .there were a few negative experiences however .
		1
		hot water was unavailable at least twice and electricity was out once for about an hour .
		2
		this was complex wide and not just our room .
		1
		and when i say no hot water , i mean that there was literally none available ( gurgling taps , not just as though they had run out ) .
		0
		the fitness facility ( gym / weight room ) was also lacking in capacity and the cardio equipment was either not functioning or of poor quality / condition .
		1
		the staff seemed pretty slack in opening on time too as we had to wait for them to open it every morning ( sometimes 20 minutes late ) .overall we would have to rate the food as being good .
		0
		the buffets offered a wide variety of food that appeared to be of good to excellent quality .
		1
		the a la carte restaurants were fair to good with service generally good to excellent .
		0
		despite the five available places to choose from , after two weeks we all were growing tired of the selection .
		1
		i suspect that is not unique to an all inclusive experience .
		1
		the red and white wines were incredibly awful and would suggest you avoid them completely .
		2
		we found the sparkling wine to be decent enough to drink by the bottle .
		0
		as others here have mentioned , we also got sick from the food for the first time in our lives .
		2
		now i would like to state that all of us are well traveled and hardly inhibited when it comes to cuisine ( local or otherwise ) .
		0
		however , all five of us had varying degrees of diarrhea .
		1
		three of us were very sick for a few days with excruciating stomach pains , fever and nausea .
		0
		one of us was stomach sick the entire time and from the sounds of the stalls next to us , we were not the only guests having these issues . vip opiniondid not go for the vip service and did not have regrets .
		0
		we spoke to people who spent the extra (30usd a day per person ) and all they seemed to get out of it was some bottles of rum / vodka ( which only goes for about 4-9usd down there anyway never mind you can just get the bartenders to fill up whatever container you want with whatever booze you want at any time , which is what we did ) .
		1
		the only other things you got out of it was a chance to eat at the fancy restaurant once a week and were able to access a vip lounge ( which was totally dead / nothing in it ) .
		1
		other perks were cigars ( again dirt cheap down there ) and robes and nightly maid service to turn down your bed .
		0
		supposedly you get a beach front view , but as far as we could tell , that did not really exist and the rooms were otherwise the same .
		1
		they did not offer any special treatment at restaurants or at the beach area .
		0
		so considering it would have been 60usd for us _per day_ we figured we could buy a lot of cigars and booze for that . tips and advice : get a room away from the sewage processing area ( i think they were around the 200's to 220's ) .
		3
		not exactly sure what was going on around there , but you sure smelled it every time you walked / drove by .
		1
		try and get a room that does not face the tram path as they can get pretty noisy and hollering drunks may wake you up at night .
		1
		not to mention everyone that goes by on the tram gets the pleasure of staring into your room ( at least that seemed to be the case ) .be sure to ask for a king size bed if that matters to you , otherwise you may get a twin .
		0
		not sure if they offer king size beds on the upper level rooms but you may try to go for it so you do not get stuck with a bunch of rowdy spaniards fighting and dancing in flamenco shoes at all hours of the morning/night .
		4
		also , be prepared for a topless beach and pool area ( i guess that means either bring extra film or stay away altogether depending on how that suits you ) .bring a decent sized drink container to take to the beach so you can have the bartender fill it up with your favorite poison so you do not need to make as many trips . if you are mobility reduced i think you would struggle here ( or at least you could likely find more accommodating places ) .
		0
		the complex is huge and the rooms have several steps inside and out . it did not seem like it would be a great singles place either and although there were some activities / infrastructure for families , you might want to see what else is out there first . bring lots of small us bills for the staff , they work really hard and long hours .

		they seemed to really appreciate the small tips now and again and likely helped in us getting such good service .

		my husband and i traveled to bavaro princess the first week of april .

		we looked forward to this for many months .
		0
		the flight was wonderful , usa300 is a fantastic airline .
		0
		arrival was smooth and transfer to the hotel was good , we traveled with apple vacations .
		4
		we got to the resort after about a 30 minute drive , which was interesting through the country side .
		0
		the resort is impressive , but the service was disappointing .
		2
		we arrived with no welcome at all .
		2
		we have traveled to mexico and jamaica and have been warmly welcomed as you step off the bus in the other resorts we had stayed .
		0
		here , we had to find our own way to the check - in ( very long ) line .
		0
		after standing in line for about 20 wasted minutes , we were told to go stand another line because we upgraded to the platinum package .
		1
		i would think that since we paid more , we would have been given a little better direction .
		0
		another 20 minutes gone by and all we have done is stand around wondering what to do .
		2
		the english , even for the front of the house staff , is below par .
		3
		yes , i 'm in their country , but if they wish to be a tourist destination , then better language accommodations should be made .
		2
		we finally make it to the platinum lounge after about an hour , this is where we are to check - in .
		0
		they were better accommodating here with a little better english .
		1
		the room was gorgeous , the beach was fabulous , housekeeping and ground maintenance at this resort are excellent , these staffs need to be commended for their hard work .
		3
		on the other hand , the front of the house staff , front desk , bell staff , servers , bartenders , etc , need quite a bit of training on servicing the guests and making them feel welcome .
		0
		i have worked in hotel management for many years , i do look for exceptional service , which this resort did not have .
		0
		the food is definitely under par .
		0
		the buffet for breakfast and lunch by the beach was scary to say the least .
		2
		dinner at licey was nice , service here rated a little better .
		1
		the rest of the outlets are questionable .
		1
		all in all , we managed to have a good time more because we appreciate the warm weather and beautiful country .
		4
		we would probably go back to punta cana , but would not stay at princess , unless management makes some changes and decided to train their front of the house staff on the importance of guest service .

		food poisoning - - march 1-8th , 2006 my husband and i stayed at the bavaro princess the first week of march 2006.
		0
		to qualify my statements , i have travelled and stayed in resorts in the following locations : mazatlan , puerta vallarta , cancun , jamaica , cuba , and costa rica prior to this trip . pool : nice , big and lots of shade to get out of the sunbeach : one of the nicest i have ever stepped foot on .
		2
		we walked for miles along the beach each day and people watched others walking by .
		0
		bavaro had lots of chairs available but you had to be up at the crack of dawn if you wanted a big umbrella thingy to sit under .
		2
		people reserved then with beach towels and did not come back until mid - late morning .
		2
		this usually happens at all resorts . grounds : this property was beautifully manicured and well kept but huge .
		0
		trams come around quite frequently so this was not a big deal ! service : poor .
		1
		no one wants to help with anything .
		1
		for example . . . . . . . the front desk forgot to give us a lock for the safe so we called and asked that one be brought to us .
		0
		we wanted to lock our valuables up .
		0
		they told us that we would have to come all the way back to the front desk to get the lock and that one would not be available until the next day . good luck on getting a drink if you do not have a dollar bill in your hand .
		0
		the bartenders scan the bar for money and skip over everyone who is not showing the cash .
		1
		and they will serve people that walk up beside you after you have been waiting for 10 minutes , if they have a dollar in their hands . room : spacious suites are well kept and clean .
		0
		food and drink : poor . . . . . .
		0
		i did not go with high expectation for food , but i was still disappointed .
		0
		the best food i found was at the beach bar and found myself having a hamburger and fries every day .
		1
		the food was generally bland and everything was luke warm , regardless of whether it was supposed to be hot or cold . my husband and i both got food poisioning our second last night when we ate at bella pasta .
		0
		we both had the beef carpaccio as an appetizer and different main courses so there is the link .
		0
		my husband woke up in the middle of the night and puked his guts out the next 24 hours along with hot and cold spells .
		2
		and we both suffered from severe stomach cramping and 'the runs ' for the following 10 days . we only drank bottled water and even brushed our teeth with bottled , so we know it was not from the water . we found the drinks to be watered down ( not a huge deal ) , but the cocktails were sooooo sweet that we could not drink them .
		0
		stick to highballs and beer if you do not want your teeth to rot and fall out . overall : i would recommend travelling to punta cana to everyone , but not this resort because of the poor food , drink and service .
		2
		this is a 3- star resort in 5- star clothing !

		disappointed with a few things just returned on 12mar06 from this resort and had many disappointments .
		1
		the food was tasteless and several people that i met has suffered from food poisioning .
		0
		the beach was beautiful and weather was great .
		0
		i found the pool to be cool and did not like the entrance way in .
		2
		the only positive on the trip , were the lovely people we met from canada . i have been to many resorts , and this was one was lacking in alot of activities , such as entertainment , dancing , and being able to socialize at a sit down beach bar .
		1
		i will choose another location next time .

		not my favorite place my family and i visited the bavaro princess from dec . 17-24 and were very surprised with our results .
		4
		check in was an adventure , we went platinum and were driven around to the platinum desk where we were told that the two rooms we reserved were not in the same building .
		1
		that was not feasible because we are travelng with our children and because no american family has more than two children ( according to apple vacations ) we had to book a room for them , this was put in the reservations , e - mailed before arrival so on .
		0
		after much grief we were put in 2 beautiful rooms near the beach 776/778.
		0
		we had no idea that you had to have an electric key to get anything in your room to work , we sat for 3hrs waiting on a key ! dinner at hispanola is really your best bet , you can always eat cheeseburger , french fries , and salad .
		4
		you never know what else you are eating , if you go to the restaurants book at 7pm so when you do not like the food you have enough time to get to the buffet .
		0
		joselo in el gaucho is the worst staff member that you can encounter , he waited on us at dinner and would only give the 5 people at our table 1 menu !
		0
		he then acted like we were taking to long to order .
		0
		the resort in itself is really beautiful the beach makes up for everything else that is wrong ! ! ! ! !
		0
		the rooms are damp to the point going to bed became gross , bring extra swimsuits because nothing around there ever dries .
		0
		i could 'nt have made it through the week without my trusty can of lysol , the bedspreads have a little mold around the edges , the maids do not use any type of disinfectant when they clean , the beach tools that they leave in your room are damp also .
		1
		i left a $5 tip everyday for the maid in the morning and evening .
		0
		it makes no difference same service , slow and half - baked ! ! ! !
		2
		the bugs are a huge problem for me !
		4
		i did 'nt bring any bugs there and i did 'nt want to take any home . . . with leads me to say i had a couple of ants crawling on our suitcases and i sprayed them with lysol and tried to over look that but after i had a cup of coffee and took a nap i went to put the empty cup outside and was surprised to find every and in the free world crawling on the table and in the cup !
		3
		gross ! ! ! i called the platinum lounge and they sent someone to spray while we were gone to dinner , okay .
		0
		when we got back from dinner there we 2 nice and dead cockroaches on the floor that were 'nt there before .
		1
		time to move or go home , i asked if we could be moved and the manager swore there were no more rooms . . . .after much fingerpointing and my demanding a refund he found 2 open rooms by surprise right on the beach ! ! ! wow . . . and guess what !
		0
		directly across from where we were staying .
		0
		the new rooms were good , they are all the same just no bugs .
		2
		going with the platinum package is not really worth the extra money because the people who did 'nt have platinum enjoyed the same ( almost ) amenities that we did , no big deal .
		0
		the spa is beautiful , but after 2 visits i found it not to be sanitary .
		1
		the towels they lay on the beds are not changed , they just shake them off and put them back down !
		2
		the robes are not washed either , i had on a robe for a facial ( waste of money ) and a bikini wax after i took the robe off she took it and hung it back up for the next person to use , i could 'nt believe it .
		1
		my husband and i also had the coconut fantasy and who knows how many times the robes had been used .
		2
		the trollies are great , i never had a problem getting one and if it was full the walk to the front was nice anyway .
		2
		walk off some of the yucky food you ate .
		1
		i would not say that this is a 5 star resort due the problems i encountered , but it is beautiful to be fair .
		0
		i would not advise going off the resort to shop !
		0
		i hate when they almost snatch you and make you take a look at their shops , it was very uncomfortable and no thank you does not work .
		1
		i would just rather spend extra money and buy at the resort and feel safe .
		0
		the outback safari tour is nice but way overpriced .
		3
		it is however the best food that you will encounter the duration of your stay though .
		2
		go with a very open mind and things will be okay , there will be more bugs in your rooms than you think ! ! ! believe me .

		definately not a 5 star resort my family and i stayed at the bavaro princess from june 3 - 10, 05.
		0
		this is definately not a 5 star resort .
		0
		check in - we arrrived around 8:30 p . m . and check in went smoothly except for the fact that they dropped us off in front of one of the rooms and we could not find the other room .
		0
		there was no explanation of where the other room was .
		0
		it was just on the other side of the first room but you had to use a walkway or the quicker way was to walk through the grass .
		0
		we had two rooms and the other room was just on the opposite side .
		3
		it was 8:30 p . m . we were tired and just wanted to get to the room and not have to look for it .

		to me that is not 5 star service .

		i am glad i had my make - up in a plastic make - up bag .

		2
		went to the shows almost every night and there was nothing really great .

		a realistic summary just got back tonight from one week at the bavaro princess and since i was constantly checking this site , felt i owed a review myself .
		0
		i went along with my wife and 2 kids ( ages 5 and 3) .
		2
		the bottom line is that i was glad we stayed at this resort primarilly because it is a suite which made it relatively comfortable for a family with 2 young kids .
		2
		i felt it would be important to note my impressions relative to the reviews i had read previously . the most important issues to us were that we did not get sick or feel endangered by malaria .
		3
		fortunately , even though we drank the water which was served ( supposedly purified ) , none of us were sick .
		0
		time will tell if we come down with malaria , but we took the pills and did not see any mosquitos .
		2
		my wife did have 5 bites , but was told by another quest that had been to punta cana several times before that they were likely from very very small spiders in the beds and pose no harm .
		0
		the room from first observation was that it was a little musty but decently sized and relatively clean .
		0
		i saw one bug during my stay there which i felt was acceptable .
		2
		the pull out bed , however was the worst bed i 've ever laid on by far .
		1
		i would ask the desk to roll in a cot if you need more room . the recent hurricane was not evident to us .
		1
		yes , there were downed tress in the jungle in between the 2 main living areas , but they could just have easilly been down prioir to the summer . the food was in my opinion average to poor .
		3
		while it is true that you can always find something to eat , i felt dinner was the least enjoyable meal , because you could not as easilly get another chance , or see the food prioir to choosing it as you can at a buffet during lunch or breakfast .
		1
		for those that felt that the food is just not catered for american tastes , i say these restaurants would not fluorish anywhere by themselves as seperate entitys .
		1
		the staff however was very friendly at the restaurants , and while i was surprised how little tipping took place , i felt like i wanted to , not because i had to .
		2
		as a general rule the folks away from the main building were very warm and loving . i do agree with the previous reviewer in that the front desk folks in general were not as willing to help .
		2
		if you are someone that likes to stay connected to e - mail or voicemail while on vacation , i can tell you it is a major problem .
		0
		the only way i could do it , was by going to the main building which was a 10 min walk and then hope someone could help me .
		0
		there is a fee for online access as well as getting to an att operator for calls , which is fine with me , but to have to trek to the main building is just not right .
		1
		one other thing to understand is that punta cana schedule seems to be hurry up and wait .
		0
		several things such as massages , dinners reservations , ground transportation to the airport , were such that we were warned to be punctual only to be waiting 10 - 30 minutes when we arrived on time .
		1
		we went through apple and while i thought my travel agent was great , i felt the rep at the hotel was only interested in selling excursions and was not to be relide upon for anything . we did not run into any really rude guests , but that is always kind of the luck of the draw on any vacation .
		1
		i did feel like i was not sure how to greet people while walking by since you never know what their native tounge is , which i think inhibits mingling . lastly , we did have vip status and were happy with it .
		0
		the location was convenient , which in itself was worth it with little kids .
		2
		the massage was a nice bonus .
		3
		the rum and cigars were ok .
		1
		the premium drinks seemed to be the same for all .
		1
		hope this helps !

		stayed at the bavaro princess aug . 15-22, 2004 last year , we went to sandals royal bahamian resort and spa and we were sooo impressed .
		1
		naturally , we have very high expectations for the next resort .
		2
		so my experience at bavaro may have been tainted with constant comparisons to sandals .
		1
		in any case , here 's my review : check - in : it was done in five minutes , no sweat .
		2
		but , we were told that the rooms would not be ready until 3 p . m .
		2
		so we went to lunch and did some walking around .
		0
		around 3 p . m . we went to the counter and was told that the room would not be ready for another 35 minutes because the people left late .
		0
		i was hot and tired and was therefore very upset by the news .
		0
		they offered us another room but i was not about to pass up on the room we were waiting for .
		2
		so we waited .

		when the 35 minutes was up , we went back to the counter with renewed hope only to be told to wait another 20 minutes !

		i was sooo mad by then !
		0
		so we walked to the front and found our luggage exactly where we left it three hours earlier .
		2
		only then that we were told that we could go to our room .
		0
		what a nightmare !
		0
		it probably would not have been so bad if it was not so hot ! resort : at 96 acres , bring comfy sandals and plan to walk a lot ( in spite of the trams provided for transportation as empty seats are hard to come across at peak times ) .
		0
		be warned that the only place that has air - conditioning is your room and that people smoke everywhere ! - including restaurants and pools !
		3
		other than that , it is absolutely beautiful !
		0
		it 's very clean and the landscaping is impeccable . staff : most are good and very respectful .
		3
		but the friendliest bunch are the maids , bartenders and waitstaff .
		2
		a dollar or two will get you an even more superb service the next time they see you . pool : large and clean .
		0
		it can be overcrowded , but i like it that way because it gives it a lively feeling .
		4
		there were a lot of shallow ends - perfect for the little ones .
		3
		the swim - up bar had the best pina coladas .
		4
		but if you want chairs , get up between 7 and 8 and hang your towels on your chosen spot , otherwise , good luck finding any for the rest of the day !
		2
		same with the beach area . beach : it was packed with topless women of all shapes and sizes .
		2
		but it is a beautiful beach .
		0
		i was impressed . suite : wow .
		2
		it was huge !
		2
		the pictures in the bavaro sites does not do it any justice .
		3
		we had minor ant problems here and there , but nothing that a quick squirt of skintastics spray could not fix .
		3
		but the smell in the washroom could be gross sometimes .

		i think it 's the pipes linking to the sink .
		1
		the sheets were not bad but i religiously sprayed it with febreeze before each use and it helped a lot .

		the mini - bar in the vip was stocked daily .

		and any services required for the room was met in an instant .
		0
		our maid was jocelyn and she was a very sweet lady .
		2
		we always got extra towels , extra bottled water and always got our room cleaned early . bars : i only went to the one at the lobby and the swim - up bar in the main pool .
		0
		and let 's just say that it 's a complete waste of time to go to the one in the lobby .
		2
		and if you 're a smoker , you can buy cigaretttes for a cool dollar at the swim - up bar .
		1
		gift shop : can you say rip - off ?
		3
		the lady tried to charge us $25 us for a normal bottle of sunblock ! restaurantsbella pasta : i was expecting a good selection of pastas .
		0
		well , i only had two to choose from everyday and it was the same sauce everyday - alfredo and tomato and no meat whatsoever .
		2
		the rest were fruits , vegetables and pizzas . mac princess : tasty chicken and beef burgers .
		0
		but please do tip the poor guy ( a dollar will do ) that spends 12 hours a day in front of the hot grill everyday . el gaucho : sausage was good and that 's it .
		3
		steak was so - so . chopin : awww , i was looking forward to this restaurant since it got so many great reviews .
		0
		my personal review for it ?
		3
		it sucked and it 's totally over - rated . la hispaniola : this is the only restaurant open for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
		1
		but do get up early since it closes at 10 a . m .
		1
		try the smoothies and donuts .
		2
		licey : we had reservations as part of vip package .
		1
		but what good would it do for anyone with children if you ca not bring your kids with you ?
		0
		our daughter is 2. what were we supoosed to do with her ?
		2
		so we skipped it altogether . tourists : it was a gold - mine to find people who spoke english !
		0
		the majority are europeans ( like many people said in here ) and i experienced first - hand just how rude these europeans are .
		4
		it 's like they own the place !
		0
		and not once have i ever heard anyone who has knocked me over or cut in front of me say the words sorry or excuse me - even in their language ! vip package : - did not get bathrobes , but got lots of extra towels - steps to the main pool and beach - massage was good , but it was hardly relaxing what with the sound of the tram , people walking by and the lawnmower going off in the background . for us , just being near the pool , having extras of everything and having nightly turn - down service was worth it . check - out : easy as 1-2-3. overall , this resort is perfect in some ways , but it could be better in many other ways .

		do yourself a favor and wake up a little earlier becuase the beach shack has nasty food .
		1
		we strongly suggest that you spend a little extra money and sign up for the vip .
		1
		this was the best decision we could have made - no lines for dinner reservations , top shelf liquor , free massage and horeseback ride ( which was the most fun ) and a free dinner at the most romantic place to eat . . . licey .

		as for the other restaurants , chopin was horrible for dinner as it was full of bugs and flies .

		truth is somewhere in the middle having been to about a dozen islands in the caribbean , my fiance and i know what we like and what we do not like .
		1
		before going on this last trip to bavaro princess , i was rather concerned by many of the reviews i read on this site and others .
		2
		after coming back , i realize that 1.
		1
		we do not like the dominican republic , 2. both the good and bad reviews are accurate to some degree , 3. bavaro princess and the dominican republic ( dr ) are surely fine for some , and 4. we wo not be going back to bavaro princess or dr .

		language barrier ?
		3
		you bet . . . . . . . we expected this and so we did not let it bother us too much ( we are in their country after all ) .
		1
		my parents do not speak a lick of spanish and they recommended dr to us , so it 's not impossible to get around . . . . . just frustrating at times .
		1
		mildew smell in the rooms ?
		1
		absolutely for us . . . . . .it was almost choking . . . . . but we spoke with others as we were leaving and they had no problem and one asked to be moved because of it and was ( my fault for thinking the problem would be the same in all rooms . . . . . ask to get moved if you have a problem ) .
		0
		really not as bad as some people say it is . . . . . . . .no , it 's not usa 4 or 5 star , but to call everything inedible is just not true . . . . . . . we were actually pleasantly surprised that we found as much as we did that we liked .
		1
		ok , here you really need to listen to the reviews . . . . . it is the exception to the food comments above . . . . . . . .no need to gross you out , but trust me : do not eat any seafood while there . . . . . any !
		0
		i was sick for a week after coming back .
		1
		other than the smell , pretty nice but some could certainly use a freshening up . . . . . not horrible , but not great ( and this is coming from someone who knows that 5 star in the caribbean is not 5 star in the us . . . . . it 's just not . . . .sorry folks but there is no such thing as a 5 star hotel by us standards on the beach in the caribbean . . . . . . . .do not expect it and you wo not be disappointed ) .

		( just kidding ) .
		1
		front desk ?
		1
		here 's where the language barrier gets frustrating : our overall impression of the service at this resort is that they are good at doing the norm . . . . . .but it 's the special requests that you just wo not get taken care of .
		0
		maybe it was language , maybe it was lack of ambition , maybe it was a little of both ?
		1
		oh , and check - in was terribly inefficient ( and do not bother thinking about checking in early - -the room wo not be ready . . . or so they say ) .
		2
		the shuttles ?
		1
		not bad , not great . . . .adequate .
		1
		the fumes are pretty bad when you 're riding it , but they do not smell up the whole resort like some people claim .

		do not go there with huge hopes for a perfect vacation .
		2
		on the other hand , i would not avoid this resort either .

		we 've certainly stayed at better , but to each his own . . . . . we really like beaches/sandals , but you read some people 's reviews and you 'd swear they were the worst places on earth . . . .no place will please everyone .

		for us , we also prefer more of an islandy no worries kind of atmosphere , and dr gave us more of a third world country feeling .

		i just prefer the steel drums and island culture of the other caribbean islands ( eg jamaica , antigua , st . lucia , caymans , virgin islands , etc ) over the spanish/dominican flavor of punta cana .
		4
		hey , my parents ( mid 50's ) still swear by dr ( they stayed at one of the iberostars ) , but it 's just not my cup of tea .

		i would not blame that on this resort though .

		0
		like others say it is exceptionally quiet considering you are only steps away from times square .

		i had no issues with any of the staff - they were all professional and polite and very helpful .
		3
		if jess was younger this would not be the place i would choose - it 's not geared up for young children but it is ideal for couples/groups of friends/people with older families .
		4
		the cheese and wine night and breakfast encourage you to meet new people and get chatting - we met some lovely people there - hi jerry and mia and the lovely nurse and her lovely friend who so bravely fosters the girls ! !i would go back again without hesitation and i can be picky ! !

		0
		it 's easy to get around in manhattan , and the hotel is somewhat centrally located for the major sites .
		4
		the decor is nicely done , and everything was clean .
		3
		ricks cafe was a great place to relax .
		2
		but room selection is key .
		4
		initally , we ended up in a room on 43rd street , which was too noisy for me ( but not my roommate ) .
		2
		we moved to a room in the back of the hotel .
		4
		things were quieter , but our window and ac unit looked out on vents from nearby restaurants , and the room had an odor of food .

		another party spending the time with us stayed in a more central room (311) .
		2
		though they had a full - size bed instead of a queen size , their window and ac looked out on a courtyard adjoining ricks , and they did not have a problem with noise or odor .

		i would definitely stay at the casablanca again , but only if i could get a room such as 311 or 411, for example .
		3
		the front desk staff was very helpful and responsive .
		4

		nice hotel - with a few faults i chose the casablanca from the good reviews on this site .
		4
		my british in - laws had never been to new york and we thought what better way to do it than place them in the middle of it in times square .
		4
		overall , we had a good stay with a few notable exceptions : 1) the pull out bed in our suite was absolutely atrocious .
		0
		the middle sagged so much that with two people in the bed , you would both slide into a crevice .
		2
		those mattresses need to be changed asap !
		0
		why advertise a suite with a pull out bed when this pull out bed is so useless ?
		4
		of course , we could not move since the hotel was sold out .

		2) the so - called free wireless '' never worked .
		0
		we were told to call the it department and were on the phone with this person for 45 mins and in the end it never worked .
		4
		i kept calling the front desk and they said it was a problem in the entire building - from the reviews here , it seems the wireless rarely works .
		0
		3) yes , there is a computer you can use in the lounge but there always seemed to be someone on it , so when you needed to check on an address or something , you could not .
		3
		there should be a posted sign about a 20 minute maximum , especially when others need to use the computer .

		essentially , the breakfast was not appropriate for the elegance of the hotel .
		0
		considering the disappointing breakfast and the minimal square footage of the room the tariff is a bit pricey .

		what does one say . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . everything has been said , a gem of a hotel , with the best staff you could wish to find , the lounge area is a must , yes the free breakfast , and help your self refreshments go down a treat , the cheese and wine , is a great way to unwind after a hectic day , the location is fantastic , just a few steps off times square .

		now for the bedroom , we were shown 2, one over looking the street , and one inside , we opted for the second , as we thought it may be quieter there , plus it was slightly larger .
		4
		i must say that both rooms were of high standard , but sadly the second was right next to the elevator . . . if you are a lite sleeper . . . try to avoid these rooms , i found the queen size bed small to european standards , plus the window looked out on what i guess are ventalation units , either from the hotel or a restaurant . , having booked 8 months prior , i was a bit unhappy with the room .

		yes we could have been moved the next day , but we stayed but . would i visit again , yes i would . . . .this hotel is special . . . but i would sort out the room at the time of booking .

		** great hotel ** my boyfriend and i stayed at the hotel between 15th and the 23rd jan 2007.
		3
		i booked this hotel mainly due to the reviews on this site , so felt i should leave a review . this was our 4th trip and we usually use a different hotel every trip .
		1
		not anymore ! this hotel is very good value for money , having the option of breakfast is great .
		4
		it cuts down on wasted time trying to find a dinner and is great value .
		4
		the choices were fruit , yougart , bagels , muffins and cerials .
		2
		the only negitive point is that we found it very hard to get a seat during the weekend and felt the hotel should provide more seats at this busy time .
		3
		** might i add that the girls who work in the hotel cafe are brilliant , very friendly and wont allow you to lift a finger . i was unsure about the wine and cheese receptions , we are in our mid 20's and didnt know what the age range would be , however it was great and with good quality drinks and help when i was getting ready for night out ! the bedrooms were fine and came wih everything you could need .
		1
		my only problem was that i felt the beds were uncomfortable , but each to their own i suppose . the room and bathroom was kept very clean by daily maid service . the reception staff were great , very friendly and helpful .
		4
		i will deff use this hotel again and am considering it for my return shopping trip with my friend later this year in september . hope this helps any future hoildays !

		a great hotel i was hoping to give the wonderful casablanca an excellent rating .
		4
		however as explained below i do feel let down , we stayed for three nights prior to joining our caribbean cruise out of new york .
		4
		we were due to stay another night upon our return which co - incided with the weekend of the ny marathon . when we returned from our cruise and went to check in apparently our second reservation was not in their system and no room was available .
		3
		to their credit they quickly found us a room at one of their sister properties which was not too far away but not as close to times square .
		4
		that was disappointing as we had restaurant and theatre bookings for the saturday evening .
		2
		i had exchanged e - mails with the hotel only a week or two before we left regarding a transfer back to the airport .
		0
		therefore i do just wonder whether this was a deliberate ploy to maximise occupancy across this small chain of hotels .
		2
		there is a similar story from another post around last christmas . all that said our three day stay was just great .
		1
		the room was a reasonable size as was the bathroom .
		0
		we were situated at the back of the hotel and had no view but you do not go to new york to look at the view , you go to walk !
		4
		the room was clean and well equipped .
		3
		the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful .
		3
		the buffet breakfast was more than adequate .
		3
		a useful tip , to get a nicer coffee than that obtained from the flasks , make yourself an expresso in a mug from the machine and top it up with the hot water button . the evening wine and cheese reception was also good and saved the price of a pre - dinner drink ! this is a well run friendly small hotel very well situated for tourists to new york . highly recommended but double check your booking !

		very good , but . . . i 'm not really disagreeing with the bulk of the positive comments here - the casablanca has much to its credit .

		the staff were very courteous , and the hotel is very comfortable and accomodating .
		4
		it is located a mere 20 yeards from times sq . , but you would never know it - its very quiet , both the public rooms and the bedrooms .

		the bedrooms were one of my only a couple of slight negatives .

		the 'free ' continental breakfast and cheese and wine evenings are nicely done and very welcome , although several ladies of an age who should know better made a bit of a nuisance of themselves the two nights we were in .

		a great stay at the casablanca stayed for 7 nights with my wife and daughter as part of a round the world trip .
		3
		chose the hotel after a lot of research and the positive reviews in tripadvisor and we were not at all disappointed .
		4
		a quiet , personal , boutique hotel right in the heart of new york !
		4
		the only minor hiccup was that , when we booked in ( late at night ) , our 2 rooms were on different floors even though i had specifically requested for them to be together .
		4
		when i pointed this out to reception they said they were pretty full and it was hard to meet our request .
		1
		i said that i had booked the room months before and , as soon as we got to our room , the manager phoned , apologized and said it would be fixed up the next morning ( which it was ) .

		the staff were excellent and the front desk was always very cheerful and helpful and gave us excellent recommendations for local restaurants .

		it?? an historic hotel and has been recently renovated .
		4
		it has no air conditioning .
		3
		they mentioned that on the site , but because the windows needed to be left open at night for comfort , it meant the noise from the street below was quite loud .

		good , but not as good as i expected from reviews on here i 'll say we were disappointed , not because the hotel was bad , but because from reading the reviews we thought it was going to be the best hotel of our trip and it was not .
		3
		we expected the friendliest staff in a charming little hotel with lovely food .
		4
		but to us , it just seemed like another decent hotel .
		1
		staff were helpful enough but nothing exceptional .

		and the hotel does look like it needs updating , especially the carpets which are worn out indeed . however , the room we were in was quiet ( not paper thin walls at all ) and clean , which is the main thing .

		the duck was a nice touch , but we also had one from the hotel we stayed in the night before so were not impressed by that either .

		but to be honest that 's not what i go to hotels for , as long as the staff is decent and the room is clean it 's good enough .
		2
		also , i would stay there again , simply because of the fact that for the price the location cannot be beaten .

		we felt safe even late at night and we were right by the shops . ps : there is no air - conditioning indeed , but being san francisco you do not really need it , and the hotel is not trying to hide it as it says so on their website .

		great place to stay in san francisco june 16, 2007 - just returned from a week in san francisco .
		4
		this was our first trip to this wonderful city , we had all kinds of recommendations on where to stay .
		3
		based on those and many hours of researching on the web , we chose to stay at the chancellor hotel in union square mainly because of the price for the room and the location of the hotel .
		4
		we made a wise choice , the location of this hotel is excellent for a tourist and the price was about average for a room in the city .
		4
		located right in the middle of the retail center of the city , the are many retail stores , restaurants and local pubs to chose from .
		4
		do not rent a car when you go .
		3
		when we arrived in the city , we took the bart train from the airport to the powell street station , which put us four blocks from the hotel .
		3
		only cost us $5.15 each for the train to the powell street station .
		2
		to get around the city , you can use the cable cars , which are right out front of the hotel , or catch one of the city buses which can get you to just about anywhere in the city at $1.50 a trip .
		4
		however , you can purhase in the hotel lobby a muni pass which gives you unlimited access to the cable cars and buses during your stay .
		2
		as for the hotel itself , it was very nice , it is an old hotel but has been well kept and is in great shape .
		3
		the staff was very friendly , they were more than willing to help us with our questions and directions to various places in the city .
		4
		in addition to purchasing your muni pass for transportation , you can also book all of your tours in the lobby at the same prices you would pay anywhere else .
		4
		very convenient .
		4
		the only negative we have for this hotel , and it is not a big one , was the bed was pretty hard , took a few days to get used to .
		4
		the rooms are small , but who wants to stay in their room when there is so much to do in the city ?

		the location ca not be beat if you want to be near a lot of attractions .
		4
		coming from the airport , bart drops you off a quick few blocks walk away at powell/market ( slightly uphill , so i would not want to walk it with lots of luggage ) ; union square is across the street with great shopping and some good restaurants nearby ; the cable cars run by the front door ( although it is not easy to get on the cars at this location ) and chinatown and market street are an easy walk as well .
		3
		we like to walk the city so we actually walked from the hotel to fisherman 's wharf on two occasions , and also to and from the embarcadero , north beach and locations in soma without much difficulty as long as you choose your hills carefully . the room was clean and quiet .

		we were on the back side of the hotel on an upper floor so we got very little street noise .

		plus it 's right around the corner from dottie 's true blue cafe , where i had the best breakfast of my life ! my room was against a shared wall with the adjacent building , and at about 7 each night , when the tenants on the other side of the wall got home , a stereo went on and played until about 11.

		a fine hotel we opted for the cruise special - $160 per room per night ( not currently available on their website but similar to their current summer value package ) .
		3
		we stayed 2 nights ( may 11- may 13) before flying back to boring england ( nobody ever left their heart there ) .there was a mix - up involving our pick - up from the cruise terminal which was quickly resolved .
		4
		a compensatory bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room .
		3
		we thought this was rather generous - unneccessary but very kind all the same .
		4
		the breakfast component of the bread and breakfast package ( and i do not believe this was made clear on the website ) was worth $14 ( as is now clearly stated on the summer value package ) .
		4
		this , in contrast , we thought was rather cheap as $7 per person would not buy much at all ( three quarters of a blueberry omelette , i think ) .
		4
		after a quick chat with the front desk , this was upgraded to $28 which is sufficient for two people to indulge in one of their four ( very tasty ) breakfast packages ( e . g .
		3
		juice , tea/coffee , toast , vegetable omelette ) valued at $12-13 approx . so my only suggestion to the management is to do likewise - change your current and future packages from a $14 per room restaurant allowance to ( a more realistic ) $28. note : in the uk , bed and breakfast for any class of hotel has no such restrictions . this would be our only criticism of a deservedly top - notch hotel . previous reviews correctly report on the myriad positives - great location , excellent front desk , excellent tour desk , excellent rooms . . . . . .in fact , excellent everything .

		i stayed on the 12th floor at the back of the hotel and heard very little street noise and got good nights ' sleep - not the case with other hotels in the area ! ! !

		if a good night 's sleep is important to you this is the place to stay .

		2
		everyone greeted us , and were very friendly to my infant son .

		the food was exceptional and the service , as usual for the ritz , was great .

		also , i believe the beach was private which is unusual for puerto rico .
		3
		most hotel chains share the beach with the general public .

		our room was a standard entry level room with partial view of the ocean .

		overall , i feel that it was above average .
		4
		now for the bad ( which really is not too bad ) , i did not feel like the ritz catered to families .
		3
		there was no kiddie pool and the one and only pool was 3 feet deep all around .
		3
		unless you have an inflatable toy for your kids , you will be holding them the entire time .

		i know it 's 90 degrees , but it felt cold when you first got in .

		my son did not enjoy it at all and we had to spend the morning by the pool while my husband visited with family .

		there were no playgrounds for the kids to play or an area where you can let them go wild .

		great mini vacation destination we chose the rcsj for its accessibility (3.5 hours from ny and no immigration lines ) and the usual exectation of high quality from the rc chain .
		4
		the hotel and staff pretty much delivered all that was expected , save for a few exceptions .
		2
		i would very much recommend the rcsj for anyone looking for a quick break in the sun from the east coast of the us . the rcsj delivered on the usual good things : friendly and helpful staff , great lobby and common areas , good dining options in the hotel , clean rooms , nice large pool and beach , great tennis courts and spa .
		3
		however , a couple of suggestions/ comments on what could be improved .
		2
		first , the outside of the hotel needs a clean up .
		3
		the parts facing the ocean need a scrubb and a new lick of paint .
		4
		second , the food options at the pool/ beach could be improved/ expanded , as it 's basically just sandwiches and salads .
		3
		we could not get our perennial favorite of guacamole and chips , which i 'd suggest they add , plus some other nibble - type food .
		3
		third , the pool and beach drinks and food service was average .
		3
		we felt that we had to keep a sharp eye out for a waitress and sometimes it would take 20-30 minutes to get the drink you had ordered !
		2
		a few more staff when it 's busy would help .
		1
		and servers should let you keep the tab open rather than expect you to close it , every time you order a drink .
		0
		finally , the room we had an ocean view ( but only just ) , was fairly small and lacked some of the basics we have enjoyed at other rc hotels ( such as dual sinks and a separate shower cubicle ) .
		3
		while the hotel layout may not accommodate such large rooms , it just did not feel quite up there with other rc 's we have visited . all in , we had a really good time .
		1
		it is the perfect location for a quick weekend in the sun and , with a few relatively minor improvements , the experience could have been outstanding rather than just very good .

		if you are staying more than two people and request ocean view there is no balcony and if your on the 5th floor or lower your view is blocked by the palm trees , if you are looking to stay the pool views rooms are just as good and i believe cheaper . .the dining was expensive but out of this world ( if you love seafood , try the buffet , it is worth the money ) . . .also there are many places within walking distance to eat or go out .

		the classiest hotel in san juan my husband and i stayed at the ritz ( with another couple ) from june 25th to the 29th , and for the most part found this resort to be excellent .
		3
		first of all , the hotel itself is quite pretty , with the lobby area greeting you with full views of the pool area through floor - to - ceiling glass windows about two stories high .
		2
		the pool area was very nice and we did not have any problems finding 4 lounge chairs on our own , or on saturday and sunday with the help of one of the pool attendants ( never neglecting their gratuity , of course ) .
		2
		my husband and his best friend really enjoyed the beach and commented how clean and pleasant it was .
		0
		we celebrated my husband 's 29th birthday on sunday and found the sunday brunch at the caribbean grill excellent , and our waiter even made us a special array of desserts with a candle and a personalized birthday wish .
		3
		we also got a chance to have some services at the spa , which was fine but not what you 'd expect from the ritz carlton chain .
		2
		as far as food is concerned , we ate at both the restaurant by the beach ( ca not remember the name ) and the caribbean grill and found the food well prepared and delicious .
		2
		previous reviews have mentioned prices to be high , which may be somewhat true if you do not keep reminding yourself that you are on vacation and that these prices are somewhat expected for any high - end resort .
		0
		if you are in san juan you really have your pick of some really good food , we visited several restaurants and found la piccola fontana ( in the wyndham el san juan ) , ajili mojili ( in condado ) , casa borinquen and dragonfly ( both in old san juan ) all to be excellent , and all with such different flare ! .apart from housekeeping which was somewhat inconsistent , the service at the ritz is excellent .
		4
		the staff from the bellmen , front desk , conceirge and wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful .
		2
		now on to our only problem with our stay , from our first walk into our balcony room ( # 354) we noticed an awful mildew or mold - like smell .
		3
		the room was very well appointed and of a nice size , and this lingering smell seem to be coming from the carpet .
		4
		on our second day we called housekeeping to ask if something could be done about the smell and because we noticed that the carpet had not been vacummed since we got there .

		the lady on the phone was very polite and apologetic and within 10 minutes there was a housekeeper at our room , vacum in hand and with a very strong but pleasant room deodorizing spray .
		3
		the smell persisted and on our last night there we were awaken by a big leak in the ceiling in the entrance area .
		2
		engineering came to our room about twenty minutes after our phone call to guest services and without even coming into our room , which obviously shows that they were previously aware of this problem , informed us that it would be taking them a very long time to deal with the problem and that we should call the front desk and have our room switched .

		after packing , we were moved to the 7th floor and our room ( # 757) was spotless .

		very nice for what it is : an urban resort we have just returned from a four - day stay at this hotel .
		1
		the previous reviews of this and other san juan hotels left us puzzled , so i thought i 'd try to provide the straight scoop .
		0
		this is a very fine urban resort hotel , with a pleasant beach attached as a bonus .
		0
		there is no question that this is the finest hotel in san juan , and the staff is well trained and generally eager to provide a lovely experience .
		2
		as an added bonus , the hotel is a pleasant five - minute walk from the el san juan , which has fabulous nightlife in its elegant lobby .
		2
		but : this is not the caribbean resort of your dreams - - it is basically urban .
		3
		if you need or want to stay in san juan itself ( as we did ) this is beyond any dispute the finest choice you could make .
		2
		( the closest competitors in san juan , such as the marriott or the water club , are pale imitations of the ritz and nowhere near as nice . )
		0
		however , puerto rico does offer many other high - end beach resorts some distance away - - typically , 1-2 hours drive outside of san juan .
		4
		if you 're looking for a typical luxury caribbean resort , you may be happier at one of those choices ( horned dorset , wyndham in farjado , etc . ) .
		2
		if you have already decided in stay in san juan itself , howver , the ritz is absolutely your best choice .
		3
		btw , if you 're in san juan , go for dinner at pikayo - - rated , for good reason , as one of the top 100 restaurants in the world for 2003.

		still a terrific resort - but affected by the economy this is my 3rd visit ( over the last 12 years ) to el conquistador and while the resort is in need of a face lift , it is a great family getaway .
		2
		if you are looking for a one stop destination - where you do not need to leave the resort to do anything - you??l love it .
		4
		i will start with the pluses - the staff .
		1
		they are sweet , attentive and seem to want to please .
		3
		the golf is phenomenal - and this might be one of a few resorts in pr where there is golf onsite .
		1
		the spa is good - but expensive ( $147 for a 50 minute massage with mandatory added gratuity ) .
		2
		while i always tip the therapist - it is usually commensurate with the quality of the service .
		3
		i happened to have had a great massage but did not run back at the cost for a second service .
		2
		to me the most fun activity is palomino island .
		3
		they tender you over to their private island - where they have beautiful chairs with some umbrellas .
		1
		same drill as most resorts - early bird gets the worm with seating under shade .

		bring a small cooler for this that fits in a bag - they have ice machines near all rooms .
		1
		renting a little noodle was $6 and a raft $11 - bring a few blow up rings or floats for your little guys to save a few bucks there .
		3
		a few cons .
		0
		first the state of the maintenance of the resort is fair .
		0
		examples include facades in need of painting , the hot tub sans bubbles ( no plan to fix i guess ) , floors needing cleaning , pools which could also be cleaner? ? i truly think this is an economic related numbers issue - as occupancy is surely down .
		3
		we laughed as the walk to the lower pool had dirt/hair balls the whole 6 days that just blew around and were never swept - well it is a big resort and must be a nightmare to maintain .
		1
		if you have a teenager as i do - beware as the drinking age is 18 ( not 21) .
		1
		that blew me away and my son and my friends kids bellied up to the bar and drank .
		1
		he?? 19- but i wish i had foreseen this and snuffed it out before we got there .
		1
		plus they had no problems freely serving my 17 year old either .
		1
		scary stuff as a parent .
		2
		every guest gets these charge cards - i wonder if they have a way to restrict them ?
		0
		worth asking - after all , kids will be kids .
		1
		food is very expensive ( what else is new at a resort ) .
		2
		lots of walking there too - i guess an issue if infirmed or elderly .
		3
		rooms could be just a tad cleaner - but the sweet staff taking care of the rooms made up for it .
		2
		also be aware the drive from the airport is long - with traffic could be an hour or more .
		2
		one other con - my husband and son are certified in scuba diving - but my 17 year old is not .
		3
		my 2 sons did get a refresher in the pool - but on their dive the staff was inattentive at best .
		3
		they haphazardly checked their gear - and you better bring your own buddy to dive with as you are on your own .
		2
		that is a little scary .
		1
		tips - bring a bottle of rum/some beer for your room if you like a drink before dinner .
		1
		they have a refrigerator that?? empty .
		3
		bring snacks for the kids - the food is quite expensive and is nice to at least defray some of that .
		2
		we bought rum , wine ( bring a corkscrew ) , beer , cokes - and had a happy hour on our beautiful balconies that saved money .
		0
		i spoke to a guy who rented a car and this gave him eating/drinking/snack flexibility we did not have .
		3
		we booked the garden view - and they kindly gave us a partial and full ocean view - wow .
		3
		we had originally booked partial - changed to garden - that saved us  $1000 each room .
		3
		i recommend the marina location - unless you are a casino person .
		1
		i liked being on the bottom of the funicular .
		1
		after getting off the boat - i saw some people who had to wait in line to go up the mountain .
		3
		you have snorkel gear ?
		1
		bring it and snorkel to the small island next to palomino - my husband and sons did this and said was terrific .
		0
		i kayaked to there too - and it was awesome .
		3
		want to know the deal on the resort ?
		1
		starbucks - yes that?? right .
		3
		the cheapest sandwich seems to be $10- $14 elsewhere .
		1
		the worker said they are the most expensive starbucks on the island - but the hidden secret of the resort .
		4
		the breakfast parfait is maybe $3- the breakfast buffet is ( ready for this ) $25 plus tax and tip .
		3
		let?? face it the food is always outrageous at nice resorts - but beware the dinners are a fortune too ( $45 steak and $11 caesar salad ) .
		0
		what else ? well we ended up not doing the luminescence tour in the kayaks - but figured out if you walk around the corner ( to the left of where you get on the boat ) - is ? the cost as opposed to booking through the resort ( $44 versus $88 or something like that ) .
		2
		my other tip is the lower pool - kind of hidden but very relaxing versus the noisy upper pool .
		1
		you know they have this water park - but our kids were maybe a little too old for it and i guess the $20 cost put them off ( versus them sneaking daiquiris - go figure ) .
		3
		i hope this information helps - i am always so indebted to tips i get from other reviews - so thanks to all of you .

		we spoke at least 3 times to specifically make sure that the carseat would be the right size , etc .

		one night we ate at blossoms ( japanesse place ) and it was $160 for 3 people and 1 glass of wine - way over board for mediocre food . when we return next year , we will plan to have dinner off property more often until the hotel gets the hint . we did have a great time and the room we had ( las brias wing ) was clean , spacious and very comfortable .

		i read a few of the reviews here on tripadvisor , and have to say they were mostly accurate and very helpful in managing my expectations . the hotel is huge ( close to 1,000 rooms , several buildings ) and does cater heavily to corporate groups .

		during my stay , there were bankers and insurance agents .
		3
		it does offer all the horrors of an over - built , extremely touristy place with the expected customer base .

		and just as most of the reviewers on tripadvisors said , the employees are friendly/helpful , and the place is big enough to escape whatever scene you want to avoid .
		1
		yes , the food is not cheap , but they have enough restaurants on premise to choose from , hi - end to mid - range .
		2
		what 's weird is things like bottled water have a wide price range depending on where you buy it .
		3
		beyond price , you ca not come here thinking you 're in for a gastronomic treat .
		3
		the food , at best , is ok , and if you come from a place that 's food - obsessed ( ny , chicago , sf , la , etc . ) , you will be disappointed .
		0
		for me , the best part was the access to their 'private ' island ( i doubt they really own it . . . it also allows non - hotel guets to visit especially if they come by their own boats ) via high - speed boats that simply go back and forth from 9 am till 5:30 pm .
		4
		similar to the hotel , even though it 's a small island with limited beach real estate , you can still find a way to 'escape ' the mob .
		4
		a quick hike up and then down a dirt road leads you to a completely deserted patch of beach ( there are two such 'coves ' as indicated on the island map ) , where i was every day .
		2
		every now and then another hiker or two would come around , but otherwise i had the small patch to myself and really liked it .

		they did not seem to care that the other patrons in the restaurant were being tortured . pasion was fabulous , we ate there 2 times .
		0
		metropol was good , la estacion was just ok .
		0
		funky atmosphere , but the food was just ok .
		3
		we only went to palomino once and it was nice but alot of work to get to from las casitas .
		1
		we had a rental car ( from charleys , they were great to deal with ) and it paid for itself in a week .
		3
		we went to luquillo beach which was fabulous , seven seas beach was beautiful .
		3
		we even ate lunch at the kiosks on luquillo beach which was great , and cheap .
		3
		having a rental car really helps make the visit more pleasurable . i 'd recommend this hotel with some reservations but overall we had a great time .

		had a great president 's day weekend i 've read all the reviews on this web site before and after our trip .
		3
		overall i 'd say they are fairly accurate , it is possible to have a wonderful stay at the el conquistador at a very reasonable cost .
		2
		we upgraded to a newly renovated room in las brisas , which had brand new ultramodern furniture ( and white lcd tv ) and a spectacular view .
		3
		when we were there they had a sign at the check in desk offering this .
		2
		also by staying in the central part of the large property , nothing was very far away .
		1
		we actually took evening walks all around for exercise and to enjoy the lovely grounds , stars and fresh air .
		3
		the newly renovated exercise room ( included in the resort charge ) was great with a view of the water .
		0
		i am a golfer and i really enjoyed the course .
		1
		it was great to have a championship layout instead of a resort course .
		2
		i played once at 1pm for a much more reasonable $100 and once at 3:30 for $70 ( rather than the normal $175) .
		2
		the times i played the course was pretty empty ( except for the plentiful iguanas everywhere ) i also hit balls on the range for $15 ( a little pricey but i got my money 's worth with unlimited balls ) .
		1
		wife and daughter used the spa once which they enjoyed . we did not spend time at the main pools which were quite crowded and more of the 3.5 to 4 star ambience .
		3
		we loved the island including the ferry ride .
		3
		yes it takes awhile to get there , its an island out in the ocean .
		1
		the boats were modern and fast . food was about what we expected , we alternated breakfasts between the cafe caribe ( coffee shop ) in the lobby and the las brisas buffet .
		3
		prices in the cafe were pretty reasonable for basic breakfasts .
		2
		buffet was high at $25 , although we enjoyed the great fruit and omlettes and ate enough to skip lunch . the fresh local catch at stingray 's ( dorado and tuna ) was excellent and we went there twice for the same thing .
		3
		the other hotel restaurants did not appeal to us and appeared pretty expensive .
		3
		one night we had salads and pizzas outside which was all we wanted .
		2
		i played texas hold em in the casino ( they have one table ) and it was fun .
		2
		in room internet was very fast if expensive at $15 a day .
		2
		service is available in the lobby for $5/hr , pcs or wifi . staff was great all around . just dont expect a five star experience , until the new owners are able to complete their capital improvements .
		3
		we met lots of families and they were having a great time .

		nice place this was my second time here .
		3
		i was with my wife and a bunch of other couples .
		2
		the hotel itself needs some updating but the grounds are beautiful .
		1
		the food was very good and the staff was very pleasant .
		2
		the views are magnificent .
		1
		the beach , which you have to go to by boat (8 min ride ) was very nice .

		great vacation !
		1
		ok , i felt compelled to check back on this site to see what had been written laterly , and really felt compelled to post another opinion based on our stay . we went to el conquistador december 26 - jan 1.
		0
		our experience was remarkably different from most overall , but consistent in some areas . . . .we do christmas week in the caribbean every year and have somehow become accustomed to overpaying for our hotel , but this is always the best time for us to travel with our 7- year old who is in school . we had a great time !
		3
		the resort was packed with families , many from the northeast .
		1
		the vibe during the whole week was very enthusiastically holiday , and fun . here are some specifics : - - - our hotel room was great , actually .
		3
		they upgraded us from garden view to partial oceaan view .
		3
		yes , they are renovating , but they are doing one entire wing at one time , which is not seen by those stayin at the hotel .
		1
		a new wing is being consteucted , but it does not get in the way of any view or walking path in the entire resort .
		1
		our room was clean , well taken care of by housekeeping .
		1
		many new room amenities - coffee maker , refrigerators , blowdryers , sound system , etc .
		2
		little things , but they are definitely trying to update the rooms as quickly as possible .
		2
		it appeared that all our towels and bedding ( down comforters and duvet ) were brand new .
		0
		- - - they brought us happy holiday gift basket the first night with lots of local treats and snacks , it was very nice . - - -
		3
		on the first day at palomino island , we did need to wait for about 25 minutes for a ferry , but it was because the line for transport to the island was so long , and they limit the number of passengers on each ferry .
		4
		the ferry consistently ran every 20 - 30 minutes , and we watched as they tested new 8- minute ferry boats which will be used soon . - - -
		3
		palomino island was gorgeous , and quite busy each day .
		3
		the first two days after christmas were packed - not many available chairs ( and there are hundreds ) but after that , the crowds slimmed down .
		2
		they had wait staff bringing lunch and drinks to your chairs , had bands , and organized volleyballs games , even a sand castle contest for the kids on our last day . we even rented a car to try out other local beaches ( loquillo ) and the rain forest .
		3
		we left and went back to palomino . - - -
		0
		there was only one time one of the funiculars going down to the marina area was broken and it was fixed within 15 minutes .
		2
		if you have thousands of people taking anything up and down or back and forth 24/7 there will be problems .
		2
		and the staff quickly fixed it . - - -
		3
		we agreed with everyone else that the restaurants were just ridiculously over - priced .
		2
		just outrageous .
		4
		food was ok .
		0
		we went to otello 's ( just ok ) , stingray ( our best meal there ) and strip house ( ok ) .
		1
		we 're lucky to live in a city with great restaurants and have pretty high standards .
		0
		so we were disappointed by the food for the price , but we took another reviews advice and bought food for snacks and breakfast .
		1
		they should have kids ' meals at kids ' pricing .
		1
		$12 for buttered bow tie pasta is just manslaughter .
		3
		yes , i am embarassed to say that we paid that but sometimes on vacation you are irrational and say what the hell .
		3
		some nights we just ordered a pizza .
		1
		we ate outside the resort and the hotel has a list for you to try .
		0
		we ate at con pepe ( i think that 's the name ) near the entrance ot the westin and it was amazing , and much more reasonable . - - -
		1
		in general , the pricing for snacks , candy and drinks , even at the convenience store there , was about 4 times what you would expect to pay , even at the local stores ( $3.99 for a bag of lays chips already marked as $1.39.
		3
		$ 3.89 for usa today .
		1
		that kind of thing ) - - - the pools and grounds were beautiful .
		3
		- - - our daughter did not do the kids ' club , but we heard glowing reviews and the first few days there were about 20 kids in teh club participating in activities .
		4
		each night they had movies and other games to keep kids busy .
		0
		we were lucky to hook up with parents who had kids of similar ages , so making friends while there was not a problem for our 7- year old . - - -
		3
		transportation from the airport was timely , nice , with drinks on board , but very expensive ( $178 round trip for 3) . - - -
		3
		we dive and snorkel , and had a good experience with casa del mar , the padi group on site . - - -
		1
		staff for baggage was just waiting to please .
		3
		falling over themselves .
		4
		it was great .
		0
		we called on night for packs of coffee , not really expecting someone in housekeeping to have 3 packs at our door within 10 minutes .
		1
		they had turn down service each evening and were exceedingly polite with every request we made . i hope to post some images as soon as i get the time to download our cameras .
		2
		hope this helps !

		great place to relax and enjoy the resort my wife and i stayed at the el conquistador for our 1 year anniversary oct 1st -6th .
		4
		we read all the reviews prior to taking our trip so alot of it was expected .
		1
		i think in general , all the reviews are accurate . weather - near the end of hurricane season , we were somewhat worried about the weather , but it was 85-90 each day partly cloudy .
		3
		when the sun was out , it was hot , there was a breeze by the pool and also on the island . food - the food is expensive .
		2
		$10-15 for a burger , $25-45 for a dinner entree .
		2
		however , the food is good quality .
		3
		actually the breakfast at the caribe cafe was priced pretty well $6-9 for entrees , and the coffee shops had bagels , muffins that we priced ok .
		2
		so you could start the day off with a good meal and a good price .
		1
		we did not do the buffett at las brisas , as it was closed ( i think it was $20 a person anyhow ) .we found the ballyhoo bar and grill at the marina to have the best lunch menu and moderate prices .
		3
		the burgers , sandwiches and quesadillas were all good .
		3
		the main grill on palomino was closed and the secondary grill was ok , but the prices were higher .
		4
		alot of people have said good things about the pizza at the pool , but we did not think it was too good .
		1
		dinner at otellos ( italian ) was very good .
		0
		dinner at blossoms ( chinese ) was ok .
		2
		i think if they just lowered some of their prices $5- $10, they 'd have no complaints .
		3
		hotel - as with others at this time , we were in the la vistas section , we originally had a garden view , but they gave us a free upgrade to an ocean view , which overlooked the main pool/ocean and with a nice balcony .
		1
		the sunrise comes up on this side .
		2
		the room itself was in need of an upgrade .
		3
		just older stuff , it would be a nice room with renovations .
		0
		they are doing major renovations to other parts of the hotel ( bristas wing ) so i assume , they 'll upgrade this one once the other is done .
		3
		renovations of rooms and a waterpark are said to be completed in 2006-2007.
		3
		they are also updating their boats .
		4
		in the offseason , it definately is a much more laid back hotel .
		3
		it 's like you have it to yourself , so it 's quiet .
		2
		some of the restaurants are closed , since there are not that many people but there are still plenty of choices .
		3
		we spent a day by the main pool and that was nice , as we were close to our hotel room , and also close to the pool bar and servers .
		3
		we also found the infinity pool in the casitas , and that was a great view as well .
		2
		i could see how these would be crowded in the main season .
		2
		i thought it was pretty easy to get around with the funicular ( tram ) to take you to the marina section and the boat to take you to palomino island .
		3
		we enjoyed the boat ride .
		1
		we spent a couple days out at palomino island .
		3
		it 's definately pretty cool to have your own island .
		3
		we took the first 9am ride out in the morning and along with a couple other people had the island to ourselves .
		3
		there are plenty of towels/chairs/umbrellas to use on the island .
		2
		it 's set up pretty well .
		3
		the water does have coral in it , so at times the bottom is rocky .
		3
		we did find a nice patch further out that became smooth sand again .
		3
		so try to go past the 1st section .
		0
		if it 's hot and you want a breeze , go right when getting off the boat ( best beach also ) .
		3
		but if the wind picks up and it get 's cloudy , stay on the left side or close to the dock ( less wind ) .
		3
		spa - my wife loved the spa .
		3
		she said it was very worth the money .
		3
		she got a 60 minute massage .
		3
		she highly recommends the services there .
		0
		she said the massage was great and the setting was perfect . golf - i guess on tues/thurs during the offseason they have discounted rates on golf after 1pm .
		1
		so it was $70 to play 18. ( they are in the processes of building a 9 hole course ) .
		0
		the golf course is really nice and all the tee boxes are positioned high , so alot of your drives will go quite a bit further 100-150 yards .
		2
		it 's pretty interesting .
		2
		the course was very well taken care of .
		2
		the fairways are pretty straight and open , so it 's an easy course to play .
		3
		lots of iguanas roaming the fairways which goes along with the views of the mountains .
		0
		all in all , this hotel is a good choice .
		0
		i think once the renovations are completed , it may be a great hotel .
		3
		in the offseason it 's a good choice for relaxing and water sports .
		4
		i would not recommend it for night life if that 's what your looking for or for socializing , as there are not many people there ( i 'm speaking about the offseason ) .but for a getaway of sun , surf , pools , golf , spa and food , it 's a good choice .
		2
		also , the staff at the hotel was very friendly and attentive .
		3
		**ps , if you connect in ny at jfk for jetblue , the san juan connection is in terminal 4, you have to take a shuttle train which can take time**

		a fantastic resort and island let me start of by saying if you travel to the el con you will have a wonderful vacation .
		4
		pleas do not believe all the negative hype on the site .
		4
		it?? just not true .
		0
		we recently returned from an 8 night stay at the resort and found that it met or exceeded our expectations .
		0
		we had a party of 7 (4 adults , 3 children ages 10, 13 and 14) .
		1
		we are from nj and ct and have traveled to many locals with and with our children over the years .
		3
		we can be picky but i must say everyone had an enjoyable time .
		0
		here 's the deal - we arrived at the resort tuesday july 25th .
		1
		we rented a minivan which i would suggest doing .
		2
		it gave us the freedom to explore and go off the resort to local restaurants for dinner .
		2
		the hotel shuttle is about $66 r/t per person .
		3
		our two families split the rental which came to about $250 per family and we had use of a car all week long .
		3
		they do charge daily for parking but i suggest when you depart you ask for some of that to be removed from the bill .
		1
		we waited for our car from valet one night for about 45min .
		1
		we mentioned that before we checked out and were only charged 3 nights for parking .
		4
		the staff is very accommodating but you 'll have to put in a little time and effort to get exactly what you want/except .
		2
		check - in was somewhat slow .
		0
		the rooms we had been promised were booked ( in the las brisas bldg ) .
		2
		apparently there was a large wedding taking place over the weekend and the entire building had been reserved .
		2
		they put us in the vista wing of the hotel overlooking the pool with a spectacular ocean view .
		3
		these rooms were a bit smaller than what we had reserved .
		0
		the told us they could move us on thursday to a newer building adjacent to the vistas .
		1
		this building had larger rooms ( king bed with pull - out couch ) and had 6 floors instead of 4 and a balcony .
		4
		they put us on the 6th floor .
		0
		i suggest this part of the resort or las brisas when traveling with kids .
		1
		the resort is large and you will be in a central locale to all the resort has to offer .
		3
		the rooms we were in were not falling apart .
		3
		they were very clean ; beds were comfortable and not really outdated .
		2
		the bathroom was quite large and in great shape .
		1
		ac worked well too .
		3
		the resort has many restaurants .
		4
		the prices tend to be somewhat expensive but no more than you would pay at any other resort .
		2
		i must say that we didn?? have one bad meal at the resort .
		1
		the food was very good .
		3
		you can do a casual meal outside on the patio overlooking the pool or a more formal one at stingrays or blossoms .
		0
		do yourself a favor .
		2
		get some food for the room like bagels , cereal etc if you want to save a bit of money .
		3
		the room has a coffee machine .
		0
		we also bought some rum and beer on hand to make drinks .
		4
		the only issue i has was paying $5.50 for a bottle of beer .
		4
		go to the local supermarket and get a styrofoam cooler for $2.00 and fill it up .
		2
		rooms also have small refrigerators too .
		0
		the pools were clean and refreshing .
		3
		there are 3 pools and a waterslide on the main level .
		0
		i would also suggest going over to las casitas to swim in the infinity pool .
		3
		although it states that only guests of the casitas can utilize the pool , we went several times and were handed towels from the staff .
		2
		no one will bother you .
		3
		it?? a beautiful pool with a magnificent view .
		3
		palomino island was also a favorite among our group .
		0
		taking the boat ride to the island is fun and enjoyable .
		3
		once you arrive on the beautiful island , everything you need is there .
		1
		food , drinks , lounge chairs , towels , snorkeling gear , jet skis etc etc .
		3
		the beach is a bit rocky when entering the water but once you get into the beautiful caribbean , you??l forget all about it .
		3
		the resort is going through a $95 million renovation .
		3
		i will admit it does need some tlc here and there but you will not get the spectacular views , beautiful beaches and above average accommodations at another resort in puerto rico .
		3
		we all enjoyed our vacation and all agreed it was well worth the money spent .
		1
		ps - don?? miss out on the bio bay tour , it?? so close to the hotel .
		1
		ask the concierge to give you the info for island tours .
		2
		ask for havier .
		0
		it was a fantastic experience

		my husband and i stayed at this resort for a trip i had won through southern living at home .
		0
		i have to say that i was very nervous with all the bad reviews of this hotel but the trip was free so of course , we took the chance .
		3
		the bus ride is a long one , but i caught a nap !

		our check in was a little bit different since the resort was sold out for slah .

		0
		i had to stand in another line to see if my room was ready and finally it was at around 4:30ish .

		3

		3
		the only other place we ate at was at stingray .
		1
		the food was excellent and the prices not too out of line .
		2
		waiting for a taxi is an issue , we had to wait for an hour to get a taxi and found out later that we could have walked there ( which we did on the way back ) .
		1
		the conceriege did not relay this info to us but we went to ocean view .
		3
		if you are looking for a quick dinner , you wo not get it there but the food is great , it appears to be a hole in the wall that is family owned but again , you are not there for the atmosphere !
		0
		we all laughed about it later , i think we were there about 2 1/2 hours .
		1
		they do the best the can and we were glad we went . there are definitely some negatives to this resort but some awesome positives .
		2
		we had no problem at all taking the ferry over to the island , we did have to stand in line at times but we loved the island .
		0
		there are wild rabbits there that are huge and they will walk right up to you and let you feed them .
		3
		that was cool .
		3

		0
		the other side is extremely breezy and the beach is rocky rather than seaweed .
		3
		lots of people were finding starfish in the water .
		2
		some idiots decided to take them home which we knew was illegal but they do not seem to realize that a living creature is inside the starfish .
		3
		we played with our for awhile and swam around with it and it 's awesome how gently it latches on to your hand and is very flexible in your palm , we of course put it back where we found it .
		2
		we did spot several jellyfish so be careful and i got a great glimpse of a large stingray .
		2
		we snorkeled of course , it 's better snorkeling on the other side where it is breezy but be sure to bring your water shoes . overall , great trip since it was free and the views are spectacular .

		being more prepared with snacks going in would be good to save some money !

		having said that we thought the meals were very good and we were on vacation and ready to spend the money realizing we were at a resort which usually means big bucks for the food .
		3
		we actually made an excursion into town and bought things like water , soda , chips , wine etc .
		0
		it helped offset some of the expenses .
		3
		we also ordered room services for dinner a few times which saved us a few bucks and we had romantic dinners on our terrace . the positives :1) the layout of the resort and the location is awesome .

		you can always find a lounge chair and never feel like you are on top of other visitors . we just really had a nice time . . . .other hints : go to the rain forest its only about a 15 minute drive away . . . plan a trip to the casa bacardi - - - lots of fun and the tours are free ! ! rent a car at the airport .
		3
		you can get a car for about a $300 a wk and park it at the hotel for $15 a day .

		beautiful hotel .
		4
		the el conquistador is a beautiful hotel , and i would highly recommend it to anyone staying in puerto rico .

		we did not have any problems with check - in , or with the staff .
		3
		the pool are is very nice and it has great views of the ocean .

		0
		i have stayed in many hotels in the caribbean and all of the restaurants are overpriced .
		3
		i ate at stingrays - fish , otello 's - italian , blossoms - chinese and japanese , and isabella 's - international .
		3
		all of these restaurants were very good .
		3
		we waited a long time for our food , but that is expected during easter week .
		3
		the one downside to this hotel was getting to the beach .
		1
		the hotel is on a high cliff so you first must take a funicular to the marina at the bottom of the cliff .
		3
		then you must take a ferry which runs about every 20 min .
		3
		to palomino island .
		3
		palomino island is beautiful but the trip is inconvenient .

		one of my favorite resorts we just got home from this resort ( our 5th visit ) and we did notice some problems so we talked to many of the staff people and they informed us of the many new changes that are coming now that wyndham no longer owns them .
		3
		apparently , the new ownership plans to remodel every room , build a new funicular that will cut across the high hill , build a new water park for children , have an adult only pool , etc .
		3
		in two years these changes will make it the wonderful and elegant destination it 's always been .
		3
		they do not intend to raise rooms rates as they recognize that they 're high already .
		3
		they want people to get what they pay for in service and room appointments .
		1
		we intend to go back in two years to see all these new changes , in the meantime hang in there , they 're working on it .

		wonderful relaxing get - away my husband and i just returned from a 4 night stay at the el con where we had a wonderful , relaxing caribbean get - away .
		3
		based on the wide range of prior reviews , i was a bit anxious about the place but can now heartily recommend this resort to those seeking magnificent scenery and a relaxed atmosphere .
		0
		overall , we found the accommodations to be comfortable , clean , and spacious .
		2
		we were initially booked into an ocean view room in la vistas overlooking the pool area which was adequate .
		4
		however , the hotel staff were very accommodating in moving us upon request to las brisas wing to a more spacious room with a balcony providing a better view and secluded feel .
		4
		las brisas is very convenient to the main hotel area with pools , casino , restaurants , as well as to the funicular to access the marina .
		3
		yes , the furniture is a bit dated and there were just a few stains on the carpet , but easily overlooked in comparison to the positives .
		1
		in terms of service , the staff were helpful , polite , and efficient . . . but you do have to account for island time and not put yourself on a tight schedule .
		3
		we had better luck with face - to - face requests versus trying to get staff on the phone . we opted to rent a jeep at the airport and were very glad we did as it gave us flexibility to sightsee , tour el yunque rain forest on our time table ( this sight is a must for nature lovers ) , and cut down on eating expenses by purchasing drinks , wine , and snacks at a nearby grocery store .
		3
		one warning , driving in puerto rico is not for the faint - hearted .
		3
		the jeep came in very handy given the road conditions .
		3
		if you can get off property , i would highly recommend the food and service of el pasions restaurant located just down the road .
		1
		be prepared to pay resort prices for all food on site .
		3
		we did enjoy a superb seafood meal at stingrays ( at the marina ) . . .the atmosphere , food quality , and service were well worth the price . the beach at palomino island was very enjoyable and well cared for .
		3
		if you decide to snorkle , i would suggest going on the morning excursion as the afternoon anchored at only one site .
		3
		again , if you slow down and enjoy , you will not consider the boat ride over to the island or the funicular to be an inconvenience .
		3
		although we took the advice of others and closely checked our bill upon checking out , we found no inaccuracies .
		3
		this resort is not for the penny concious but i would highly recommend it to others and would go again in a heart beat .

		beautiful property !
		3
		after reading all of the reviews of the hotel , i was very excited to be able to see it first hand and give my own opinion .
		3
		i 've been in the hotel business for many years and done a lot of traveling to various places and various types of properties .
		3
		overall , it was a very enjoyable trip .
		0
		the facility is beautiful ( grounds , pools , island etc . )
		4
		it is older , but pretty well kept up , not perfect , but certainly very nice .
		3
		the only real complaint for our two families that visited were the guest rooms .
		2
		they were tired .
		3
		not dirty , just older .
		4
		bedspreads and carpt were fine .
		1
		but , when tile and furnishings get older , they are hard to keep looking fresh .
		3
		we had one room with ocean view in the las vistas building and one overlooking the marina in that section .
		1
		both just need some perking up and new furnishings .
		3
		the bathrooms need new tile etc .
		3
		when you pay these prices . . . you do want to have a very plush room to go along with it . the nicer restaurants were expensive , but you have other options at all times .
		4
		we enjoyed blossoms ( asian ) , isabelas ( steakhouse ) and stingray ( seafood ) .
		3
		anyone that says that there were no other options , did not take the time to look for them .
		3
		if you did not want to spend the money on the finer dining restaurants in the evening , then you certainly could have enjoyed bella vista ( over the pool ) , the cafe , or the marina restaurant .
		1
		if you did not want to have the breakfast buffet , there is a cafe or a couple of different places to get quick things .
		1
		we thought lunch on the island was fantastic !
		1
		probably the best fish and chips i ever had !
		3
		prices were a bit high . . . but not for resort standards .
		3
		we did not get a chance to enjoy the burger place at the main pool . . . but heard it was great !
		0
		the childrens menus were very reasonable everywhere . it was high season , but we never had trouble getting chairs , umbrellas , or towels .
		3
		we found the workers very nice .
		1
		service is slow . . . again , pretty standard for that area .
		3
		but , everyone was very pleasant .
		2
		we were not charged for anything that we did not order and felt completely safe everywhere we went .
		2
		the property is undergoing a lot of renovation over the next couple of years and will be very fun to visit again when it is complete .
		2
		but , i would not hesitate going back before then .

		1
		dinner at any place is $80 - $120 for two .

		a wonderful trip with a 3 yr .
		1
		old , but all reviews true ! well i had changed my resort from the dorado to the conquistador and i am glad i did because it was great for my 3 yr old , but before i get into the kid aspect i will give you my most honest opinions . the conquistador is no longer a wyndham hotel its now owned by a new company ( blackstone group i think its called ) so i was a little concerned upon starting our vacation , but there was no way to know that it had changed especially since everything still said wyndham on itand they did honor our wyndham by request card !
		0
		the transfer provided from the hotel was great clean and efficient , it was a 45- to an hour drive to resort , but a pleasant drive .
		4
		when we arrived at the hotel we were checked in and taken to our room .
		1
		this is the part of the review that rings true about the staff issues . we were taken to our room down by the marina .
		3
		the bellman took us the back way to our room , i was mortified he took us the way of the help all i kept thinking was what kind of resort is this no flowers , no palm trees it was horrible .
		0
		when we reached our room there was mold everywhere the paint peeling in the bathroom and dust caked on the vents , all i could think was what kind of hole did i pick for us to vacation in ! the bellman then went to show me the armoire and the door fell off !
		1
		the bellman then skooted off as if everything was fine  we did not even matter and this was a normal hotel room ( mind you this was the deluxe oceanview ) i immediatley called the front desk upset and said this was not ok .
		0
		now i understand that i am on island time but i had a hungry and tired husband  child well anyway 45 minutes later they moved us to a much , much nicer room that was clean and really nice with a great view .
		2
		i have to be honest the newer staff were alot more accomodating and helpful than more senior employees .
		0
		i think the only other big issue i had was that no one came to take away old roomservice for almost 48hrs trays just sat with left overs and soon enough a glass was smashed in front of our room .
		0
		its almost as if roomservice clean up had no importance throughout the marina area its strange ! but
		4
		i noticed people started putting their trays by the icemachines just to get it away from thier doors !
		0
		but anyway besides that we had an incredible time .
		3
		the food was pricey but very good , we were disappointed that there was mexican food but not puerto rican .

		the hotel itself is large and if you are physically limited ( bad back etc . ) i 'd rethink it .
		2
		the views were spectacular the overall cleanliness was very good in the resturants and bathrooms .

		the little shops were great to shop in !
		2
		the art work and sculptures in the hotel were beautiful . the outdoor cafes were relaxing and lovely !
		1
		now onto my favorite part palomino island . i loved it , we all loved it was like a getaway each day within your vacation . the ride to the island was maybe 10 min .
		1
		and it was a beautiful ride .
		4
		nothing could be more beautiful ! it was just perfect for us snorkeling off the beach and the water was so calm my little one could just wade in it without any problem .
		3
		the water was so clear that you could watch the fish swim around you , my 3 year old loved it !
		2
		it was a very child friendly beach ! ! !
		3
		all of the restaurants had chocolate milk and kids meals so that was great and the waiters at the cafe caribe were great with my child , very friendly and quick great service .
		1
		the breakfast buffet at la brisa was great and it only ran us $44 before the tip .
		1
		i have to say all of the waitstaff we encountered were very good !
		3
		funicular was a blast for my my child , it worked great and was very clean .
		3
		we rented a car one day ! i would not recommend it the roads are lawless until you get to the highway and that is if you can find the highway there are no signs , not stop signs , no yield signs and no traffic lights it was crazy and we gave up rather quickly especially once we ended up in the town of fajardo . leave driving to savy travelers .
		0
		the pools were located nearby to all the different areas they were treated every morning and always clean .
		3
		we would definatly go back to this resort because it was a great safe place for a little one and incredibly relaxing .
		3
		the front desk was very accomodating as were the waitstaff , i think that just as in any hotel some people love their jobs more than others ! !
		3
		if you want a nice quiet getaway this is the place to go ! ! !

		the good/the bad at wyndham rio mar we just returned tonight ( jan . 5th ) from an 8 day stay with our older kids ( two 20- year - olds , one 17- year - old ) from the wyndham rio mar . we joined wyndham rewards , and were upgraded to two ocean front rooms which were very spacious , with extremely comfortable beds , small flat screen tvs , and average size bathrooms that thankfully , unlike other caribbean resorts , never ran out of hot water for the shower . the hotel is on the atlantic side of puerto rico , so the water is not the calm blue/green of the caribbean .
		3
		in some ways , that was a plus , since there were gigantic waves to play in , although we all had to be careful of a considerable undertow . the beach itself is just ok .
		3
		it 's nearly two miles long , so good for a jog back and forth , but some days , especially one end of it was littered with cigarette butts and plastic cups . hotel food was mediocre to poor , except for the italian restaurant palio , and even that did not compare favorably to the most basic pizzeria in new york .
		3
		prices were high for all food except the hot dog/hamburger grill set up near the pool for lunch . luckily , we rented a car , because the hotel is in a gated community that is pretty isolated .

		excellent stay my wife and i spent 6 days 5 nights at the rio mar in october 2008.
		1
		we had a great time and weather was fantastic .
		3
		the grounds of the rio mar are spectacular .
		3
		booked deal through a discount website and for the price well worth the money ( flight , room and transfers for total of $1,500) .

		we both feel that puerto rico gets a bum rap in the states .

		the island is beautiful and the people were very friendly and just a 3.5 hour flight from the new york area .

		very enjoyable stay we visited wyndham rio mar towards the end of september in 2008.
		1
		overall i would rate the experience very good .
		3
		i would not consider it a ??uxury? ? hotel
		3
		( ala ritz or four seasons ) , but it certainly is far and away better than your average hotel .
		3
		we didn?? experience any of the extreme negatives that some of the other reviewers ran into . our trip was booked through cheapcaribbean . com
		0
		the experience starts when you drive in the main gate at the top of a hill , and you get an incredible view of the resort and the ocean .
		2
		as you drive to the main building , you see the golf - course and very well - manicured landscaping .
		0
		like some other people reported , the self - parking was a little hard to find ( even in daylight ) , but that?? just because of poor signage .

		2
		not only do you save $5/day ( plus the tip you?? give to a valet ) , but i suspect that you??e probably in your car quicker than if you used the valet . on a side note , the rental car is well worth it ( we picked up our avis car at the airport - $200 ( including taxes and fees ) for 5 days ) .
		0
		when you factor in what the hotel would charge for the round - trip hotel to the shuttle ( $30 per person , each way ) , it?? not much more to have your own car ? ? especially if you want to leave the hotel for any sightseeing on your own ( rain forest , old san juan , local restaurants ) .
		2
		don?? think you can walk any place ? ? it?? probably close to two miles from the front - door of the hotel to ??own? ? (it?? probably a mile just from the front door to the main gate ) .our check - in was quick and easy , with no hassles .
		2
		i politely inquired about an upgrade ( from ocean - view to ocean - front ) , and after some discussion was given one at no charge .
		3
		the room is nothing extraordinary , but very nice ( clean , decent size , nicely decorated ) , but with a magnificent view , and a terrace with 2 chairs and a table .
		2
		it includes a dresser , a desk , flat - screen tv , cordless phone , stall shower and bathtub , mini - bar , safe , good - size closet , hair dryer , iron and ironing board , internet connection ( $14/day ) and chair/ottoman to relax in . we found the staff to be friendly , polite , professional , and eager to help ( this includes everyone from concierges to house - keeping staff ) .
		0
		however , at the concierge desk , it seemed to be hit or miss about how much they knew regarding the various tours .
		4
		we never ran into any crowds at the pool , the restaurants , or the casino .
		4
		in fact , all the facilities seemed to be pretty sparsely used , and there were even some empty tables at the casino ( black jack tables start at $5) .
		4
		of course , this is probably largely due to the fact that we went in the off - season . the hotel offers a number of tours/excursions ( snorkeling , rain forest , trip to old san juan , bio bay , etc . ) .
		2
		one of my disappointments was that info about tours was not really comprehensively presented with sufficient detail , so you had to ask a lot of questions of the concierge ( and like i said before , different people at the concierge desk seemed to have different pieces of info ) .
		2
		however , they did advise us that we could save some money by using our own car .
		2
		for example , the bio bay tour is $80 per person if you use the hotel shuttle , but we paid $52 by using our own car .
		3
		similarly , the hotel charges $38 per person for a trip to the rain forest , but if you drive yourself there is no cost ( although the visitor?? center is $3/person ) .
		2
		i did want to do snorkeling , but everything they had was a full day , and i would??e preferred something that was just 3-4 hours .
		2
		while we were there , the concierge staff kept trying to get us to attend some sort of sales - seminar ( in return for a 5- day/4- night stay at the wyndham in st . john?? ) ? ? but there was little pressure , and they stopped when we politely said ??o thanks . ? ? br/>regarding food , i would agree with the others that it is good , but nothing special , and over - priced ( probably on average of about 20% ) .
		2
		for example , whether you do the breakfast buffet or order - off - the - menu , you??l pay about $19/head .
		2
		a turkey club - sandwich was $12.
		0
		we ate at marbella?? several times ( shrimp asapao was very good ) and found the food to be good , and the service to be very - good ( with a very friendly wait - staff ) .
		1
		palio?? was closed while we were there ( apparently they close one of the restaurants during the off - season ) .
		1
		we also ate at shima?? ( seafood power stew as appetizer , and filet mignon entr?e was very good ) , the tiki bar and the sea breeze ( both outdoor by the pool ) and all were good .
		2
		the hotel?? main bar is right in the main lobby .
		1
		in the evening it can get kind of loud and some of the noise can be heard in the restaurants .
		2
		a concierge recommended richie?? restaurant , which we went to for dinner .
		2
		the food was ok at best , but very pricey for a restaurant that has zero - atmosphere ( it is essentially a large covered outdoor patio ) .
		4
		it is located high on a hill and has a magnificent view .
		3
		we?? recommend it for a drink in the afternoon , or during sunset , but certainly not for a real meal ( and the view pretty much disappears after dark ) .
		2
		however , it should be noted that richie?? does offer free car service to/from the hotel . we don?? play golf or tennis , but if you do , it seems that these facilities here are great .
		3
		i was disappointed that there doesn?? seem to be any of the usual beach activities available ( jet - ski , banana - boat , para - sailing ) .
		3
		this seems to be true of all the resorts in the area , and someone had mentioned that those sort of power - boats are prohibited to protect the coral .
		2
		the pools and beaches were very clean and enjoyable .
		2
		the slide at the pool is a lot of fun . you don?? need any spanish within the hotel ( except perhaps to talk to the ladies in housekeeping cleaning the rooms ) .
		2
		however , if you are bi - lingual , the staff certainly seems to appreciate it .

		i really love this hotel and its location .
		3
		here are some tips : i recommend that you apply for the wyndham by request program .
		2
		it provides you with various ammenities you otherwise would not get .
		4
		on this trip we were welcomed with a $45.00 bottle of wine , water for the children and some snacks .
		3
		use this program if you are traveling with small children .
		0
		by calling ahead and pushing my membership i was given a small refrigerator and microwave to use with no charge .
		3
		( if you are going to fill up the fridge , i recommend that you shop at amigo .
		3
		i thought walmart would be cheaper , but it really was not . )
		2
		we were also given a room upgade - from resort view to ocean view .
		1
		although the restauraunts @ the resort are pricey , they are worth it , especially palio .
		3
		( if you plan ahead buy yourself an entertainment book for puerto rico and there are coupons in there for restaurants ( buy one meal , get one free ) , tee times , and water sports .
		0
		also , be advised if you book through orbitz , there is a $30 resort fee , that you do not learn about until you check out your portfolio on the tv .
		0
		if you eat @ antojitos down the hill , although the food is delicious , you will wait a long time , they do not give a bread basket and any extras you order , like extra beans you will be charged .
		4
		try lolitas on rt . 3, make a left down the hill .
		0
		they have delicious inexpensive mexican cuisine .

		nice resort , pretty grounds , overall pretty good this was our first stop on our honeymoon and the resort was a perfect place to relax and unwind after the wedding .
		3
		we had a double queen room on the bottom floor and we did not face the ocean , but we did not really care .
		3
		our room had a refrigerator that looked old , but worked fine .
		3
		in theory , there was an extra charge for using the fridge , but they did not assess it on us .
		1
		the bathroom was very nice and spacious with a lot of counter space .
		3
		the front desk was very nice and helpful during check - in and check - out and we only ate in one of the on - site restaurants ( marabella ) , but our waitress was very nice and helpful .
		2
		the two separate swimming pools are great ; one for families and one for adults only .
		4
		our adults only pool was a great place to relax .
		3
		the beach is great looking and the water is just the right temperature without being too hot or too cold .
		0
		there are tons of sand dollars living on the bottom of the ocean right there , so that was pretty cool to see .
		2
		the resort has two workers assigned to get you an umbrella and chairs for sitting on the beach , which is really nice .
		2
		the tiki bar outside is just as expensive inside with a pina colada running about $11 each .
		3
		the beach does need cleaned a bit more often to remove the cigarette butts , but if everyone was diligent about removing their own trash there would not be a problem . two complaints about the resort are parking and computer access .
		1
		the self - park garage requires you to take a ticket when you park .
		2
		take the ticket with you because you have to stop at the valet 's desk out front of the hotel to have them validate it before you can leave and take your car out of the parking lot .
		2
		we ended up paying only $20 in parking despite being there for 4 days , so i do not know how that worked .
		0
		hauling the ticket around is a pain and they should really have someone working the exit booth of the garage .
		3
		the only other complaint was computer access .
		3
		the resort has four computers set up so that you can access the internet during your stay if you do not have your own laptop .
		1
		i loved the idea , but you had to pretty much glare at the teens , pre - teens , and kids that were camped out on the computers without parental supervision .
		4
		eventually , one would disengage from facebook and let you use the computer for 3 minutes .
		1
		where were the parents of these kids ? ?we did the rainforest and liked it except for how busy it was .
		2
		lots of people everywhere .
		3
		note to travelers : wear a bathing suit to the rainforest .
		0
		we apparently did not get that memo and did not realize you could hop in whatever water you want .
		1
		it also rained twice while we were hiking and a bathing suit would have been better than a shirt and shorts .
		0
		we also did old san juan , which was cool to see , but the parking was a nightmare .
		0
		we ate at richie 's cafe up the hill from the resort and found it to be overpriced for the food , but the view is nice and they do have some authentic puerto rican cuisine on the menu .

		very nice resort the best part about the rio mar was the staff .
		2
		they were very accomodating when we asked to switch rooms , and they helped us promptly with a smile .
		3
		all of the restarant staff were likewise very polite and were happy to make suggestions and engage in conversation . the rooms are very adequate , although a bit on the small side .
		3
		at night , the coqui frogs will either sing you to sleep or keep you awake .
		4
		if you are a light sleeper , it would be wise to be on a higher floor . the pool area is somewhat crowded if you do not secure a spot early .
		3
		they also have a quiet pool , which seemed to have just as many fun - loving kids as the larger pool . . . so it really was not any more peaceful . the beach is nice , but the water was not the turqoise we were hoping for .
		1
		it was not crowded and was a very short walk from the pool area . the hotel has an iguana pool and has several feedings scheduled each day .
		3
		my youngest daughter enjoyed hand feeding them with lettuce supplied by the hostess . the best part of the vacation was our short drive over to the el yunque rainforest .
		2
		we spent the morning hiking on paved , well marked trails and saw some incredible vistas . our trip into old san juan was forgettable .
		3
		it may have been better if we had arranged a guided tour , but we went on wednesday , which was apparently trash day , and had to step over piles of garbage bags as we walked through the streets . both of my children thoroughly enjoyed this vacation , and my wife and i did too .

		there was street noise , but this is ny . . . you are not going to find quiet ! the little things that will bring me back to this hotel again are the staff and service .

		an oasis just 50 paces from times square this was our first visit to new york from london and we could not have chosen a better hotel .
		4
		the staff were all knowledgeable , friendly and helpful and the room was clean and pleasant with all the facilities we could have wished for . although the hotel is only 50 paces from times square with all its noise and bustle , once inside , there is no noise to be heard .
		4
		being so close to times square and the subway meant that it was easy to get around either by walking or by subway . as it is a small hotel , we found that both staff and guests were very friendly and it was good to meet up with so many different people both at breakfast ( which was excellent ) , during the day and in the evening when cheese and wine were served .
		3
		tea , coffee , biscuits , pastries and fruit were available all day which was great as we found that sandwiches from delis were far too large !
		4
		we would thoroughly recommend this hotel both for its location and its ambiance and had a great stay .

		the best choice in ny !
		4
		we were overwhelmed by the choice when trying to pick a hotel in ny and eventually made our decision based on reviews on the web . we spent 6 nights at this small but lovely hotel and can only confirm all the good things we had read .
		4
		it has a perfect location just off times square and several of the city 's attractions can be reached on foot .
		4
		it is the personal touches that make this hotel so special - the wonderful , helpful staff , the great quality breakfast , the complimentary wine and cheese , free use of the internet etc .
		4
		although the rooms are a little pokey , they are clean and nicely furnished .
		4
		i thoroughly recommend it to any tourists visiting the city .

		fifth ave , broadway , empire state building , central park , grand central , ny public library , rockafeller centre , nbc were all easily accessible from this location . the inside of the hotel is lovely .
		1
		we stayed in the mini suite which was ideal , quite roomy with a good sized en - suite - all kept very clean .
		4
		the only downside , and this is not the hotels fault , was the noise at night .
		4

		the bathroom was spotless .

		3
		we found the hotel oustanding in every respect .
		4
		need to view this hotel as 'the total package '.
		3
		it is located right in the heart of times square , rooms and bathrooms are spotless and well furnished , decor in rooms and hallways is impressive and the piece de resistance is rick 's cafe on the second floor with access to 24 hour coffee , snacks etc and free wine and cheese every evening .
		4
		also free internet access in the cafe .
		2
		this was a great place to relax and meet other guests .
		4
		this is a boutique hotel so will not offer all the amenities of a larger chain but this is what made the hotel so far as we were concerned - smaller , friendly staff and place to relax and socialise outside of your room .
		3
		when we arrived one room was very noisy and we asked to be moved .
		4
		this was no problem and we were quickly located to another room on the other side of the hotel .

		- yes there was some noise from the street below in the early morning but we kept the window closed - it is new york after all and i do not think the hotel can be blamed for things like bin collection and police sirens .

		we actually got engaged while we were there and told the concierege on the night it happened as we were going out for dinner and he immediatly sent up a complimentary bottle of champage to our room .

		tranquill but in the middle of the action the casablanca is a great little hotel right in the middle of all the action just a few yards from times square . our room was at the rear and although we were so close to a busy spot you could not hear a thing at night , so we slept like babies . the breakfast is continental style and there is free tea and coffee all day long .
		4
		also of an evening 5pm til 7pm they offer free cheese and wine , which we did a couple of times and its a great start to an evening out . every member of the desk staff could not do enough for us .

		i would heartily recommend this hotel , you will not be disappointed . dave  bevmanchester , uk .

		fantastic base for new york stay !
		4
		just back this morning from our first trip to new york and 5 days in the casablanca . we 've had a really fantastic time and my feet are absolutely killing me . . . handy tip take very comfortable shoes and use the subway , the 'little ' walks soon add up and take their toll . the casablanca is a perfect base , literally just off times sq , subway just round the corner and within walking distance of most of the big attractions , chrysler building , grand central station and empire state building . really friendly staff who would happily do anything with a smile .
		4
		the free cheese and wine in the evening is a real social base for catching up with other visitors and their hot tips .
		4
		there 's also free internet access for booking tickets and checking in for flight back etc , if i was being really picky the bed was smaller than i expected in america but it stood up to any european city , was exceptionally clean , comfy bathrobes and even had complimentary dvd 's available for when the days walking the sights had taken their toll .

		( breakfast at tiffany 's has a whole different outlook when you 've just been there ! )tony 's
		4
		restaurant next door is amazing .

		it 's family style dining so you order a dish and it comes on a big platter and serves 2-3! fantastic atmosphere and really great food .
		3
		you can also order it in for room service .
		4
		i 've spent 33 years researching cheesecake and i can honestly say that their ny cheesecake is the best i 've ever tasted ! i 'd really recommend the casablanca and we 'll definitely stay here again next time . couple of other tips - if you 'd like to visit the statue of liberty monument inside you can only do that through prebooked tickets - i did it through the statue cruises website before i went over .
		3
		it also meant only queuing for the security check and not tickets too .
		2
		ellis island is great and the audio tour really helps . when it comes to the empire state building i had prebooked tickets but the queue was so big we decided to upgrade to the express pass .
		0
		it would have been cheaper to do this online but it was so worth doing i would recommend it !
		3
		the queue was outside and about 3 hours to get to top .
		4
		express pass meant we were there in about 5 minutes .
		3
		when you have so many other things to do it 's not great to spend it queuing . all in all a great city and i ca not wait to go back !

		3
		the location is perfect - 2 mins from times square .
		3
		the hotel staff were exceptional and always more than willing to oblige .
		4
		the longe called ricks cafe where refreshments and snacks are available 24/7 is a real bonus and the cheese and wine reception in the evenings is great as well as being very sociable . we met 2 ladies from belfast and enjoyed their company . the rooms are small but imaculate - i would suggest that when you arrive in the room the lights are left on because they are a little dark as there is no view to look at ! but this is not a problemit was nice to have breakfast in the hotel - not many hotels in new york provide breakfast in the price . overall a great hotel and one to be recommended

		having read all the reviews on trip advisor , we were really lookiing forward to our stay at this hotel so we were so disappointed when we arrived from the uk to find we were not expected !
		0
		apparently we were booked in for feb 2009 by mistake ( we 're told member of staff reponsible does not work there anymore ! ) . luckily the hotel was not fully booked but we did have to move rooms mid stay which was a bit of a nuisance - on the upside we did get to see 2 different rooms and we were offered champagne as an apology . despite that , i have nothing but good things to say about the hotel .
		4
		both rooms were spotlessly clean , very comfortable , quiet . the location ca not be faulted . all the staff were very friendly and especially helpful on our last day when it was snowing heavily and we could not get a cab to take us to the airport !
		4
		we made it with a minute to spare thanks to hector our driver who was organised by a member of staff on reception ( sorry , terrible memory for names ! )breakfast was a nice extra and although we did not partake of the cheese and wine , it was nice touch . we will definitely stay there again next time we travel to new york .

		hoorah for casablanca !
		4
		i recently enjoyed a three night stay at the casablanca , as a sort of mini school reunion with four friends .
		4
		we chose new york , as we were travelling from london and california and it was the nearest to a halfway point we could manage .
		4
		we chose the casablanca based on recommendations from tripadvisor and i would like to add my name to the list of fans . since our group was arriving at different times and sharing rooms , i made several calls to the hotel regarding our booking .
		4
		the staff were always friendly and welcoming , no matter what time of night i called , and i would always deal directly with whoever answered the phone , rather than being put on hold .
		0
		when we checked in , it had been noted that one of us would be celebrating a birthday during our stay , and we were offered a bottle of champagne to be sent to our room , which was much appreciated . the hotel is fabulously central , just by times square and you really feel when you step outside the door that you are right in the thick of things .
		4
		on stepping inside however , you have the sense of arriving at an oasis of calm . the room were beautifully decorated and more spacious than i expected for new york .
		1
		one of the best things about the hotel is rick 's bar , which is a lounge on the second floor for guests , open 24 hours .
		4
		we were served an excellent breakfast here and in the evening from 5 to 8pm , wine and cheese is available .
		4
		now that 's what we would call a very happy hour !
		4
		the rest of the time , coffee , ( a cappucino machine , no less ) and cookies were available .
		4
		it was a great place for my friends and i to relax and catch up and there was even a pianist on the friday evening . the staff were always friendly and helpful and really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and at home .
		3
		it really was a very personal service . on the morning we checked out , we did not actually have to leave new york till about 11pm that night .
		4
		the staff very kindly took care of our bags ( even letting us have access to them in the afternoon to put away shopping ! ) and invited us to make use of rick 's bar during the day if we needed a break .
		4
		i have since learned that many hotels charge a fee to hold your bags , so we were very grateful for this service . it was great to be able to walk to the theatre , to dinner and to many other attractions and it made new york feel much smaller than it had on previous visits . next time i stay at the casablanca , i would like to try to a room at the rear of the hotel , as there is some street noise .

		i know this is unavoidable in new york , but we were unlucky that the city had decided to dig up the road outside the hotel during our stay .

		everything else about our stay was quite perfect however , and i would heartily recommend this hotelmary

		from the moment you enter into the front door , you are greeted so pleasantly , the front desk is so very helpful , always helping with directions , reservations , any requests . . . .the breakfast and 24/7 refreshments in a beautifully decorated , and extremely clean cafe was such a plus . our train did not leave till 4:00, check out time was 12:00, they took our luggage , stored our luggage , and told us we could relax in the lounge till we had to leave .
		4
		i would very highly recommend this hotel , it is most certainly an oaisis in the heart of times square .

		my wife and i stayed at the casablanca hotel from 7/19-23 and we have to add our enthusiastic agreeent to all of the positive reviews on this site !

		the location in the heart of times square cannot be beat ; the decor is warm , exotic and inviting ; the comfort  amenities provided were above and beyond what we expected ; the kindness , courtesy  professionalism of the entire staff were superb .
		4
		given its location on times square , i have to admit that i was skeptical about the reviews that stated how quiet the hotel is .
		3
		however , it is totally accurate - once you cross the threshold of the lobby , you are in a quiet  more serene world totally opposite from the outside hustle  bustle of the city !
		4
		our queen bed room was cozy and comfortable ( loved the bathrobes  slippers ! ) with one of the most beautiful bathrooms we have every seen .

		we were also appreciative of the continental breakfasts  evening wine/cheese receptions in rick 's cafe - as well as the complimentary guest passes to a wonderful exercise club just a couple of blocks away .

		a gem in times square i was intrigued by a 48- room hotel in times square .

		having stayed in numerous small hotels in europe , i was prepared for smaller sized rooms . i was greeted at the front desk with my reservation information ready for initials and my luggage was whisked away by a bellman who explained everything in the room .
		3
		he encouraged me to join the wine , champagne and cheese reception in rick 's cafe . i enjoyed both the evening reception and the buffet breakfast in a room that was comfortable , open , yet private .
		4
		newspapers were in all corners and it was a generally relaxed atmosphere . i was surprise with how beautiful the appointments were in my room and by how quiet the room was .
		4
		i had stayed on the 30th floor of the marriott marquis and this 6th floor room was infinitely more quiet . i 'll be back to new york and am definitely happy that my company has added casablanca to the list of approved hotels .

		oasis of calm we stayed at this hotel on our first visit to new york from 18th to 23rd october 2006.
		4
		having booked a long time before our visit wewere a little apprehensive but need not have worried .
		4
		from the moment we got out of our taxi we were met with friendly smiling staff for whom nothing was too much trouble .
		1
		we arrived earlier than expected and were told that breakfast was still available whilst our room was made ready ( upgraded from queen to king by the hotel for the same rate ) .
		4
		our cases were whisked away and stored until we needed them .
		4
		our room was spotless and large , likewise the bathroom .
		4
		towels were changed daily , sometimes twice .
		2
		for a hotel so close to times square it was so quiet .
		4
		as soon as you stepped into the lobby the street noise disappeared .
		1
		free breakfast was plentiful with staff on hand to replenish everything .
		4
		the 24hr coffee machine waswonderful and my wife now wants one .
		4
		having been out for a very busy day what better than cheese , biscuits , wine or champagne at 5pm , again at no extra charge .

		a gem of a hotel .

		of all the bars in all the world you gotta walk into this one . . ! we have just returned from our first ever visit to the usa .
		4
		our trip involved a three week itinerary in a wide area of locations one of which involved the very necessary visit to new york city .
		4
		we did our homework at the planning stage and having read favourable reviews of the casablanca , we booked to stay for 5 nights . this is new york city , one of the great cities of the world and as such , hotel prices are not cheap .
		1
		the casablanc isnt cheap either but there are times when it really is worth investing in quality and a visit to nyc is such a time and the casablanca is such a place . the casablanca is conveniently and centrally situated in a street just off times square .
		1
		even so it is an oasis of peace in which to seek refuge from the mad , crazy bustle of nyc .
		4
		the staff are incredibly friendly , welcoming and accomodating .
		3
		the hotel sells itself as a themed boutique style hotel and it does it very well with good quality and stylish equipment and decor .
		0
		true the rooms are small by european standards but then most rooms in nyc are of similar dimensions unless you pay an absolute fortune . our room was well equipped , clean and comfortable .
		4
		breakfast is served in a nice comfortable residents lounge and is of good quality , well prepared with a good choice .
		1
		coffee etc are available all day and there is the included wine and cheese reception in the afternoon . we can recommend the casablanca as a great place to stay for your visit to nyc . joe  judith , manchester uk

		inspired me to write my first review have used tripadvisor for the past couple of years to choose hotels , but have never posted my own review until now .
		0
		just wanted to confirm that the hotel casablanca is the great hotel described by most posters , and i really ca not understand those who question the friendliness of the staff .
		2
		myself and my husband both independently commented on how good the staff were - they were particularly human and friendly , with a sense of humour which is often lacking .
		0
		doormen were also particularly helpful - noting our queries to pass onto the people on the desk if there was any queue at all - and our questions were always answered .
		4
		this is the 6th different hotel i 've stayed at in new york on seven visits , and the first time i would choose to go back to a hotel for any other reason than price - not that i particularly disliked previous hotels , but for value for money ( we paid $299 per night for our king sized bedroom ) , friendliness and amenities , this hotel would win hands down .
		4
		the previous poster who noted the hotel was not a 5* hotel - well it 's not , it 's a 3* hotel according to this website , but it 's the best 3* hotel i 've stayed in .
		3
		the times square location is ideal as nowhere in manhattan is too far away from midtown ( we requested a quiet room and it was very quiet for new york , let alone times square ) .
		3
		room size was average , but the decor was very nice , clean and modern with nice toiletries .
		3
		the dvd and complimentary dvd library was a nice touch , with a reasonable range of films to choose from , and the free internet access is always useful . the wine and cheese in the evenings was a fantastic touch - with at least 5 different types of cheese , quality biscuits , grapes and very drinkable wine , as was the day long fruit , coffee , biscuits , muffins etc .
		4
		it certainly drew guests back to sample what was on offer - yet there was always a seat left for us .
		3
		the pianist sounded great on friday night - sadly we were not able to stay to listen to him as we had show tickets .
		4
		complimentary breakfasts were great considering they were complimentary - including cereals , pastries , bagels , fruit , cream cheese , hard boiled eggs , yoghurts etc . and a selection of drinks .
		4
		you almost need not eat out at all with the quality and quantity of complimentary food and drink provided by the hotel ( not that i recommend that given the wealth of good restaurants in the vicinity ) .
		3
		the day we checked out we left our bags and on going back for them popped upstairs to check our flight details on the internet for the following day .
		4
		thought the receptionist may have a problem with that ( particularly as the internet was in the lounge with the free pastries and coffee ) , but nothing was said , nobody checked on us , and they were polite and courteous as usual .

		a little gem we picked this hotel for its proximity to the theatres as this was our first trip to new york and we were not sure how easy it was to get around .
		4
		what a gem !
		4
		so close to the bustle of times square and yet a million miles away when you walk through the doors .
		4
		we stayed on the fifth floor at the rear overlooking the central courtyard and i can honestly say you hear nothing other than the occasional siren ( it is new york after all ) .
		4
		the room was spacious and the bathroom well equiped with a good sized shower . the compimentary wines and cheese ( and popcorn ! ) in rick 's cafe each evening were a treat and nice to come back to after a day pounding the streets .
		4
		the breakfast buffet was an unexpected bonus with fresh fruit , bagels , croissants etc and real coffee facilities .
		4
		we never did get out for the must do american breakfast , it was just too easy to settle down in rick 's ! internet access was always available - and well used !

		we would not hesitate to stay here again , we had a fabulous week helped by excellent staff and great weather ! !

		loved it so much , we returned for another stay after our recent second stay at the casablanca , i can only say wow . our first stay was in march , 2005, and was great .
		4
		the desk staff was friendly and helpful , the generous breakfast buffet tasty and efficiently staffed , the complementary cocktail hour an excellent start to the evening .

		even though we arrived early , we were able to go directly to our room - - which was upgraded to a suite .

		the bed was comfortable , the bath well - appointed , everything was clean ( and my husband is fussy about cleanliness ) .

		with discounted parking ( $25 for overnight ) right next door , there seemed to be little more we could want .

		while we did not get an upgraded room , the deluxe king we 'd reserved was ready for us when we arrived at 1pm .
		1
		there was no view ( windows opened onto an air shaft ) , but as we were staying only overnight and were not in the room much , that was not a problem .

		i had booked a king room back in april for our stay in december however they had to give it to another customer due to an over - booking .

		at this point usually i 'm sure a battle between the receptionist/manager and myself would normally have ensued however the casablanca offered me free wine , a discount from our stay and told me that we could have the king room the following day - without me having to say a word .

		in the morning a light breakfast ( boiled eggs , cerials , fruit , rolls , breads and so forth ) was available in ric 's . we have two dining recommendations : the 2nd avenue deli (2nd ave @ 10th st , a cab ride from the hotel ) was just great for lunch ; have a pastrami sandwich , one was plenty for my wife and me to share , and if you like ales , try layla which is brewed in israel .
		4
		for dinner , you should consider restaurant row which is on west 46th street between 7th and 9th avenues , a short walk from the hotel .
		4
		there are several restaurants on both sides of the street and each has a menu out front for you to look at .
		4
		we had maine lobster dinners at terry 's ( $17.95 each and worth it ) ; next night we ate at a french restaurant just down from terry 's which was also very good and reasonably priced .

		after dinner we went to the very friendly st . andrews pub which is on the other side of the block from the hotel on 44th street . we will definitely consider the hotel casablanca on our next trip to the big apple and we do not hesitate to recommend it to others !

		casablanca hotel - a haven in times square we stayed a week (19/9 - 26/9) at the casablanca on our first visit to new york .
		4
		as first time visitors we found this to be an ideal position just steps away from the always busy times square .
		4
		despite the proximity to the hustle and bustle , the hotel itself was a haven of tranquility and we did not hear any noise from our room at night . the all day complimentary beverages and cakes in rick 's cafe were most welcome when popping back to the hotel to drop off shopping or for a break between visiting attractions .
		4
		the central position and nearby times square subway station meant that it was easy to get back to from anywhere in manhattan for break . the hotel also provides complimentary wine  cheese etc each weeknight which was also very welcome and was a pre theatre must .
		4
		we had prebooked chicago  spamalot before arriving and both were in easy walking distance from the casablanca . the service was excellent from all the staff who would do everything they could to help and assist when asked . we would recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again if we are fortunate enough to return to new york .

		the best hotel in new york i booked a room at the casablanca for a 3 day stay in august 2005.
		3
		i must admit that i was slightly apprehensive about staying there due to some recent reviews and , in fact , almost changed my reservation several times .
		4
		however , i eventually decided to stick with my original reservation and i am so glad that i did . the casablanca is a truly wonderful hotel .
		4
		an absolute oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of time square .

		it was almost as if i entered another era as soon as i stepped foot through the door .
		4
		i was upgraded to a queen room without asking and i found the room to be delightful .
		4
		yes , it was fairly small , but this was not a problem at all .
		4
		there was plenty of room for a queen sized bed , a cupboard with minibar , large tv and vcr , and a small table with 2 chairs .
		4
		there was a marble ensuite bathroom which was lovely and clean , and the toiletries all smelled of spiced oranges .
		2
		i am particularly picky about where i stay and about cleanliness , and i could not fault a single thing at the casablanca hotel .
		4
		if anyone complains about the size of the rooms then they are obviously spending way too much time within the room .

		there is so much to see and do in nyc that i was rarely at the hotel . there is a buffet breakfast in the 2nd floor lounge area , tea , coffee , cakes and biscuits throughout the day , and a wine , champagne and cheese buffet in the evening .
		4
		this is a wonderful , and very useful , extra which most other hotels would charge for . the staff are extremely helpful and friendly , including the porter , the russian ( ? ) girl who helps with the food and the front desk staff , igor and peter ( ? ) .

		i 'm not sure if i got the names right , but they were all fantastic . the hotel decor is not , as previously suggested , tired and dated but is in fact somewhat reminiscient of old - world morocco and has a delightful atmosphere .

		the casablana has a more individual charm and alot more personality than other ny hotels . the location is fantastic , being right in the centre of time square , about 4 doors away from the subway and from a starbucks , and the theatres being approximately a 2 minute walk from the hotel .

		excellent customer service !
		4
		we stayed at the chancellor from jun14-17 and absolutely loved it .
		4
		the location was great , right beside union square and near all the shops .
		4
		ton 's of restaurants in the area within walking distance , sushi , pizza , chinese , all american , whatever you are in the mood for .
		4
		it was easy to get to , we took the bart from the airport , took about 25minutes to get to our stop , just followed the directions , cost was $5.35each one way , walk to the hotel from the bart stop was slightly up hill along powell , cable car line , approx 4 blocks or so , took us maybe 10mins .
		3
		lovely reception area , check - in could not have been quicker , staff at front desk were very friendly and welcoming .
		4
		they gave us a package at check - in giving us a discount for the dining area as well as 2 for 1 drinks at the hotel bar .
		3
		we also received a coupon for the 11% discount at macy 's given to foreign passport holders .
		4
		now to the room .
		4
		i had done my homework and was expecting a smaller size room based on everything i 'd read and yes the room is smaller than some , however it is not the smallest room i 've ever stayed in and i have travelled a lot .
		4
		the room was efficiently layed out , with nothing in the way of the other and spotlessly clean .

		i loved the rubber duck in the bathroom and the bath salts that soothed my aching blistered feet .

		there was more than enough room for two girls who planned on shopping and bringing takeout back to the room .
		4
		the closet was huge , walkin with a safe in the back , iron , ironing board and an umbrella , just in case , i love it !
		4
		there was a jar of candy on one of the tables , mint , butterscotch , cinnamon , jolly rancher , nice touch , we had several .
		2
		room service was available , not particularily expensive , however we did not order anything becase coffee was always available and freshly baked cookies as well as apples .
		0
		we would grab a coffee and cookie in the morning as well as a complimentary newspaper .
		1
		as mentioned in previous reviews , there is no air conditioning , but the windows in the bathroom and the room open , allowing for air to circulate and there is a fan overhead if you need it , but i do not think you will , average temp during summer is in the mid 70's and it cools down at night .
		4
		we did not use the fan .
		4
		we had two single beds and covering up with the lightweight duvet was more than enough to keep us warm or cool at the same time .
		4
		the bed was extremly comfortable .

		there is a tour desk in the lobby .
		4
		they will make arrangements for any tour you like , pick up from the front lobby .

		we took a day tour of the city , highly recommend it , it took us to all the spots you must see , first time in sfo .

		if you do not want to book a tour , from this location you are within blocks of china town , taking you maybe 10-15mins to get there .

		we walked from the wharf back to the hotel , took us 45 minutes , most of it uphill .
		4
		no problem .

		now to the part that made the biggest impression on us , the hotel staff .

		it was not just the staff at the front desk that were friendly but everyone that worked there said hello to us and smiled .

		once we were getting into an elevator and the bellman who was already in the elevator got out to allow us to use the elevator first .
		2
		he insisted , even though we told him we 'd wait .
		1
		the employee 's all seemed happy to be there and ready to work , no private converstaions going on that you fear interrupting or conversations that continue while you wait for someone to notice you are waiting to ask a question and that means a lot to me .
		3
		i hate feeling like someone is doing me a favour by answering a question .

		chancellor is a great find - but not for everyone just returned from three nights at the chancellor and have mostly very positive things to say about the chancellor - we would definitely stay there again when returning to san francisco ( which is a wondeful city - everyone should visit ) .
		4
		the location is perfect - a few of blocks from the cable - car turnaround , across the street from union square , within walking distance of excellent restaurants and bars . . .
		4
		i could go on , but suffice it to say that for travellers and tourists , i strongly recommend it .
		4
		( a quick hint : if you 're looking for great breakfasts , go a few blocks south to cafe bellini , pick up a sandwich or danish , and enjoy some outdoor dining on the steps in union square . )although our interaction with hotel staff was relatively limited , i must give special mentiont to rory , who greeted us on arrival late friday night : in the midst of a very trying set of circumstances ( he was alone at the front desk , confronting an ever - increasing line of people waiting to be checked in , a pair of guests whose door - keys refused to work , and someone who kept calling on the phone to ask for driving directions ) , he maintained his composure and was polite and helpful throughout . as many good things as i have to say about the hotel , it is not for everyone .
		3
		i greatly enjoyed the jar of complimentary candy in our room and the free popcorn in the lobby , but some people might see these as gilding the lily .
		3
		although i 've seen the term boutique applied to the chancellor , i do not think that 's entirely accurate - to me , the term implies a hotel which has been recently renovated to offer the latest in design elements and luxury amenities .
		0
		that 's not the chancellor .
		3
		you wo not be finding a sleek bar in the lobby , or flat - screen tvs in your room - what you 're getting is an older building that could use some renovating , but which with apparent attention and effort has been well - maintained and is certainly punching above its weight .
		1
		as an example , the beds are very comfortable , but the lobby is dated ( if still quite nice ) .
		3
		it 's an excellent value , it 's a great location , i would strongly recommend it - but if you 're looking for a cookie - cutter chain environment , or more emphasis on fancy bottles of shampoo and pricey designer bottled water , this is not for you .
		2
		the chancellor offers accommodations with some quirks ( both good and bad ) and a bit of personality - precisely what some are looking for in a lodging experience , but not exactly what caters to everyone .

		great city to visit first stop on our whistle stop tour of the usa . we arrived at the hotel late and not in the best of moods after a long flight from the uk and with all our luggage missing .
		3
		the reception staff were very helpful and offered to look after our luggage during the night , should it arrive , and it did . we had a room at the front of the hotel and if offered great views of the street and cable cars , but the downside was the back ground noise for most of the night .
		0
		it was not a difficult discussion to request a room change , because we had not unpacked .
		4
		the room transfer was carried out while we were enjoying the sights of san francisco . the hotel is in great location for exploring the city , on the main cable car line for different points on the water front , not to mention the underground , and bus service , and of course the shops . like all hotels in the usa you have no drink making facilities in the room , but next to the bar they seam to have coffee and tea on tap all day , not to mention the cookies in the morning , and fresh pop corn most evenings . in the reception they have information desk so can book all your trips , not to mention the lorries shuttle for the return trip to the airport . we found the hotel very clean and comfortable and would recommend it to everybody . san francisco is great city to visit , it felt very clean and most of all very safe .

		excellent boutique hotel !
		3
		having previously read the reviews on tripadvisor , i felt quite confident on booking this hotel , and i was not disappointed .
		1
		we arrived following a long flight , and a sharp introduction to driving in san francisco ( do not ! ) - we had a simple and very friendly check - in and were straight up to our rooms ( which as we had requested were close together ) .the location is fantastic . . a short walk to the main shopping area , and easy ( right outside the hotel ) cable car connections towards fishermans wharf . the rooms were recently refurbished , and nicely decorated .
		4
		excellent walk - in closet , the bathroom was a little small - but thats hardly a problem !
		4
		i thought it was great that you could plug your mp3 player into the radio , so that you could listen to your own music .
		3
		and the nice touch of a pot of sweets was lovely ! coffee/tea were provided in the hotel lobby free - of - charge so you could just help yourself whenever you fancied one - again a nice touch . off - site parking is available on sutter street ( quicker to walk to than drive to ! ) but none - the - less ideally placed .
		3
		they also do valet parking there if thats your preference . the only downside really was that there was no ac , and the rooms can get a little warm .
		4
		yes , you can open the window , but it does get quite noisy with the cable cars . . . however after the first night i found i could get used the cable car bells , however the emergency services are not quite so quiet ! ! ! loved the little bar in the hotel . . only thing it closed at 9.30pm every night we were there . . . thats pretty early .
		4
		i believe friday  saturday nights it is open later .

		drink selection is pretty good . overall , we had a great stay , and we would certainly return to the chancellor if we find ourselves back in san francisco .

		honestly - -this is a great hotel i chose this hotel as for my budget it was the top rated hotel - no 5, and every positive report seen was true . we had an e - mail the day before we travelled to confirm room would be ready , so no nasty shocks upon arrival , cannot find booking and full . - - -great
		4
		pr that e - mail . the staff at reception upon arrival were friendly and helpful and our room 1400( i reqested a high room when booking in january ) , was clean and airy .
		4
		the furniture was clean and the beds were very comfortable with good mattresses and most important of all the bed linen was pristine whitethe bathroom was very clean and well supplied with a few extras like cotton balls and buds and tissues and of course the yellow duck . in the room too we had a small room off , for cases , hanging spaces , an ironing board , umbrella and safe . the tv was good with stacks of channelsand we also had a modern alarm clock into which you could plug your mp player . down stairs you have a lobby , bar and resturant with free tea or coffee and cookies from mid afternoon till evening time . the staff were very friendly ( especially mao in the resturant - a little gem ) and all were very proffesional in they 're jobs . the location of the hotel is a plus point too , being only 250 yards from bart station , overlooking union square with all the best shops you could wish for nearby and a cable car stop outside the hotel .
		3
		this hotel has been set up and run to care for its clients and it does so in a very efficient manner , i will , upon my return to sf hopefully in not too distant future , return to this hotel , not bothering to look elsewhere .
		1
		i can say honestly , hand on heart this establishment is a credit to the city and i would without question recommend it to anyone . read reports in tripadvisor about other hotels - -rip offs , dodgy areas , paperthin walls and torn dirty bed linen - - - you will get nothing like that here - - - what they promise in the brochures is exactly what you get and delivered in a friendly proffesional manner .

		highlight of our honeymoon !
		3
		we stayed at the chancellor for 3 nights last week at the beginning of our honeymoon .
		4
		we booked at this property because of the excellent reviews on this site and also because we loved wes tyler 's smart and funny management responses .
		3
		it was absolutely the right choice . we arrived at the hotel around noon , and the checkin was smooth - -despite our early arrival , our room was ready within 15 minutes .
		3
		the room was lovely , and there was a bottle of champagne , glasses with the chancellor logo , and a lovely picture frame waiting for us .

		the front desk and concierge staff were friendly and gave excellent directions to all the places we wanted to go .

		the coffee and cookies in the lobby were a homey touch , and the coffee was so good i never felt the need to go in search of peet 's !

		we used the pillow menu ( the memory foam pillows are amazing ) , and we asked the first day for a refrigerator , which was delivered and cold by the time we returned from lunch in chinatown .

		a truly great bargain this is my second stay at this hotel , though this time my wife joined me , so there were two in our room .
		4
		i have only good things to say about the chancellor .
		4
		this is a hotel that speaks of the caring attitude from top to bottom : ownership , management , employees .

		the room was quiet , clean , newly decorated and the bed was very comfortable .

		breakfast was reasonably priced and tasty ; service was cheerful and professional .

		in fact , all of the staff was courteous , knowledgable and helpful ( e . g . , they take it as a challenge to get you online via their wifi system , which i am finding is difficult to do with microsoft 's vista software , but they persisted in helping me - - and succeeded , more than i can say about the other , much more expensive , hotel where we stayed on this trip ) .
		4
		in a city like san francisco , what more does one really need ?
		4
		in fact , many of the more expensive hotels we have been to could learn a lot by observing the efforts that everyone associated with the chancellor makes to help you enjoy your trip .

		by the way , if you wish to have a quiet and peaceful room ( though without a view ) , request one in the back .

		0
		right on union square with a cable car stop right out the front door , with very easy access to public transportation ( we bought a 3 day muni pass for $18 dollars , a great deal because pt in this city is very convenient ) , and loads of shopping nearby .

		cost : i wanted to go on the cheaper side for hotel cost , since i had just spent a bunch on baseball tickets , so you really cant beat the price at the chancellor .
		4
		i did a ton of research on tripadvisor and other hotel websites , and i knew that this was the place to stay .
		4
		i got a great rate of around $100 per night , and i had origianlly only booked one night at first .
		4
		after arriving at the hotel we realized that we had found a true gem and we immediately called the front desk to see if they could accomodate us for another night .
		4
		the front desk was more than helpful in extending our stay and also made sure we would not have to move our stuff into another room the next day .
		3
		simply flawless and friendly service .
		4
		room : i requested a room that was on a higher floor , newly renovated and facing union square .
		4
		when we checked in we got a corner room on the ninth floor overlooking union square .
		0
		bed was very comfortable , bathroom was small but very functional .
		3
		this is an older building so it has it 's quirks and imperfections , but that all adds to the charm . . . so just keep that in mind .
		4
		from reading past reviews , it seems that they are very good at accomodating every guest 's requests . . . but i 'm sure that there will be times when people 's requests ca not be met , but thats just how it goes .
		3
		this hotel really goes out of its way to make their guests happy , so no one should let a little thing like tat ruin their stay .
		4
		service : again , the service here is fantastic .
		3
		the woman at the front desk was so nice and helpful , and make checking in a total breeze ( we even arrived several hours before normal check in time , but this did not seem to be a problem in our case ) .
		2
		the bartender was also quite friendly and mixed some good drinks .
		4
		overall , you get great value for the money you pay .
		0
		in a city like sf you can expect to pay tons of money at any hotel , so paying the rate you pay at the chancellor , its almost like robbery !
		2

		superb amazing hotel in a great location . this hotel should be 4 or 5 stars for the service and the quality of the room , and proves how flawed the whole star system can be as i have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels which have been much worse than this one . firstly the location is second to none .
		2
		you are staying right on union square in prime central location .
		4
		you are staying right next to all the most expensive hotels , and the most expensive shops and restaurants . to get there from the airport i would advise taking one of the shuttle buses which will cost only $14 plus tip , much cheaper than a taxi . the service throughout the hotel was excellent .
		2
		the room was a good size , and it was located in a quiet area as i requested , although i thought the whole hotel was quiet . the hotel has wi - fi throughout , and if you do not have a computer you can check your emails on the computer in the lobby for free !
		4
		the room had a nice size bathroom , which a good shower/bath .
		3
		there is a fan in the room , which i preferred compared to the air - conditioning systems found in most hotels which always give me a sore throat . there is also a television and a clock which can play your mp3 player through its speakers . as for san francisco it is very nice .
		4
		would definitely advise booking alcatraz as soon as you get there as it is always booked up during peak season for at least a day , so if you are only staying a couple of days book it before you go there , and if you are staying a week or so , then do it as soon as you get there . the tour bus , located in fishman 's wharf is a good way of seeing the city ( and is close to the place for buying alcatraz tickets ) so i would advise seeing fisherman 's wharf , buying your alcatraz tickets and doing some of the tours on the first day so that you have a good orientation on the city . enjoy ,

		great location , funky room , good price having spent ages researching hotels and b and b 's in san fran , i ended up with the chancellor based on trip advisor ratings and the candid photo 's - these were ten times better than the home page pictures on the current hotel owned website which really put me off initially - update your site guys !
		4
		you need to do the rooms justice !
		4
		from the site i thought the more basic rooms would look like the homepage pics but they do not which is a good thing ! could not really fault our stay - loved the room - must have been done up recently ( again , does your website make this clear chancellor hotel ? ) in a very funky but restrained way .

		felt like a retro , botique style and not stiff , prim or chintzy like so many overpriced supposedly up market places .
		3
		bed was fab - good mattress , choice of pillows .
		3
		we overlooked union square but despite that , not too noisy (12th floor ) bathroom could be a little too 'retro ' for some people - think the fittings are the same as before renovation and looked a little old but spotlessly clean so who cares ?
		1
		if you are fussy about your bathroom this could be an issue but all we want is enough space and a decent shower and for it to be clean to it ticked all our boxes there .

		thanks chancellor ! location is very convenient .

		we were not that keen on union sqaure area itself but if you want to shop - this is the place to be .
		0
		best things going for location are the cable car right outside to take you to more interesting areas such as north beach , russian hill etc . unless you are taking a boat trip , advise staying well clear of fisherman 's wharf ( although sea lions are great fun ! ) as its tacky , packed and does not do san fran justice - much better to hang out in funky neighbourhoods or go to golden gate state park .
		4
		ferry to sansaulito highly recommended - pretty little town with great eating options over the bay .

		china town , city lights bookstore , north beach cafes and bars all an easy walk away - these were our favourite places to hang out and wander and chancellor was the perfect place to come back and chill after walking around all day .

		the hotel also offers nice extras like coffee and cookies in the lobby , free newspapers , free wi - fi access , and complimentary access to a health club a block away .
		4
		the tour desk in the lobby is also very helpful .
		4
		the only issue to keep in mind is that the hotel does not have air conditioning and keeping windows open at night could be a problem for light sleepers .
		3
		we ended up closing our window overnight to cut down on the noise from the traffic below ( the cable car goes right by the hotel ) .

		the chancellor provided a magical start to our vacation !
		4
		after reading reviews on this site , we thankfully booked a room at the chancellor through roomrate . com .
		4
		by the positive interaction i had had with wes tyler , who is the hotel 's general manager , and his staff prior to our vacation , i was already certain we were going to have a wonderful stay at the hotel .
		3
		we rode bart from sfo to the powell st . station .
		3
		we had a bit of an uphill walk on very crowded sidewalks to get to the hotel but it wasn?? too bad . upon check in we were delighted to hear that we had been upgraded to a romance suite .
		4
		this was a wonderful start to an amazing vacation .
		4
		the lobby of the chancellor is very lovely .
		0
		be sure to check out the elaborate crown moldings .
		3
		the girl at check in was very welcoming and told us our room would be ready shortly .
		4
		the delicious cookies i had read about were awaiting us in the lobby so i used our extra time to try one out - yummy !
		4
		we also bought our muni passes right there in the lobby .
		4
		soon our room was ready and we rode up the elevator to room 1502.
		4
		i want to add here that contrary to some of the posts i had read , although our room was on the 15th floor , we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator .
		4
		we were pleasantly surprised again by the chancellor with a wonderful collection of gifts including a lovely wooden picture frame , chocolates , champagne , glasses and a thoughtful card congratulating us on our 20th anniversary ( thanks wes ! ) .
		4
		we were so touched .
		4
		the suite was two adjoining rooms that seemed to have been two identical regular rooms at some point .
		4
		one had a sofa bed , two chairs , a desk , tv , and a full bath .
		0
		the other had a queen size bed , armoire , a 2nd tv , side tables and another full bath !
		1
		upon entering the room with the bed , we felt as if we had tiptoed into the twilight zone .
		2
		it was so bizarre ; the bed had our same croscill bedding that we have at home !
		3
		what are the chances ?
		1
		besides this , the print behind the bed is the exact one that i have in my living room here at home .
		0
		the armoire was also strikingly similar to ours .
		3
		i guess wes and staff really wanted to make us feel at home but i must say it was a little freaky !
		4
		it is an old hotel with lots of character .
		3
		i loved the enormous arched windows in both rooms as well as the crown moldings and walk in closet .
		4
		there were also hard candies and magazines provided in the room which was a nice touch .
		3
		both bathrooms had a slight step up to them as well as very deep bathtubs .
		4
		although the tubs had handrails , i could see where the bathrooms could be very difficult for anyone with mobility impairments .
		4
		the bathroom amenities included swabs , cotton balls , soaps , shampoo/conditioner ( bring your own if like me , you don?? like the mix ) , lotion , bath salts and an adorable rubber ducky ( the ducky can go home with you , i asked ! ) .
		4
		the hotel also offered free wireless service in the room which my husband was very happy about .
		1
		there was also free internet use in the lobby .
		3
		in addition to the cookies , there were apples , coffee and fresh hot popcorn provided each day .
		4
		there was also an extensive pillow menu that you could choose from with magnetic , snore stopping , bath and a variety of other pillows .
		3
		we found the ones on the bed so comfortable that we did not feel a need to try any others .
		4
		the bed was also quite comfortable .
		3
		between the armoire , nightstand tables and the deep closet , we had more than enough room to store our belongings .
		4
		there was also a safe in the room and a radio with an mp3 hook up .
		4
		in the bathroom , there was a spa item menu that you could rent items from .
		3
		everything had to be returned by 12:00 the next day .
		4
		there was a foot massager , bubble pad , a whirlpool machine and a variety of other items .
		3
		i rented the whirlpool machine for my aching legs but it did not seem to work very well , maybe because the tub is so deep .
		2
		i let the girt at the desk know this and although i did not ask for it to be done , i noticed i was not charged for it when i checked out . as we entered through the door of our room after exploring the city the first day , there was a strange intermittent blinking red light greeting us .
		3
		could it be that we had truly entered the twilight zone ?
		1
		as it turns out , there is a very large blinking neon sign for harry denton?? starlight room at the sir francis drake right outside our room !

		we pulled the curtains shut which obliterated all but a slight twinkling rosy glow and fell asleep to the ding of the cable cars and the music of the night .
		1
		we did not find the light or the outside noise bothersome .
		4
		we did have the window closed every night but the ceiling fan provided sufficient cooling .
		2
		in case you do not already know , there is no air conditioning in the hotel !
		4
		the trolley does stop right outside the hotel , but during our summer stay it was very busy unless it was early in the morning .

		perfect hotel to start our honeymoon we had the pleasure of starting our honeymoon at the chancellor hotel as part of our three centre west coast us visit to san francisco , los angeles and las vegas .
		4
		i chose the hotel as it was recommended by trailfinders who said their guests loved it , and despite extensive research on the net and tripadvisor i could not see another hotel i would prefer . we arrived at the hotel at 1.30 am after a nightmare 24 hour , 3 flight due to plane delays , journey from the uk (7 hours late ) .
		4
		after taking a minibus from the airport we checked in and were warmly welcomed , no queue due to lateness of the hour .
		4
		i had emailed the manager in advance and he had allocated us a high floor (14th ) room with a view of union square as requested .
		4
		a bottle of wine on ice and a lovely giftwrapped photograph frame were waiting for us due to this being our honeymoon .
		2
		i must be in the minority as i did not think our standard room was small at all , average and above average compared to many uk hotel rooms ( it was half as big again as the room we spent our wedding night in , in scotland , although i appreciate many us hotels have larger rooms ) and , given the massive walk - in cupboard with two luggage holders for storing our suitcases and hand luggage , i found the room spacious and not cramped at all .

		i also chose from the pillow menu the next day .
		3
		i knew there was no air conditioning as it is listed against all the information you read about this hotel , e . g brochures , tripadvisor , net info and hotel website so it 's really not a surprise .
		3
		we found the ceiling fan to be sufficent in october .
		3
		we never had to wait long for a lift/elevator and i never noticed any shabbiness in the bedroom or public areas which other guests have remarked upon ( and our visit was some time ago before renovations ) .

		maybe i am lax in choosing not to inspect every surface and drapery looking for minor flaws but i was on holiday and it all seemed ok to me . the location is spot on , right next to union square and 2 cable car routes .

		3
		an ex - inmate darwin coon was signing copies of his book on the day we visited alcatraz and answering questions - an unexpected bonus . the hotel does a nice breakfast and we used our 10% discount coupon given at check in for this .
		3
		we also had to visit sears fine foods next door given the high recommendations it receives but i found little difference between the two .

		we also had a good value breakfast at lefty o 'doul 's two blocks away and enjoyed visiting this bar at night too .
		4
		met some very interesting people !

		alicia at the bar at the chancellor was attentive and my husband had a few drinks here through our visit whilst waiting for me to get ready oh and to watch the sports on tv .
		2
		various complimentary foodstuffs and tea/coffee are available in the lobby although we never took advantage of these due to eating so well .
		3
		location wise we much preferred the city centre location as compared to fisherman 's wharf ( an easy cable car ride away ) , plus you can walk lots of places , chinatown is not far , and we used the buses , cable cars and streetcars to go further afield .
		4
		i had added san francisco to our trip after deciding against hawaii and it went from being our third choice city to first place .

		stellar service at the chancellor when planning my trip to san francisco , i researched hotels for months .
		4
		i chose the chancellor because of location , price , and most importantly , the rave reviews on trip advisor .
		4
		not only was i not disappointed , i was totally blown away by the high level of service i received from the entire staff . this was my first time traveling a long distance alone with my 15- year - old daughter ( we 're from the east coast ) , and i was pretty anxious about the trip .
		4
		my daughter has type 1 diabetes and is insulin - dependent .
		1
		she is also a typical teenager .
		3
		having read about the small rooms , i was somewhat concerned that we would drive each other crazy .
		2
		i requested a quiet room on an upper floor and a refrigerator for my daughter 's insulin .
		2
		we were given a corner room on the 14th floor at the back of the hotel .

		as others have mentioned , the closet is very large .

		we had room for all of our stuff , and knowing how changeable the sf weather can be , we brought enough clothes for a month - long stay !

		the room was extremely quiet with the windows closed .
		4
		however , our location was perfect for leaving them open and enjoying the sounds of the city without being overwhelmed by the noise .

		i ca not speak about thin walls because the room beside us was empty during our entire five - night stay . the central location is excellent .
		4
		we went all over the city and only used public transportation ( get a muni pass ! ) and foot power .
		2
		exploring sf this way really enhanced our experience . i cannot speak highly enough about the staff .
		3
		one incident will stand out for me forever .

		the refrigerator in our room froze several cartridges of two types of insulin , and they could no longer be used .

		my health insurance company refused to allow me to use a co - pay when replacing the insulin .

		the total out - of - pocket cost was over $350!

		when i spoke to hotel staff , they immediately offered to buy the insulin for me .

		while we waited , he was very kind and reassuring .
		2
		he told me over and over that i should not worry about anything and should just enjoy my trip .

		i am a single mom on a very tight budget .

		this meant the world to me .

		absolutely loved the chancellor !
		4
		my family stayed in a suite at the chancellor june 5-9th and had an absolutely wonderful time .
		3
		when we go to san francisco , the chancellor is always our first choice because the staff and management go so far above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and memorable .
		4
		the staff are extremely nice and helpful , the hotel has lots of character and charm , really comfy beds , an extensive pillow menu , fantastic cookies anytime you want them ( the white chocolate macadamia are to die for ! ) , complimentary rubber duckies for the tub ( one of those old fashioned deep tubs that is perfect for a long soak after walking in san francisco all day ) , the cable car stops almost at the door and the hotel has a union square location that absolutely ca not be beat !
		4
		i never would have believed that we could afford a hotel in san francisco that is this wonderful - i 'm ready to start planning our next trip !

		the perfect choice just returned from usa where the chancellor was my first stop .
		4
		i booked the hotel based on reviews on this website and my own research .
		1
		have stayed in many different types of hotels around the world , so knew what european boutique was . was given a room on 13th floor at the back of hotel when i checked in ( had made no special request ) .
		4
		was exactly as i expected and was not disappointed .
		4
		yes bathroom was small but you do not spend your holiday in the bathroom .
		4
		loved the baseball rubber ducky and the jars of sweets .
		2
		all staff i dealt with were very helpful and accomodating .
		3
		the coffee and biscuits a welcome treat after a long day .
		4
		the free pc/internet access at the main desk was an added and very welcome bonus for an international traveller . location is excellent .
		3
		if you stay in sf for a few days , check out the muni pass .
		4
		saved lots of money using it on cable cars and street cars . had a great stay in sf and the chancellor was the cherry on top .

		the chancellor is an excellent value - -ca not be beat  we stayed at the chancellor last week for four nights .
		4
		the hotel was everything i expected it to be .
		4
		we were fortunate enough to get a model room on the 10th floor .
		4
		yes , the rooms are small , but this room was very cozy , with a big walk - in closet and a great bathtub .
		4
		the bed was to die for .
		0
		i 've had a two - level spinal fusion so a comfortable bed is a crucial thing for me .
		4
		this bed was the best hotel bed i 've ever slept in , even considering high end hotels .
		1
		it was soft , but not too squishy .
		2
		nice linens too .
		4
		again , keep in mind this was a model room .
		1
		room 1000 to be exact .
		4
		great staff , good breakfast , nice little bar .
		0
		great rate of $109 per night .
		3
		we did not hear a thing thru the walls in our room .
		4
		and yes , you can hear the street noise , but we enjoyed the ambient noise of the clang clang clang goes the trolley , ring ring ring goes the bell .
		2
		after all , you wo not hear that noise in any other city in the world .

		wes tyler the general manager was a pleasure to deal with .

		enjoying the chancellor as i write this i am staying at the hotel right now and i must say everything is right on as far as the reviews .
		3
		the location ca not be beat and so far the staff has been very nice .
		3
		i told them it was my anniversary and in my room waiting for us was a nice bottle of wine with a note congratulating us on our anniversary .
		4
		yes the rooms are small but it adds a certain charm you do not get at your typical cookie cutter hotels .
		4
		for those of you looking to stay at a nice clean hotel at a fair price in an incredible location , then the chancellor is the perfect choice .

		thouroughly enjoyed our stay we stayed 5 days at the chancellor after arriving at the oakland airport at 11:00pm at night .
		2
		due to the late arrival and that we were travelling with an 18month old , we took a taxi straight to the hotel , which was probably the best option at that time .
		4
		the taxi did not have a car seat and we did not travel with one , but it is up to the parent to choose to travel as such on vehicles like buses/trolleys/taxis .
		4
		the taxi was a small suv style and the driver was conscientious .
		2
		the hotel staff was always professional and helpful .
		4
		they were able to accomodate a small fridge for our son 's food/milk even at the late hour of arrival (12:30am ) .
		4
		we only ate at the hotel restaurant one morning but the food was good and the staff was very nice .
		4
		susan at the tour desk was always helpful with info and booked a muir woods/sausolito tour for us along with a rental car reservation for later in the week .
		3
		the hotel location was excellent with the trolley being right outside .
		3
		the rental car facility was about 3 blocks away .
		4
		they picked us up at the hotel , but we returned from napa valley late , so i parked it in the garage above the rental facilty and walked back over in the morning to return the car .
		4
		we enjoyed san francisco very much .
		2
		i recommend if you do the muir/sausolito tour and want to stay longer in sausolito , just stay and take the ferry back to san fran .
		3
		in addition , we toured napa and sonoma and afterward drove straight west and came down the coast .
		3
		this added a few hours to our return time , but if your not prone to car sickness it is definitely worth it .
		4
		on our last day , we had a midnight flight out , so we left our luggage with the front desk for our last day of sightseeing .
		4
		on our return to the hotel , we decided to take the bart to oakland airport even with our little one and 4 pieces of luggage .
		2
		matt at the front desk took the extra time to help us with our luggage to the station , which was a huge help , and we had a nice inexpensive trip to the airport on the bart and air bart . we would definitely stay at the chancellor again .

		enjoyed our stay on a college visit to the bay area we stayed at the chancellor for an evening after reading the reviews on tripadvisor .
		4
		the reviews had been overwhelmingly favorable , and we agree .
		4
		the desk staff was extremely helpful and friendly , while the room was pleasant and cozy ( small ) , which was absolutely fine , as our primary criteria for selecting the chancellor were price and location , and on those counts we could not be more pleased .
		4
		the pluses have been noted , while a minus would be the rather thin walls , so hope for quiet neighbors .
		4
		great restaurant ( sears ) next door .

		lovely hotel at a fabulous location we booked this hotel for our 2- day 3- nights weekend vacation in san francisco after reading many positive reviews of it .
		3
		and , we are extremely happy that we did it .
		4
		first , the location of the hotel is as good as it gets .
		4
		there is a shuttle bus running around the clock door - to - door from the airport to the hotel .
		2
		the cable cars run right outside of the hotel , so we could hop on one randomly as we walk .
		4
		although we were strangers to the city , we found it absolutely painless to do our visits using public transportations because everything is nearby .
		0
		we took bart to berkeley and used muni around the city .
		4
		we also found ourselves right in the center of a shopping and restaurant haven .
		0
		we were able to find vegetarian or vegetarian - friendly places with fabulous food ( such as asia sf , golden era , both of which are highly ranked on tripadvisor ) all within walking distance .
		4
		and , we were thrilled to find that even china town was only 3 blocks away .
		4
		we made a pretty aggressive to - do list for the trip , and we were surprisingly happy to see that we got to do them all , because we did not lose any time on transportation .
		4
		second , like a lot of others said , although the room is small , it is clean , lovely , and extremely quiet .
		4
		at the end of the day , nothing beats a peaceful good sleep .
		2
		overall , we feel it 's really worth every penny we paid , and we definitely will book it again when we visit san francisco again

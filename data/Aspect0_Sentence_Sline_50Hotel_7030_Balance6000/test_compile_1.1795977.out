		i can only describe their reception as totally inefficient  non communicative ! i have been trying to book two rooms for seven nights accommodation in august but they have so far ( three weeks later ! ) failed to respond at all to my two e mail requests . having read the glowing reviews of service , i feel very disapointed and have decided that they do not deserve our business . i have never experienced this degree of poor service from a hotel before in all my years of travel .

		[0.281 0.272 0.240 0.107 0.100]
		i recommend not ordering any additional items through the hotel 's website , or if you do , call ahead to make sure they are following through . my wife and i were staying at the casablanca for our tenth wedding anniversary , which the hotel knew .
		[0.242 0.251 0.232 0.138 0.137]
		when i booked our stay , i ordered ( as a surprise to my wife ) add - ons that the hotel offers on its website : a bottle of champagne , a bottle of red wine , and flowers to be waiting in our room for our arrival .
		[0.150 0.206 0.229 0.196 0.218]
		the total price of the add - ons was about $150. the items were a no - show .
		[0.091 0.155 0.201 0.289 0.264]
		they apologized when i pointed out the omission , and offered to make the champagne complimentary and deliver the flowers the next day . we ended up cancelling our stay , so i wo not comment on the hotel other than to say that everything else seemed very nice , the location is fantastic for times square access , and the staff and management were genuinely upset that they had made the mistake , apologizing many times .
		[0.154 0.210 0.236 0.194 0.205]

		[0.331 0.274 0.222 0.097 0.075]

		[0.148 0.208 0.231 0.212 0.201]
		what made this especially galling is that we had received a phone call from the casablanca management the day before we arrived , to confirm that we would be coming for a four - night stay (3/27/04-3/31/04) .
		[0.280 0.260 0.226 0.113 0.121]

		[0.165 0.209 0.221 0.220 0.184]
		they packed us off to the royalton , right around the corner , and paid the difference in room rate for the first two nights , but they expected us to come back to the casablanca for the last two nights .

		[0.058 0.125 0.186 0.305 0.327]

		[0.061 0.125 0.182 0.338 0.295]
		i chose this hotel because it was a great location - and the rooms and accomodations looked special - which i wanted them to have .

		[0.140 0.194 0.230 0.214 0.222]
		on the day before , the hotel called my home and left a somewhat threatening message - if i did not call to confirm before 7:30 the night before - the room would be re - booked .
		[0.284 0.263 0.215 0.122 0.117]
		i was out of town for the weekend already and did not get the message until 3 days later . i reluctantly called my parents to find out about their horrible treatment - they were assured that the guests who were booked for friday night refused to leave - and they ca not kick them out .
		[0.443 0.276 0.179 0.053 0.049]

		for the birds we knew what we were getting into by selecting a hotel with no ac - but after looking at the average temperatures for sf - we thought we would be ok .
		[0.126 0.184 0.214 0.261 0.215]

		[0.131 0.194 0.228 0.213 0.233]
		we were in sf during the recent heat wave - it was very hot and miserable to sleep at the chancellor as we had a front room , the window had no screens ( there were crows on the balcony - not exactly something you want to wake up to ) so our room had no air flow .
		[0.218 0.240 0.225 0.153 0.163]
		it was so helpful ( not ) that they offered us electric fans as we checked out - in that heat situation - those should have been offered to all guests .
		[0.296 0.265 0.214 0.117 0.109]
		the room was a good 20 degrees warmer than the outside temperature .
		[0.102 0.170 0.209 0.268 0.252]

		[0.089 0.152 0.198 0.280 0.281]
		the bathroom was also very small ( the door barely clears the toilet ) with no frills .

		[0.124 0.182 0.222 0.216 0.257]

		i had mistakenly believed that the extremely bad reviews were simply written by high maintenance or difficult guests and that the reviews were most likely a reflection of the reviewer not the hotel .
		[0.146 0.198 0.220 0.255 0.180]
		i am pretty laid back , no frills , and i tend to be very personable , and appreciative , so i thought i would not have any major problems .

		[0.356 0.275 0.212 0.078 0.079]
		there was a clock behind her and she was at a computer which i assume had the time on it .
		[0.215 0.236 0.224 0.162 0.163]
		also , i had requested via e - mail and confirmed by phone a room with 2 double beds on the club level , and when we checked in it was obvious that they had given all those rooms away .
		[0.290 0.265 0.225 0.113 0.106]

		[0.452 0.274 0.179 0.051 0.044]
		when i said that i had called a few days before to double check on my request for double beds , they insinuated that i was lying by stating that they had no record of the call ever having taken place .
		[0.484 0.271 0.164 0.043 0.038]

		[0.407 0.269 0.188 0.075 0.061]
		the front desk manager did not apologize for the unprofessional manner of the front desk clerk - she simply said , well , we have no record that you ever called so i have no choice but to give both of you the benefit of the doubt . . . i 'm sorry but we have no proof that the call ver took place .

		[0.302 0.248 0.243 0.114 0.093]

		[0.242 0.246 0.226 0.150 0.137]
		however when we called to request the complimentary in - room coffee service given to club guests , they said that we did not have club privileges .
		[0.291 0.258 0.214 0.128 0.109]
		i explained that we did have privileges even though we were staying on a different floor , and could he check in the computer to verify ?
		[0.350 0.273 0.211 0.084 0.082]

		[0.389 0.276 0.198 0.070 0.067]
		i mean c 'mon , it 's not that hard to call back - they are the front desk !
		[0.392 0.276 0.192 0.071 0.069]
		i later learned that the system was down , and therefore the person i spoke with was unable to look us up on the computer and because i was calling from a non - club floor , he assumed i was not a club guest .
		[0.348 0.272 0.210 0.090 0.080]
		but then why did not he explain that the system was down , and they were unable to confirm my status ?

		[0.309 0.268 0.223 0.108 0.092]

		so i decided to go back to sleep and called back down to make sure that they would still call us at 8. the person who answered said rudely yes , we already have it in our computer , an 8am wake up call .

		a disaster from start to finish review written dec 10, 2006 - i visited the el conquistador from dec 2-9, 2006 with a large group of about 500 people for a corporate meeting/convention .
		[0.198 0.233 0.230 0.186 0.154]
		to begin , our company provided us with some cash upon arrrival for use during the week .
		[0.252 0.258 0.238 0.132 0.119]
		at several times during the week , about 20 or so of my colleagues were robbed from their rooms of cash , passports , cell phones and pda 's including from their in - room safe , which suggested an inside job .
		[0.201 0.236 0.234 0.168 0.160]
		these robberies took place while we were in meetings during the day .
		[0.380 0.274 0.204 0.075 0.066]
		security was contacted and they made reports to the management .
		[0.521 0.264 0.152 0.038 0.025]
		those who were robbed were made to feel that it was their fault .
		[0.379 0.275 0.204 0.077 0.065]
		security even told one of my colleagues that the whole situation was overblown , which in my mind was absurd .
		[0.434 0.275 0.187 0.056 0.047]
		even one robbery was too many in my estimation ! !although advertised as a 5 star resort , the rooms were very tired and desperately in need of a complete overhaul .
		[0.222 0.244 0.231 0.144 0.159]
		my first room ( i moved after one night ) when i arrived at midnight had water all over the floor and the carpet was soaking wet .

		the bathrooms were not clean either .
		[0.083 0.146 0.200 0.289 0.281]

		[0.138 0.198 0.224 0.214 0.225]

		beware of this property first and worst is the theft ring that works the property from the inside , while the resort claims this is not a usual problem . . the more we investigate the more we find this is very much the norm , even rampant there and we have only been checking into this for a few hours since we returned .
		[0.253 0.255 0.232 0.129 0.131]

		but this was just the begining .
		[0.128 0.184 0.222 0.215 0.250]

		[0.403 0.273 0.194 0.067 0.064]
		almost all the food was dry and rubbery and seems to be that boxed , frozen and fried foods from costco type companies . . nothing is very fresh at the pool and beach areas except the nicer restraunts that have decent service and are only open at night .
		[0.223 0.246 0.232 0.149 0.150]
		i left the resort crying for real food with some actual nutritional value .
		[0.308 0.268 0.222 0.109 0.093]
		there are no vegetables and you would think that fruit would be a big part of a tropical island but to my surprise they were stingy with the fruits and vegies all over the island .
		[0.131 0.187 0.216 0.244 0.223]
		the el conquistador has no real representation of latin food so the puerto rican experience is non - existant here .
		[0.061 0.124 0.180 0.347 0.288]
		we left the compound to get that . the beach was tiny and you have to go to palomino island to get to it , they have reggaeton music blareing through a bad sound system the whole time so you cant enjoy the sound of the ocean .
		[0.309 0.268 0.221 0.103 0.099]

		[0.143 0.203 0.228 0.202 0.223]
		they told us not to go anywhere unless you take one of thier tours due to unsafe conditions around the island .
		[0.430 0.277 0.178 0.066 0.050]
		so you can stay and keep using your room key to charge to .

		a nightmare vacation my husband an i and my parents arrived there very excited , my husband was there for the medical symposium conference . we checked in to a nightmare of a room , my parents an i were given adjoining rooms , mine was a room for the handicapped , which only had a shower .
		[0.282 0.263 0.226 0.115 0.115]
		we had no air conditioner for the first three days we were there on the second day i let housekeeping know that the room was very hot and humid making our clothes and our bedsheets very moist and musty , it was so humid on the second night i actually had an asthma attack , i went down to the front desk and it took them till the third day to fix the problem . the worst part was the shower , since it was a room for the handicapped it had an open shower which allowed the water to flood the bathroom everytime you tried to shower it got so bad that the water was actually seeping out in to the hallway , making it a very dangerous situation .
		[0.311 0.269 0.220 0.100 0.099]

		[0.376 0.277 0.201 0.075 0.071]
		on the third day i slipped and fell injurying my right knee when i hit the floor , also the water reached the closet in the bathroom and all our shoes were soaking wet the maid helped me put them out on the balcony to dryi was in tears .
		[0.261 0.259 0.230 0.128 0.123]
		at that point i went to the front desk to complain only to be given the run around , it took 25 min of waiting before anyone would actually come out to speak with me , i would think that if someone got hurt at a major hotel someone would be out in 2 seconds to handle the problem , well i lost it and demanded to speak with the hotel manager , which by the way we never saw , they sent the room director who basically said they did not have another room to give us at that time , and who never reported the fall i took in the bathroom no incident report was ever filed by mr angelo perez .
		[0.413 0.277 0.191 0.062 0.057]
		i was appalled at how insensitive this whole situation was treated .
		[0.382 0.274 0.199 0.078 0.067]
		we arrived there on feb 5th and were not offered a room change until feb 10th which we turned down since they would not move my parents with us .
		[0.365 0.276 0.198 0.090 0.071]
		he did offer us a complimentary dinner at what he said was their best restaurant , to which we were told we would have to pay for our own drinks , at the restaurant we were seated at a table in a corner near the kitchen , making us feel like bad children , it was a lackluster meal at best and we felt like we were being punished .
		[0.317 0.269 0.219 0.097 0.099]
		my husband conveyed this entiment to the room director on feb 11th , he called us back and said that they wanted to move us to one of the casitas , in their haste they deactivated our room keys with all our things still in our rooms , i lost it and went back to the front desk and told them to let us back in our rooms and that with 2 days left in our stay we would not be moving there really was no point .
		[0.443 0.275 0.181 0.052 0.050]
		on feb 12th mr perez ask my husband to meet with him , we were offered a 1000.00
		[0.334 0.274 0.205 0.103 0.084]
		refund for our trouble and 2 free nights , only to find out that out of the 1000.00
		[0.274 0.242 0.255 0.122 0.108]
		credit they were deducting the 2 free nights and the complimentary dinner they had given us on friday night , when i asked about that the response i got was well we have to pay the restaurant for the meal somehow , it was awful .
		[0.329 0.270 0.214 0.093 0.093]
		they also over charged us for the transfer from the airport to the hotel which they had to review and take off and . the fact that i fell in their hotel bathroom , or had an asthma attack directly related to the hot , humid room or that i had to wear wet shoes to the so - called complimentary dinner and the attitude we recieved from the staff , seem to have no effect on them at all .
		[0.313 0.270 0.220 0.099 0.099]
		it was shameful and humiliating for us , my expierience at this hotel will never be forgotten , but the worst part is that in beingan ocuupational therapist and my husband a physician we made it clear that if that bathroom was a hazard for us imagine how dangerous it would be for truly physically disabled person , to which the response was what would you like us to do ? if you plan to stay there , make sure you are told everything , the hidden housekeeping charge of 3.00 per day the charge for the bellman as well as a resort tariff , whatever that is .
		[0.274 0.261 0.225 0.114 0.125]
		the rooms were dusty and dirty , plates removed from our room were left in front of our door all day with flies buzzing around it was disgusting i had to finally take the plates away myself and put them in the ice room , also the ice machines on our floor were broken , and the worst was having to push dirty wet towels around on the floor used to soak up the water on the bathroom floor after showers , they did send up someone to unclog the drain , but the water still flooded the floor , so we resorted to taking showers in my parents room , which had a tub .
		[0.324 0.271 0.216 0.097 0.092]
		the food is very expensive and and not very good at all , which we elected to eat outside of the hotel . it was an awful hotel and made for a very bad vacation , so i caution anyone before choosing this place .

		i arrived without a reservation , yet despite being a whyndam by request ember ( which is their version of a priority guest ) , despite the fact that the hotel advertised a web price of $228, the hotel would not honor this , even after confirming that i was correct , they stuck fastidiously to their walk in rate of $269.
		[0.263 0.258 0.230 0.123 0.127]

		[0.267 0.261 0.230 0.124 0.118]

		after spending the week of christmas with our entire extended family at the paradisus , we found the resort grounds beautiful and well manicured , and we found the staff to be friendly , if a bit slow .
		[0.217 0.242 0.235 0.152 0.154]
		check - in was truly painful and slow , taking well over an hour even though everything had been prepaid .

		[0.284 0.264 0.219 0.128 0.104]
		one thing that cannot be overstated is the extremely low quality of much of the food .

		[0.091 0.150 0.221 0.268 0.271]

		again , everything on the buffet was cold : eggs , sausage , undercooked bacon , . . . . .there was a made - to - oder omelet station which was good if you did not mind waiting in line . every order of fish or seafood our party had over the course of the entire week , regardless of restaurant or time of day , was cold , old or undercooked .

		[0.357 0.275 0.207 0.084 0.077]

		the steak house had some of the poorest quality cuts of steak i 've encountered .
		[0.107 0.170 0.208 0.290 0.223]
		i 'm not being unkind here : very stringy and tough t - bones with more than 60% fat instead of meat .
		[0.214 0.243 0.235 0.161 0.146]
		other cuts our party ordered were of equally low quality with the expection of the tenderloin which was good . we had a special anniversary meal planned the the japanese restaurant , which required reservations .
		[0.262 0.259 0.233 0.130 0.117]
		of course , the reservation was recorded for the wrong evening and # of people , so we did not get to celebrate the special day as a family , or on the right day . beware of checkout : the maids reported that one room in our party had hidden a guest in their room , so they charged us for an extra person .
		[0.305 0.268 0.220 0.103 0.105]
		of course , this was not true .
		[0.189 0.221 0.227 0.185 0.177]

		[0.200 0.236 0.244 0.163 0.158]
		for example , there was the housekeeper 's or previous guests ' hair all over the floor in our suite .
		[0.094 0.158 0.202 0.295 0.250]
		so , my wife had to do extra cleaning herself .
		[0.348 0.269 0.208 0.090 0.085]

		lunch in the restaurant by the beach is not bad , but same dishes every day .
		[0.305 0.267 0.220 0.103 0.105]
		one day , my wife found a rubber band in her food at this restaurant !
		[0.329 0.269 0.209 0.101 0.092]
		the main reason we chose this hotel was the all - inclusive activities , such as scuba diving .
		[0.187 0.228 0.225 0.187 0.173]
		howvever , because of the constant waves ( and as we found out later , there are huge waves at this particular place of punta cana because of its location ) , i could not do any scuba diving .
		[0.212 0.240 0.224 0.160 0.164]
		so , we had to book a separate trip to catalina island in the caribbean sea ( near la romana ) , where i did scuba diving , and my family enjoyed snorkeling , both for extra charge , obviously .
		[0.154 0.209 0.222 0.208 0.208]
		we did not feel safe at the beach , especially for our little daughter , because there are a lot of strangers there roaming around trying to sell you smth or sign you up for smth .
		[0.267 0.258 0.228 0.120 0.127]
		the nightly entertainment shows are very poor and of low quality . we also had problems with our keys , twice .
		[0.236 0.242 0.224 0.168 0.129]
		when we tried using them to open the door to our room , they did not work .
		[0.444 0.269 0.176 0.062 0.049]
		and mind it - because of the huge hotel territory , it takes you 15 minutes to get to the lobby to fix them . another thing - there is no alcohol in your room 's bar , and the choice of alcoholic beverages on the hotel 's property is very poor .
		[0.196 0.228 0.223 0.174 0.179]
		one more thing - they are trying to promote the reserve area of this hotel by booking you on a 90- minute tour ( which in reality took three hours ) , with the purpose of making you sign up for some kind of a timeshare .
		[0.201 0.235 0.236 0.163 0.165]
		our concierge said that if we attend the tour , we will get a one week of free stay at the reserve , valid for the next two years .
		[0.261 0.255 0.231 0.125 0.128]
		so , we attended this three hour tour and totally wasted our time , and the people were puttting a lot of pressure on us trying to make us sign up for this program .
		[0.320 0.273 0.218 0.097 0.092]
		we refused at the end , and guess what ?
		[0.358 0.275 0.210 0.082 0.075]
		they did not offer us any free stay at the reserve !
		[0.307 0.263 0.215 0.112 0.103]
		( and the concierge later said that they recently discontinued doing so ) .
		[0.299 0.259 0.217 0.123 0.102]
		so , we really very much regretted wasting our precious vacation time on this . here is our advice - stay away from this particular place , it is not worth your money , it is such a dissapointment .
		[0.114 0.173 0.210 0.248 0.256]
		if you are planning a trip to the dominican republic , choose a hotel at the caribbean coast .

		if you need a fork bring your own .
		[0.193 0.224 0.231 0.177 0.175]
		if you need soda go get it yourself at the bar before you eat .
		[0.199 0.227 0.225 0.190 0.160]
		as a matter of fact get 3 or 4 drinks so you do not have to keep getting up .
		[0.315 0.265 0.218 0.104 0.098]
		these people do not ask their guests if they would like refills .

		i 've used this website as a reference many times before travelling , and i never felt compelled to write a review until now .
		[0.160 0.207 0.221 0.228 0.183]
		consider this review a warning to anyone pondering a vacation at this destination .
		[0.396 0.275 0.199 0.074 0.056]
		our family of 4 vacations every year .
		[0.388 0.274 0.201 0.077 0.060]
		what we seek are nice accomodations , beautiful beach , good food , and no hassles .
		[0.188 0.224 0.231 0.166 0.191]
		we are not snobs and would have no problem staying at a marriott on the beach as long as it was quiet , comfortable , and clean .
		[0.107 0.172 0.215 0.223 0.283]
		when we book at what is deemed a 4- star hotel we come with high expectations .
		[0.172 0.213 0.227 0.196 0.192]
		this was our first mistake .
		[0.419 0.275 0.188 0.064 0.054]
		here is my laundry list :1) the royal service is a waste of money .
		[0.222 0.236 0.223 0.177 0.142]
		my husband and i paid for a rs room which was identical to our children 's regular room with the exception of the ocean view .
		[0.219 0.241 0.234 0.151 0.155]
		actually , our kids ' room was nicer .
		[0.248 0.250 0.233 0.141 0.128]
		our room did not even have a door to the bathroom .
		[0.254 0.247 0.230 0.135 0.133]
		it was a 'corral ' style swing door affording no privacy whatsoever .
		[0.178 0.223 0.225 0.197 0.177]
		they claim to reserve a part of the beach and pool for rs , but they never checked .
		[0.402 0.275 0.197 0.068 0.057]
		anyone could use their beach and pool .
		[0.319 0.259 0.227 0.102 0.093]
		we downgraded to a regular room after seeing this , which was half the price .2)
		[0.099 0.162 0.205 0.284 0.250]
		we moved rooms 3 times .
		[0.207 0.234 0.239 0.166 0.153]
		and not one of the rooms had a bed that was remotely comfortable .
		[0.098 0.161 0.203 0.272 0.267]
		the first room would not cool down sufficiently .
		[0.190 0.223 0.227 0.182 0.178]
		the next room had 2 double beds , which were so rickety that whenever my husband rolled over in bed it creaked so loudly that it woke me up .
		[0.400 0.277 0.194 0.068 0.061]
		the next room they gave us had such a musty smell and so many flies in the room .
		[0.321 0.271 0.216 0.096 0.096]
		we finally settled on a room in a building that bordered an adjacent property that must have had a working farm , and every morning at 5:45 we were woken up by roosters .
		[0.301 0.267 0.223 0.104 0.105]
		the water pressure in the shower was almost non - existent .
		[0.242 0.254 0.232 0.142 0.130]
		and bring your own conditioner , they only have shampoo .
		[0.433 0.275 0.185 0.060 0.047]
		and bring bug spray with deet .
		[0.189 0.231 0.227 0.193 0.160]
		you 'll need it every night .3)
		[0.110 0.171 0.211 0.284 0.223]
		the food .
		[0.308 0.261 0.219 0.105 0.107]
		and i use that term loosely .
		[0.211 0.230 0.229 0.158 0.171]
		firstly , eat a huge breakfast .
		[0.062 0.119 0.216 0.321 0.282]
		this is the only passable meal of the day .
		[0.128 0.187 0.214 0.240 0.230]
		if you want a decent dinner , you need to make reservations which you cannot do until you actually arrive at the resort , at which time they have nothing available .
		[0.327 0.269 0.216 0.096 0.093]
		you cannot do it by phone , you have to walk down to the clubhouse at the beach and wait in line with everyone else for 1 employee at a computer to search every restaurant for every day you are there .
		[0.271 0.260 0.228 0.118 0.123]
		only to tell you you can eat at 9:30.
		[0.380 0.275 0.202 0.075 0.067]
		when we finally did get a rservation ( and it was only because someone was nice enough to give us theirs that they were not using ) it was at the french restaurant that was awful .
		[0.407 0.275 0.193 0.064 0.061]
		the steak restaurant too was bad , chinese was worse , and the italian was basically stouffers entrees with elio 's pizza .
		[0.144 0.198 0.220 0.243 0.195]
		the only good restaurant we ate at was the japanese one .
		[0.204 0.231 0.233 0.159 0.173]
		my husband walked in there on our last night and tipped the hostess to let us eat at 6:45 without a reservation .
		[0.429 0.275 0.186 0.058 0.052]
		the best move we made was the night we got in a cab and went to the hard rock cafe and tony roma 's 15 minutes away from the resort .4)
		[0.125 0.184 0.215 0.257 0.219]
		the beach .
		[0.242 0.243 0.230 0.139 0.147]
		if you are used to caribbean beaches where the water is turquoise glass , and you can walk in and see your feet , this is not the beach for you .
		[0.138 0.192 0.220 0.230 0.221]
		the surf had crashing waves and an undertow .
		[0.303 0.265 0.222 0.114 0.095]
		we went snorkling one day and could not imagine that a 15 minute boat ride would take us to a reef that had calm waters .
		[0.300 0.268 0.223 0.113 0.095]
		of course , it did not .
		[0.251 0.247 0.230 0.133 0.139]
		and the snorkling trip they provide is mediocre , at best .
		[0.204 0.238 0.234 0.166 0.158]
		the equipment is passed on from one group to another without even cleaning the snorkles !
		[0.357 0.276 0.206 0.085 0.076]
		my husband is an early riser , but even he was not early enough because by 7:30 am all the shaded bali beds were taken .
		[0.342 0.274 0.211 0.088 0.085]
		we realized that people were putting towels on chairs the night before , and thus we had to do the same in order to have chairs on the beach .
		[0.372 0.275 0.204 0.076 0.072]
		this is way too much of a hassle when you 're on vacation .
		[0.278 0.259 0.227 0.118 0.117]
		there is no one serving drinks on the beach .
		[0.172 0.214 0.223 0.201 0.190]
		every time you want a drink ( and at an all inclusive , there are plenty of drinks being served ) you have to get up and go to a bar and get it yourself .
		[0.164 0.208 0.225 0.202 0.202]
		the help is kind and friendly but speak very little english .
		[0.072 0.137 0.197 0.285 0.309]
		some of the most basic requests were not understood .
		[0.273 0.263 0.229 0.131 0.105]
		( i . e . 'where is the bathroom ? ' )5)
		[0.125 0.188 0.220 0.220 0.247]
		the casino is tiny .
		[0.053 0.117 0.182 0.321 0.328]
		do not come for the nightlife .
		[0.431 0.273 0.186 0.061 0.049]
		if you must come here , there is only one place on the property i would stay .
		[0.145 0.197 0.225 0.203 0.230]
		it is a beautiful brand new complex with decent restaurants and a beautiful pool the rooms are brand new and very chic .
		[0.064 0.131 0.189 0.283 0.333]
		however , if you are beach people and want to go back to your room during the day , it 's a hike .
		[0.157 0.203 0.220 0.207 0.213]
		they provide jitneys that take you back and forth .
		[0.477 0.269 0.171 0.047 0.036]
		there was one thing that lingered with us .
		[0.377 0.269 0.202 0.077 0.075]
		as we unzipped our bags back at home , the musty smell from our room was right back with us .
		[0.289 0.259 0.218 0.119 0.116]
		every article of clothing needed to be washed and fumigated .
		[0.357 0.274 0.211 0.088 0.070]
		the memento of one huge disappointment in punta cana .

		[0.371 0.271 0.204 0.080 0.073]
		upon arrival with two other couples , we were told they were overbooked and we had to stay at bavaro princess next door .
		[0.493 0.268 0.163 0.041 0.036]
		we argued for 5 hours as the rooms they showed us next door were horrendous ( cockroaches , no ac in one room , musty smell ) .
		[0.352 0.276 0.210 0.085 0.077]
		we were told repeatedly that we needed to sign a waiver and would get $100 a night .
		[0.306 0.270 0.221 0.100 0.103]
		long story short , we stayed next door one night and came back next day for more arguing .
		[0.286 0.263 0.229 0.115 0.107]

		[0.304 0.271 0.229 0.096 0.099]
		be warned , do not go here .
		[0.349 0.272 0.213 0.087 0.080]
		if you go and they try to scam you , do not sign that waiver .

		held hostage in punta cana we arrived at the hotel on april 11 and waited over 4 hours before they told us they had no rooms available .
		[0.522 0.246 0.168 0.038 0.027]
		during those 4 hours , no one suggested that there was a room availability problem .
		[0.360 0.274 0.209 0.085 0.072]
		the manager told us that it was our problem and there was nothing he could do but put us up at the bavaro princess .

		no customer service 1. when we got to the hotel , there were many employees who were standing around doing nothing .
		[0.437 0.273 0.184 0.058 0.048]
		no one offtered any assistance .2.
		[0.411 0.278 0.185 0.074 0.051]

		not what expected for the price the dominican republic is a beautiful country to visit , however the paradisus needs to make some adjustments before i ever go back .
		[0.302 0.264 0.220 0.109 0.105]
		the resort itself is not the problem .
		[0.250 0.248 0.231 0.138 0.134]
		it is the royal service that the club offers .
		[0.179 0.218 0.225 0.196 0.182]
		it is way overrated .
		[0.041 0.100 0.158 0.365 0.336]
		you do not get what you pay for .
		[0.395 0.269 0.198 0.071 0.067]
		we never heard from our butler except for the first day that we arrived .
		[0.374 0.272 0.196 0.085 0.073]
		all our information about the area came from an employee that we ran into in the front lobby named miguel .
		[0.344 0.273 0.213 0.091 0.079]
		this is what the butler was supposed to do .
		[0.398 0.274 0.197 0.071 0.061]
		if it had not been for him , we would not have known which restuarants to eat in and what time you could even go there .
		[0.262 0.250 0.218 0.140 0.130]
		the times we called for our butler he never called back or they would tell us he was not there .
		[0.639 0.229 0.105 0.015 0.012]
		we never spoke to him beyond the first day .
		[0.557 0.255 0.137 0.028 0.022]
		they also tell you that when you have royal service you can call them for room service .
		[0.519 0.258 0.154 0.036 0.032]
		this is a joke .
		[0.246 0.248 0.231 0.140 0.135]
		every time we called vip , we were told to call room service .
		[0.616 0.236 0.114 0.019 0.016]
		we also had to stay on the fartherest side of the resort .
		[0.184 0.219 0.233 0.173 0.192]
		the private beach area was on the opposite side .
		[0.070 0.134 0.187 0.309 0.300]
		we found that it was easier to stay on the side that our room was on .
		[0.168 0.209 0.221 0.203 0.199]
		the reason for this is because the resort is in the process of building the private pool for vip .
		[0.253 0.254 0.231 0.130 0.132]
		this meant that they had the area blocked off that lead to the private beach .
		[0.412 0.275 0.193 0.065 0.056]
		you had to then walk the long way around and then go back to the beach area .
		[0.338 0.266 0.214 0.094 0.088]
		we did go to the private beach area once needless to say we did not go back for the above reason but also because the service you get is nonexistant .
		[0.312 0.266 0.218 0.100 0.104]
		they came around once and asked us what we wanted to drink .
		[0.559 0.251 0.138 0.029 0.023]
		plus anyone had access to this beach .
		[0.249 0.248 0.234 0.146 0.124]
		the only difference between the two beach areas were the chairs in the private beach area were more comfortable .
		[0.088 0.153 0.201 0.275 0.284]
		overall the beach was clean and well kept .
		[0.049 0.110 0.176 0.302 0.363]
		the reservations that are made for you at the restuarants , you can make yourself .
		[0.153 0.201 0.220 0.225 0.201]
		you do not need them to make this for you . our butler also did not inform us about the pillow menu .
		[0.421 0.276 0.188 0.061 0.054]
		we did not find the form for this until 10 minutes before check out .
		[0.493 0.269 0.162 0.041 0.035]
		also we were not told anywhere by anyone that if you make a credit card call or a calling card call from your room , you will be charged 60 pesos per call for a connection fee .
		[0.347 0.274 0.204 0.093 0.081]
		this can add up in a hurry especially when you are unaware of this charge .
		[0.225 0.244 0.233 0.146 0.153]
		by the way , if anyone has horseback riding experience , i recommend skipping this part of the excursions that are included in the price .
		[0.159 0.209 0.222 0.204 0.206]
		the reason is because if you have any experience you will find the excursion lacking .
		[0.266 0.257 0.222 0.134 0.122]
		most , except for about 2, of the horses are nags and in very poor condition .
		[0.149 0.199 0.218 0.230 0.204]
		they never get beyond the back - beating trot .
		[0.512 0.263 0.157 0.037 0.032]
		i have rode horses for 30 years and this was the most excurciating experience of my life .
		[0.220 0.235 0.222 0.174 0.148]
		my horse liked to have beat me to death and they are like a bunch of pack mules .
		[0.219 0.249 0.243 0.154 0.134]
		we also had to go to several other resorts to pick up people to go riding also .
		[0.339 0.266 0.207 0.103 0.085]
		our trip was supposed to take 1 hour and it ended up taking 3 hours .
		[0.364 0.272 0.207 0.084 0.072]
		i would also like to tell anyone not to use future vacations who uses club caribe as their representative .
		[0.368 0.279 0.204 0.081 0.067]
		we were 4 women , who does not speak any spanish , traveling alone and nobody showed up at the airport to pick us up .
		[0.331 0.272 0.208 0.102 0.087]
		this was a little nerve racking .
		[0.146 0.202 0.228 0.209 0.215]
		they never were at the hotel when they were supposed to be .
		[0.533 0.256 0.149 0.032 0.029]
		we never seen our representative with club caribe except for the day after we arrived and was told that he would take care of everything .
		[0.500 0.269 0.158 0.038 0.034]
		we called him every day thereafter and he never showed up to meet with us like he scheduled .
		[0.625 0.235 0.110 0.017 0.013]
		we were not able to book any excursions nor do any activities trying to meet up with him to confirm our flight .
		[0.479 0.272 0.167 0.046 0.036]
		for example , we had an excursion for snorkeling that is included in the price scheduled for saturday and our representative said that he could meet with us between 10:30 am and 11:30 am , so we cancelled our snorkeling trip ( which was our last day ) to meet with this person and he never showed .
		[0.367 0.277 0.206 0.082 0.069]
		the night before we left he told us on the phone that we just needed to take a taxi .
		[0.394 0.270 0.193 0.077 0.065]
		we had the resort call for a taxi and we arrived at the airport on time .

		we were at paradisus punta cana from march 1 to march 5,2006- - -if i had to stay any longer i would have lost my mind .
		[0.322 0.264 0.212 0.111 0.091]
		actually , i tried to switch to another hotel after breakfast on our second day , but they were full .

		i can make a few positive comments about paradisus , the casino was nice , the beach was beautiful , the japanese restaurant was delicious but otherwise this was the worst resort i have ever stayed at anywhere .
		[0.205 0.232 0.229 0.168 0.166]
		let me preface my comments by the fact that we were in the dominican republic in february from the 2nd thru the 9th and could not wait to go back !
		[0.419 0.277 0.189 0.062 0.053]
		we had stayed at the iberostar bavaro suites on that trip .
		[0.277 0.257 0.218 0.130 0.118]
		i will try to be specific in my criticisms and comments .
		[0.150 0.201 0.219 0.229 0.200]
		my first impression upon driving up was that the resort was tired .
		[0.344 0.268 0.205 0.104 0.078]
		i quickly changed that to rundown and neglected everything was overgrown , none of the landscaping was maintained ; what should have been flowering shrubs were only green , since nothing had been done to them .
		[0.342 0.274 0.212 0.088 0.083]
		the lawns were not maintained .
		[0.288 0.259 0.226 0.117 0.111]
		people had cut paths across the property and nothing had been done to correct them . no one removed any debris from shrubery or lawns .
		[0.368 0.277 0.199 0.086 0.070]
		i did not see one person working on the grounds during the five days that we were there - -either cleaning or maintenance - -with the exception of a worker painting a bridge with oil - based paint at 10am making the entire lobby uninhabitable due to the fumes . ! ! !
		[0.252 0.255 0.221 0.144 0.128]
		the trees outside our royal service room were #2271 were touching the building , coming into the terrace , and making the room dark .
		[0.299 0.267 0.224 0.111 0.099]
		it was like being in a tropical rain forest , dark , and dreary .
		[0.135 0.196 0.228 0.217 0.225]
		the room was basically clean , but someting i have never seen was here . . . .our bathroom had no doors it was on the left as you enter the room , and then there were swinging shutters ( about three feet high ) separating the toilet area .
		[0.203 0.234 0.234 0.154 0.174]
		the linens were thin and shabby . garbage and cigarettes were left in the containers along the paths .
		[0.264 0.260 0.231 0.135 0.110]
		we were walking on the beach by seven . . . .the beach was cleared of seaweed , etc . and then those giant black garbage bags were left at the entrances to the beach all day . . . .you found yourself walking past trash bags at four in the afternoon . .
		[0.269 0.260 0.230 0.126 0.116]
		the feet washers leaving the beach did not work . . . you wound up going to lunch or back to your room with sandy feet .
		[0.269 0.252 0.219 0.147 0.113]
		some days , there werer no towels , someone took one of ours , and when we went to happy hour at the pool , a guest overheard us , and told us that they had to steal towels all week from other guests ! ! - -they tol us how to do it when they were left unattended - - classy no ? half of the beach chairs were broken . . . .no back supports , and all of them were sagging and old , and dirty .
		[0.410 0.277 0.191 0.060 0.062]
		there was no waiter service on the regular beach . . . more to come on that . the buffets were a nauseating experience .
		[0.328 0.268 0.217 0.095 0.092]
		the food selection was very limited , nothing was marked , and you were greeted by raw pork on ice , and raw fish . .the presentation was awful , nothing was hot .
		[0.153 0.203 0.221 0.246 0.177]
		now , i know this will sound unbelievable , but it truly happened : i went to take a piece of french toast from one of the steam tables , when the tongs made contact with the tray , i got an electric shock ! ! !
		[0.320 0.272 0.219 0.100 0.090]
		i called the hostess , she tried the same thing , and she got an electic shock !
		[0.562 0.254 0.135 0.026 0.022]
		there was a conference with some workers , and they unplugged the tray without a word to me .
		[0.206 0.236 0.233 0.157 0.168]
		there was one stone - faced chef making omeletes .
		[0.097 0.168 0.206 0.297 0.232]
		behind him is a giant garbage pail , and a dirty rusted pole . the air - conditioned area at the other buffet had the same greasy hand prints on the glass for two days - - - one being a child 's print at knee height and another a full man 's hand print at eye level . . .
		[0.239 0.252 0.235 0.143 0.130]
		these with assorted greasy smudges . . .what does this tell you ? after my electrocution i had had enough , and went to the general manager . . . mr .
		[0.276 0.251 0.217 0.145 0.111]
		i enumerated my complaints to him , telling him i would have been gone to iberostar bavaro , if they had any rooms . . . he upgraded us to royal service for the remainder of our trip , somewhat better , but in my estimation , not worth it . .
		[0.400 0.277 0.195 0.066 0.063]
		we were moved to a different section of the beach with nice beachchairs , and there was wait service in this section .
		[0.137 0.192 0.218 0.226 0.227]
		however , it was such a small section , that people were right on top of each other . i sat next to a family who came with a cooler bag , and lays potatoe chips - - - and listened to the mom 's concerns about her daughter 's diaper exploding in the water . . . this was all done in a scream .
		[0.197 0.234 0.236 0.163 0.171]
		most of the guests were americans , and there were a good number of screaming kids .
		[0.195 0.231 0.236 0.166 0.172]
		royal service has a separate breakfast room , a nice curtained enclosed room , which again served a limited buffet .
		[0.109 0.176 0.226 0.238 0.250]
		i do not go to the carribean to eat breakfast indoors though , i could have stayed in ny for that ! ! royal service and we had to flag down the waiter for coffee !
		[0.326 0.269 0.217 0.093 0.095]
		and the milk was bad ! ! you ca not make it up ! ! royal service did make our dinner reservations , and liz in that section was ever so nice .
		[0.285 0.255 0.217 0.132 0.112]
		we did not get the promised newspaper in the morning .
		[0.323 0.271 0.210 0.103 0.093]
		i do not want anyone to unpack my bags - - one of the services included , and i would not get into the room jacuzzi , which they would fix for you .
		[0.378 0.276 0.202 0.074 0.070]
		royal service costs $70 per person per nite more , while nice , definitely not worth it , since many of the things you receive are just regular service in other hotels .
		[0.077 0.142 0.192 0.312 0.277]
		and now to top it off , when we were leaving , the cart carrying us and our bags broke down in the middle of the property on the way back to meet our bus ! !
		[0.342 0.272 0.205 0.094 0.086]
		the driver had to flag someone down , transfer our bags , push the one trolly off the path , and we just made our departure bus ! !
		[0.414 0.277 0.191 0.068 0.049]
		you could not make it up ! ! ! having been to the dominican republic twice before , i find this hotel to be an extremely bad representation of the dominican people .
		[0.420 0.273 0.186 0.061 0.060]
		my impression was that the people working at the resort seemed - - in general - -unhappy .
		[0.298 0.266 0.225 0.109 0.103]
		the number of really pleasant people could be noted .
		[0.087 0.151 0.199 0.288 0.275]
		my impression was that the resot might be closing , the manager , mr . castillo said no , they were doing a seven million dollar addition , new pool , beach club for royal service , i suggested that they put some money in general maintenance and service .
		[0.353 0.276 0.208 0.087 0.076]

		poor customer " service " ruined this vacation we are frequent travelers for both business and pleasure , and so have a lot of experience with which to compare this report .
		[0.288 0.267 0.226 0.122 0.097]
		although the beach and resort were lovely , this resort had the poorest customer service we have ever experienced .
		[0.344 0.270 0.212 0.088 0.086]
		although we specifically booked and paid extra for the 'royal service ' what we received was quite the opposite .
		[0.196 0.233 0.237 0.169 0.165]
		i can honestly say we have never been treated more poorly .
		[0.282 0.265 0.225 0.121 0.107]
		we felt tolerated rather than welcome , and there were many times we felt like second - class citizens . a few brief examples : we were placed in an unrenovated room with construction going on in our building when many other rooms appeared to be available .
		[0.207 0.235 0.224 0.166 0.168]
		our request to be moved was declined ( we were told that there was nothing available - although it was clear that some rooms were vacant ! ) .
		[0.330 0.270 0.215 0.092 0.093]
		so we awoke early to banging many mornings . although there was a wine list at each meal , we were repeatedly told that whatever our choices happened to be ( and we went down the list ! ) were not available .
		[0.296 0.267 0.224 0.110 0.103]
		we were asked to chose between 'red ' and 'white ' and then were served the same two , poor quality wines .
		[0.339 0.274 0.212 0.091 0.084]
		however , we watched other ( spanish - speaking ) guests order from the list and different bottles from the list mysteriously appeared at their table .
		[0.278 0.263 0.229 0.123 0.107]
		we were consistently not seen when asking for service on the beach ( supposedly part of the royal service package ) , but spanish speaking guests around us received excellent attention and service .
		[0.325 0.272 0.217 0.098 0.087]
		when i went up to the beach bar myself , i watched as the bartender made me drinks without alcohol , and then insisted they were alcoholic .
		[0.417 0.278 0.189 0.064 0.053]
		when this happened a second time and i said something , he laughed and turned to a co - worker and made some rude remarks in spanish , assuming i would not understand .
		[0.434 0.276 0.184 0.057 0.049]
		( i did not understand it all , but i am aware of the meanings of ' - - - - ' and ' - - - - '.
		[0.156 0.208 0.231 0.187 0.219]
		i assure you they are not complimentary ) .when turnign on a light in our room , i received a severe electrical shock and burn from the lamp , which had old and frayed wiring .
		[0.224 0.245 0.236 0.140 0.155]
		when we told the customer service staff , they appeared unconcerned , and merely said they would remove the lamp ( which they never did ) .
		[0.519 0.264 0.152 0.035 0.030]
		no apology , no offer of medical attention for the burn , which kept me out of both the sun and water . i could go on , but in short , we felt like second - class citizens and were tolerated rather than welcomed .
		[0.210 0.244 0.247 0.146 0.153]
		there were also obvious differences in the way spanish - speaking clientele were treated .
		[0.271 0.263 0.227 0.127 0.112]
		it is unclear whether language barrier difficulties ( most staff , even those specifically in customer service , spoke no or very little english ) contributed to this . my advice ?
		[0.267 0.260 0.229 0.124 0.120]
		the beach is absolutely lovely in punta cana .
		[0.306 0.265 0.219 0.107 0.103]
		stay at another resort .
		[0.330 0.266 0.213 0.096 0.095]
		if , for some reason , you still want to go to paradisus , absolutely do not pay for the upgrade of royal service .
		[0.379 0.272 0.203 0.077 0.070]
		if what we got was royal service , i am afraid to guess how other non - royal guests were treated .

		do not go getting through the airport was a trip by itself ; we filled out an entry form on the plane but there is another one that we have to fill out at the airport and then we have to buy a tourist card .
		[0.262 0.255 0.220 0.135 0.128]
		following local laws is one thing but at least they should post the entry procedures clearly and preferably in english so that we do not get the impression that we are being chipped away .
		[0.308 0.271 0.224 0.108 0.089]
		ground transportation by hotelbeds was ok but an attempt was made to get us to go on tours that are included in our all - inclusive package .
		[0.326 0.272 0.223 0.095 0.084]

		[0.215 0.231 0.253 0.157 0.144]

		[0.430 0.276 0.185 0.058 0.050]
		hotelbeds sent a nice tour bus to pick us up for the airport as promized but the normally 25- minutes trip turned into a 90+ min ride on very bumpy road .

		we have traveled extensively all over the carribean , and this was far from a luxury resort . i will start with our check - in which was smooth .
		[0.257 0.257 0.230 0.127 0.129]
		however , when we were dropped off at the room , it was already occupied .
		[0.249 0.255 0.230 0.133 0.134]
		we sat there for 10 minutes while the bellman/shuttle driver called back up to the lobby ( another family was waiting on the shuttle ) .
		[0.367 0.274 0.208 0.080 0.072]
		finally , he took us to another room and the maid had to let us in .
		[0.600 0.239 0.124 0.021 0.016]
		after 5 calls to the front desk and over an hour of being stranded in our new room , we had new keys .
		[0.340 0.271 0.213 0.088 0.088]
		on one call , they had the nerve to ask us to call back in 5 minutes because they were busy checking people in .
		[0.533 0.261 0.147 0.032 0.028]
		the rooms are not bad , but not exactly what i would consider 5- star luxury . finally , we head out to explore the resort .
		[0.310 0.261 0.214 0.122 0.094]
		the pool area is beautiful and the foliage thruout the resort is very well maintained .
		[0.062 0.123 0.182 0.292 0.342]
		the ocean is breathtaking and the beach is clean .
		[0.019 0.061 0.119 0.374 0.426]
		that 's about it for the positives . the entire resort is under renovation which means electric saws , drills , workers everywhere .
		[0.109 0.173 0.209 0.276 0.233]
		you could not even hear the music in the bar for the construction .
		[0.195 0.228 0.233 0.170 0.174]
		there were men busting out sidewalks , installing new roofs , painting , etc .
		[0.152 0.200 0.220 0.233 0.196]
		you constantly had to stand to the side to let a worker with a wheelbarrow or load of palm fronds get by .
		[0.345 0.274 0.212 0.087 0.082]
		and it was no different on the beach .
		[0.213 0.234 0.232 0.153 0.168]
		they were building a new cabana on the beach complete with electric saws again so we moved down away from those sounds .
		[0.103 0.168 0.207 0.285 0.237]
		only to be greeted by the scent of fresh paint as they touched up the massage cabana on the beach .
		[0.179 0.219 0.223 0.211 0.168]
		and if you want a chair , make sure you break the rules and leave towels on it 24/7.
		[0.112 0.175 0.211 0.273 0.229]
		there are signs everywhere that you ca not save chairs unless someone is there , but it is not enforced . restaurants and service in general were fair .
		[0.167 0.210 0.223 0.214 0.186]
		make sure you ask for reservations before you get there - - - i emailed the hotel directly and had reservations waiting when we arrived .
		[0.272 0.252 0.219 0.141 0.116]
		the only restaurant where we had a great meal and service was el romantico .
		[0.112 0.178 0.219 0.226 0.265]
		the japanese was a joke - - we had an 8pm reservation , got seated at 8:50 and did not get a drink until 9:10.
		[0.404 0.277 0.192 0.065 0.061]
		everything else was so - so , including the buffet which was basically the same everyday .
		[0.267 0.255 0.229 0.129 0.120]
		but the people in the restaurants generally do not understand service .
		[0.397 0.273 0.196 0.070 0.064]
		the service in the bars is much better . regarding the included excursions , two words - - good luck .
		[0.220 0.243 0.236 0.157 0.144]
		everything was booked up when we arrived .
		[0.381 0.270 0.202 0.078 0.070]
		they only take 30 people horseback riding per day (15 each twice per day ) and it is only 3 days of the week .
		[0.294 0.263 0.216 0.118 0.108]
		same with scuba , snorkel , shopping , etc .
		[0.101 0.173 0.225 0.270 0.232]
		when the shopping excursion was full , the resort offered to have a boat take me there and wait to bring me back for a fee of $40.
		[0.180 0.219 0.226 0.193 0.182]
		we opted to go on our own after we learned it is a 10 minute walk from the resort .
		[0.291 0.265 0.227 0.110 0.106]
		you can get there by walking on the beach or out of the front lobby . needless to say , i would not recommend this resort to anyone .
		[0.292 0.262 0.223 0.107 0.116]
		perhaps when all the renovations are complete , this resort will live up to it 's name .
		[0.259 0.258 0.237 0.133 0.114]

		worst vacation ever taken my husband and i stayed at the paradisus may 6-13, 2003.
		[0.500 0.267 0.160 0.040 0.032]
		upon arrival , we were very impressed with the grounds , decor , etc . upon checking in ( around 1pm ) we were told our room would be ready in 45 mins .
		[0.192 0.224 0.223 0.198 0.162]
		we went to have lunch and when we returned almost an hr and half later our room was still not ready .
		[0.356 0.268 0.200 0.097 0.078]
		we actually did not have a clean room until 4:30pm the day we arrived .
		[0.304 0.262 0.213 0.116 0.106]
		the pool was very nice and the room although decor was nice smelled very damp and musty .
		[0.069 0.138 0.195 0.278 0.320]
		on our 2nd day there my husband became extremely ill ( stomach pains , etc . ) and remained ill for the entire 7 days we were there .
		[0.250 0.253 0.220 0.145 0.131]
		the food was horrible .
		[0.528 0.259 0.149 0.034 0.030]
		nothing you ate tasted the way it looked .
		[0.241 0.249 0.231 0.150 0.129]
		the meat was very gamey ( my husband is convinced he ate horsemeat ) .
		[0.156 0.206 0.219 0.210 0.209]
		many of the restaurants are outdoors where i have witnessed cockroaches crawling on the food .
		[0.240 0.252 0.222 0.155 0.131]
		many times we were given dirty silverware , glasses , etc .
		[0.112 0.173 0.211 0.274 0.230]
		they never changed their table linens or our sheets on our bed .
		[0.532 0.261 0.148 0.035 0.024]
		we met some very nice people during this trip , which did make the best of a bad situation , but it is extremely disapointing to pay $3000.
		[0.177 0.222 0.234 0.171 0.195]
		for an all - inclusive when you ca not eat or drink .
		[0.331 0.267 0.215 0.095 0.092]
		it is strongly recommended that you speak some spanish , b/c no one there speaks english and the language barrier definately is an issue .
		[0.368 0.275 0.205 0.088 0.063]
		i highly recommend you do your research before considering this resort .
		[0.184 0.220 0.226 0.204 0.167]

		good weight loss clinic . . .
		[0.159 0.214 0.222 0.219 0.185]
		i will start off by saying the grounds were beautiful . . . like being in the middle of a jungle paradise ; however that 's where all the positives stop .
		[0.212 0.235 0.224 0.171 0.157]
		the a/c like others have noticed , was not functional upon arrival .
		[0.259 0.252 0.221 0.154 0.115]
		we changed rooms to find working a/c , but non working refrigeration in the mini refrigerator .
		[0.256 0.256 0.233 0.139 0.116]
		the toilet did not work correctly , but the room was very nice overall . the area of major concern to me , is in what appears to me in my opinion , to be the heavy odor of what smelled like raw sewerage on the grounds and again in my opinion , to be a possible contamination of the food supply or what appeared to be a lack of cold enough temperatures of the food and drinks at the food counters .
		[0.279 0.263 0.227 0.118 0.114]
		by the second day of the vacation , both my wife and myself became very ill and we were unable to eat anything further without violent results .
		[0.256 0.258 0.220 0.142 0.124]
		we switched to eating only small portions of bread followed by bottled beer in order to consume some carbohydrates and sugars .
		[0.245 0.254 0.231 0.144 0.126]
		this helped us to make it through , but barely .
		[0.375 0.274 0.204 0.078 0.068]
		in all my visits to the domincan republic , i have never been ill like this . the food was terrible at best and not consumable at the least , in my opinion .
		[0.413 0.276 0.190 0.061 0.059]
		add in the horrible smells from constant air pollution caused by all of the worn out motors from the trolley 's and motorbikes used by the staff and you have the recipe for a difficult vacation .
		[0.259 0.259 0.235 0.128 0.119]
		i would find another resort with less traffic and possibly safer food . the beach chairs are extremely uncomfortable , making extended sun tanning difficult unless you lay on the sand .
		[0.153 0.204 0.220 0.238 0.185]
		the trash bin plastic bags on the beach where never removed for change ; the attendant would only reach in by hand and remove the dumped daily garbage by hand and transfer the contents to his bag , leaving old food matter constantly drying in the receptacles or on the ground around the bins .
		[0.329 0.274 0.217 0.101 0.079]
		it is almost impossible to communicate with anyone at any restaurant .
		[0.273 0.263 0.228 0.124 0.113]
		my wife has an allergy to garlic and they put garlic in virtually everything .
		[0.348 0.272 0.211 0.086 0.083]
		i asked each and every waiter to avoid garlic ( in spanish ) but i do not even think they know what garlic is .
		[0.393 0.274 0.198 0.070 0.066]
		we ended up with garlic in almost any food item ordered or any item offered at the buffet . the only positive result of the trip was the loss of 6 pounds of weight , which now puts me back at my waist size during college .
		[0.275 0.264 0.227 0.125 0.110]
		i would also avoid tnt tours , the first class extra we paid for was a joke . happy vacationing !

		[0.254 0.251 0.230 0.133 0.132]
		just came back from a week stay at bavaro princess , d . r , big disapointment , before booking the trip for nineteen of my family , i read the reviews on this resort , some were good and some were bad , since it is a five star resort , we are not very picky peaple , and have traveled to punta cana many times before and always had a great time , we stayed at b . p from dec/18?2008 to dec/25/2008 , when we arrive at the resort , it seem like a pretty nice place but seem to be a little dimmed around the lobby , the check in went o . k , no wellcome cocktail drinks , we proceeded to have our dinner , it was just o . k with less variety than usual .
		[0.194 0.230 0.223 0.171 0.181]
		the room we had was near the beach and the main pool , therefore was very convinient for the kids , all of our rooms had crockcroaches and some even had crockcroaches eggs under the pillow cases , we ate at japanese alacart and the seafood , both time we ordered food , everything ended up to be the same , waste of time , food quality was terrible , evening shows were boring , perhaps inexperience m . c made it even more boring , most of the staffs were nice at the bars and at the restaurants , ground keepers worked tiredlessly to keep the property look pretty nice , we enjoyed the wild lifes , flemingos , peakcocks , fish , birds ects . . . . . the most disappointment aprt of the hold trip was the animacion ( enterainment ) crews , they do not seem to have much connection with the resort guests but maby think of themselfs as somekind of superstars , not even a genuend friendly hola , around the pool there were 'nt much activity , first five days , we did 'nt even hear any local music played , only techno music , it did ''nt give the feeling of beeing away , so in summory , the trip was a ripoff , we paid for a 5 star resort but only got maby 3.5 star service .
		[0.173 0.212 0.222 0.212 0.181]

		do not do it . . . head the warnings and bad reviews . . . book somewhere else ! my wife and i booked our honeymoon through a travel agent in our area with apple vacations .
		[0.341 0.273 0.213 0.090 0.083]
		the price seemed more than fair and by the personal recommendation of the travel agent we booked our honeymoon to the bavaro princess resort in punta cana .
		[0.290 0.259 0.216 0.132 0.102]
		we paid for the platinum upgrade , which as explained to us , would entitle us to premium alcohol , nicer room , extra nice meals and other amenities .
		[0.257 0.256 0.230 0.132 0.125]
		upon arriving at our resort , we were taken to the platinum lounge were we proceeded to wait for two hours before we could check in to our room .
		[0.458 0.272 0.177 0.049 0.043]
		now , we do understand that people may have checked out of that room late , but after observing how slow the housekeeping was during the week , we are guessing that was the cause .
		[0.335 0.270 0.214 0.090 0.091]
		after waiting over two hours for our room to be ready , we went to the room to find it in what had appeared to be immaculate condition right down to the label on the toilet suggesting it was sanitized .
		[0.359 0.271 0.200 0.087 0.083]
		considering my wife is a clean freak , she inspected the toilet before going to the bathroom to find that there was human ficies still smeared on and around the sanitized toilet .
		[0.276 0.243 0.241 0.125 0.115]
		outraged , we called the platinum lounge to express our concern and they assured us that someone would be over right away to re - clean it .
		[0.308 0.270 0.219 0.104 0.099]
		several phone calls later and several hours having passed , a maid did finally show up to clean said toilet .
		[0.470 0.273 0.171 0.049 0.037]
		a few hours later we spent some time killing huge cock roaches that seemed to come out of the wood work near the tv and couches .
		[0.311 0.269 0.222 0.106 0.093]
		we expressed our concern about these issues to the apple rep at our resort and he assured us he would take care of it .
		[0.528 0.263 0.149 0.034 0.026]
		he did offer to have our room exterminated but we would not be able to be in it for several hours after .
		[0.359 0.268 0.212 0.084 0.076]
		several hours later and several times of reminding him that we were waiting to hear back from him , he informed us that the manager was going to send champaign to our room for the inconvenience .
		[0.470 0.272 0.171 0.047 0.041]
		the following day , our 10 dollar bottle of champaign arrived with a small cheese plate .

		[0.320 0.268 0.219 0.101 0.092]
		the restaurants that were included as part of our platinum upgrade were worse then the buffet food in the main dining room .
		[0.320 0.268 0.218 0.100 0.094]
		we paid for the platinum upgrade especially to receive the premium alcohol , and every time we asked for anything to be considered premium , they were out of it .
		[0.337 0.270 0.206 0.102 0.085]
		we did not get anything premium until we went to the bar at one of the sister resorts we were allowed to go to .
		[0.403 0.270 0.189 0.077 0.061]
		we booked two excursions with apple by recommendation of the reps at the resort , which were the outback safari and the dolphin island .

		the dolphin island excursion was a different story .
		[0.176 0.220 0.231 0.199 0.174]

		the bad thing is that only an hour of it was spent actually near the dolphins .
		[0.180 0.218 0.222 0.200 0.180]

		[0.199 0.228 0.230 0.171 0.172]

		[0.349 0.273 0.211 0.089 0.079]
		we were taken back to the beach where they proceeded to sell us dvds with photos from our experience .
		[0.470 0.273 0.171 0.049 0.037]
		this privilege cost us another 30 bucks .
		[0.221 0.240 0.225 0.174 0.141]

		[0.502 0.268 0.158 0.039 0.034]
		several people were complaining to the staff but it seemed the staff was only concerned with making sure everyone bought a dvd before getting back on the buses .

		i had read some reviews about this resort prior to traveling there and the most popular complaint was regarding transportation issues .
		[0.285 0.265 0.227 0.122 0.102]
		the resort is set on a few acres and it is a bit of a walk from the beach to the main lobby or from the rooms to the buffet .
		[0.109 0.171 0.217 0.235 0.268]
		the resort has a vehicle that stops at several designated areas to pick people up .
		[0.353 0.274 0.209 0.093 0.070]
		nine times out of ten this vehicle was full by the time it reached us so we decided to walk the rest of our time there .
		[0.296 0.269 0.233 0.111 0.092]
		this proved to be a bad idea since the road to walk on went through an area where the resort had a sewage problem .
		[0.332 0.273 0.219 0.096 0.081]
		i can?? even describe how bad the stench was in this area .
		[0.253 0.248 0.220 0.143 0.136]

		[0.380 0.274 0.204 0.078 0.063]
		i am sure walking past this area four times a day on average was not good for our overall health .
		[0.122 0.187 0.224 0.222 0.245]

		they informed us that ten minutes we be sufficient .

		[0.333 0.271 0.207 0.100 0.090]
		35 minutes later , they finally showed up to grab our baggage and we raced to the main lobby to catch our bus .
		[0.464 0.275 0.177 0.049 0.035]

		i am one of three thirty year old women that were just interested in a relaxing vacation .
		[0.278 0.261 0.226 0.120 0.114]

		[0.317 0.268 0.218 0.097 0.100]
		we were offered the special room to change into our bathing suits upon arrival , and the room was trashed and we would not want to know what was going on in there the night before , but we had an idea .
		[0.275 0.259 0.217 0.122 0.127]
		not the best first impression .
		[0.134 0.192 0.218 0.241 0.215]

		[0.402 0.273 0.187 0.074 0.065]
		we got there on a sunday and they did not move us until late afternoon on tuesday , so we would go and use the lobby bathroom .
		[0.328 0.271 0.216 0.094 0.091]
		when we got into our next room the toilet did not work , so we had someone in to fix that .

		[0.433 0.274 0.184 0.055 0.054]
		pretty scary thought .
		[0.193 0.225 0.238 0.210 0.134]
		i could go on with the other bad experiences , but to sum it up , i think because we were all female , that did not make a big enough fuss about our problems , they really did not care about making sure we were happy .
		[0.236 0.241 0.221 0.164 0.138]
		i do not know about you , but when i pay to go on vacation , i want the memories to be great and not something i have to spend time after warning others to prepare themselves for disappointment if they are going to that resort .

		after 2 days we had enough .
		[0.435 0.270 0.185 0.060 0.051]
		we spent in this hotel barely 2 days of weekend , taking voluntarily temporary assingement form our occidental flamenco hotel due to overbooking .
		[0.292 0.265 0.225 0.112 0.105]
		it was quite a disaster , we were so happy to leave bavarro and return to flamenco . the only good thing was a room .
		[0.183 0.223 0.231 0.164 0.198]
		clean spacious and bright , we had no problem accomodate in 4 ppl .
		[0.137 0.202 0.229 0.223 0.209]

		[0.338 0.272 0.209 0.095 0.086]

		[0.153 0.210 0.231 0.204 0.202]
		this resort is spread on vast grounds , the trains seem to be always crowded , and finding seat during evening hours seemed impossible . the worst was food .
		[0.279 0.265 0.227 0.124 0.106]
		the main buffet is open without ac , we did not enjoy eating while getting sweat at the same time .
		[0.314 0.271 0.220 0.102 0.094]
		and food was bad , plain and tasteless .
		[0.260 0.260 0.229 0.131 0.119]
		one evening it was all about oriental food , we noticed more ppl ended up @ american station taking hamburgers and hotdogs rather than oriental cuisine . and final nail was chopin restaurant .
		[0.209 0.242 0.235 0.171 0.144]
		not sure why its called that , because its in fact an open buffet , with lots of seafood .
		[0.282 0.259 0.227 0.120 0.112]

		[0.218 0.234 0.223 0.194 0.131]
		and to tell the truth , after all iiwas not surprised , seeing flies and moths getting cozy in some salads . so after spending 2 days in bavarro , we could not wait to get back to occidental flamenco , where we enjoyed far superior quality and overall satisfaction .

		4th and last time !
		[0.240 0.231 0.252 0.161 0.116]
		last week i stayed at this resort , party of 2. we had platinum service .
		[0.412 0.274 0.192 0.065 0.057]
		this was my 4th visit in 3 years to this resort , all of which were either platinum , or the previous vip program . the vacation was through ac vacations , and the flight down from toronto was excellent .
		[0.192 0.224 0.223 0.197 0.164]
		we were bumped up to business class for free at the gate , and the flight was on time . we arrived at the resort at around 11am , and after waiting for one of the golf carts that ferries guests around for 10 minutes in order to go check in at the platinum lounge , we have up and walked to it - - since we are familiar with the resort .
		[0.285 0.263 0.224 0.112 0.117]
		when we got to the lounge , we were the first to check in from our arriving group , suggesting the golf cart transportation had still not arrived .
		[0.351 0.270 0.203 0.093 0.083]
		perhaps not suprisingly , our room would not be ready until 3pm , the stated check in time .
		[0.352 0.276 0.213 0.084 0.075]
		that 's fine . . . we just went to lunch and waited around .
		[0.226 0.240 0.232 0.147 0.156]
		when we went back at 3, they told up 3:30.
		[0.631 0.233 0.107 0.016 0.013]
		more waiting , and more waiting ensued until 4:30, when we were given our room .
		[0.371 0.275 0.203 0.075 0.076]
		why was not my room ready ?
		[0.512 0.259 0.163 0.036 0.030]
		well , my room was not ready because the guest in there before just did not check out .
		[0.353 0.269 0.209 0.085 0.084]
		i was comforted by the desk agent by him telling me that they had charged the guest $40 dollars for our inconvenience .
		[0.439 0.277 0.182 0.056 0.046]
		of course , we were not given the $40 bucks , or really anything for that matter other than shrugged shoulders . the room was ideally situated , close to the pool , beach and lounge . . . but the a/c hardly worked , and the water pressure all week was terrible .
		[0.161 0.206 0.221 0.225 0.187]
		we got fed up with the a/c on the second day , and they moved us up to an ocean view suite which also had bad a/c , no water pressure , no hot water except at times that you do not need it ( like 2pm ) .
		[0.336 0.273 0.214 0.089 0.088]
		i complained a few times , but eventually gave up - - not worth the effort , as the management was pretty apathetic . we met two other couples who had the same problems in platinum .
		[0.301 0.265 0.223 0.109 0.101]
		in fact , one couple was given a non - platinum suite and the only compensation offered was an extra 20 min massage . . . and that was after a lot of effort going through the ac vacations rep . food : the only things i had all week that were good was steak at el gaucho , pasta at the pasta station in the hispaniola buffet , and boiled eggs by the beach in the morning .
		[0.218 0.244 0.234 0.154 0.150]
		my partner actually picked up some rotten pineapple at one of the buffets , which was less than appetizing to her .
		[0.360 0.275 0.213 0.080 0.072]
		the food here has really went downhill .
		[0.183 0.227 0.234 0.178 0.178]
		the worst was el pescador , the fish restaurant .
		[0.284 0.264 0.226 0.121 0.104]
		everything was cold , and tasted bad .
		[0.151 0.204 0.221 0.222 0.201]
		luckily , a guest services manager was hovering around in that restaurant and intercepted me as i was leaving .
		[0.327 0.254 0.238 0.097 0.084]
		this was the only positive experience i had with management , as she apologized and immediately had us seated at el gaucho .
		[0.410 0.277 0.193 0.067 0.054]
		this resort needs more of that kind of management . beach : excellent , although many of the chaise loungers were broken .
		[0.288 0.263 0.225 0.113 0.110]
		sea was just marvelous . pool : dirty .
		[0.306 0.249 0.240 0.112 0.093]
		it was painted white , and you could see yellow slime on the sides of the pool .
		[0.161 0.207 0.221 0.228 0.182]
		otherwise , the pool was good .
		[0.126 0.178 0.242 0.227 0.227]
		the pool bar was often understaffed - - one guy trying his darnedest to serve a full bar of people .
		[0.343 0.273 0.208 0.094 0.083]
		a couple of the days they put 2 guys on and it was better . casino : that was ok , had fun at $10 blackjack , but the a/c there was a bit weak too . excursions : ( this has nothing to do with the hotel , by the way ) we did the saona excursion , and it was bad .
		[0.161 0.205 0.220 0.214 0.200]
		it is a long bus ride , then you go out on speed boats . . . which was very fun .
		[0.156 0.207 0.221 0.204 0.211]
		they take you to a natural pool in the ocean and feed you drinks , then back into the boat for a ride over to saona , which is supposedly an unspoiled beach .
		[0.226 0.245 0.236 0.141 0.151]
		what we got was an unspoiled beach that was set up with relentless dominican craft vendors , where we had to spend 3 hours .
		[0.319 0.262 0.210 0.113 0.096]
		after that , we had a wonderful sail for 1.5 hrs in a tropical storm , then a bus ride to punta cana with a stop in higuey - - actually , they dumped us at a tourist place where we could buy rum and paintings at american prices . the highlight of the trip was coming home .
		[0.220 0.247 0.234 0.149 0.151]
		from now on , my home in the d . r . will be the paradisus palma real where we went at christmas .
		[0.338 0.271 0.205 0.100 0.086]
		it is more expensive , but at the same time you do get something for your money .

		[0.219 0.239 0.225 0.194 0.122]

		[0.227 0.236 0.222 0.164 0.151]
		you expect at the very least not to be ripped off too badly .
		[0.332 0.271 0.217 0.098 0.082]
		my fianc? and i knew we wanted to stay an additional day at the bavaro princess , and when we checked in we asked the gentleman at the front desk ( julio ) if this was possible .
		[0.378 0.275 0.202 0.073 0.072]
		he checked his computer and confirmed that there would be no problem and told us to contact our travel agent to book the additional night .
		[0.538 0.260 0.144 0.033 0.025]
		at day 3 we contacted our travel agent and made the arrangement .
		[0.430 0.276 0.185 0.058 0.051]
		i again asked the front desk ( pablo ) if there would be a problem and the man again checked the computer , and said ??o problem? ?
		[0.213 0.233 0.223 0.181 0.151]
		then late on the evening before we were to leave , my agent called me and said that the hotel rejected our extra - night reservation since the entire resort was ??ooked? ?
		[0.451 0.270 0.180 0.052 0.047]
		since we had already changed our flight ( and they knew this since julio explicitly asked me if we had done so ) , i felt the hotel had pulled a switch in order to exploit a minor amount of money from me .
		[0.362 0.275 0.207 0.081 0.076]
		i contacted my travel agent and he said it sounded like they just wanted to charge me the full $360 rate instead of the $250 i agreed to pay earlier .
		[0.391 0.279 0.199 0.072 0.060]
		sure enough , my suite ??ecame available? ? when
		[0.382 0.271 0.203 0.077 0.067]

		[0.447 0.268 0.180 0.054 0.051]

		[0.475 0.271 0.170 0.047 0.037]

		[0.367 0.274 0.206 0.080 0.073]
		my agent and i are now looking for a new location .

		fortunately , there are dozens and dozens of alternatives , in punta cana .
		[0.354 0.254 0.231 0.085 0.077]
		i can?? believe the head - quarters for this hotel would approve of their front desk people ??xtorting? ? a
		[0.344 0.269 0.211 0.085 0.091]
		petty $110 in lieu of the fact that they lost a $12,000 reservation ( and that figure is looking very conservative ) .
		[0.255 0.252 0.230 0.126 0.137]
		but i guess they figure they can just rebook the lost suites .
		[0.319 0.272 0.217 0.101 0.091]
		but i would think ( or hope ) that such unprofessional practices will eventually begin to hurt their bottom line .
		[0.154 0.207 0.221 0.239 0.178]

		[0.328 0.271 0.216 0.095 0.090]

		[0.483 0.267 0.165 0.046 0.039]

		[0.506 0.267 0.157 0.039 0.030]
		we walked over to the hotel we were suppose to be at and we could not find a nail or a hammer anywhere there were no renovations .
		[0.322 0.270 0.216 0.096 0.096]
		so basically they were trying to move us all into one resort so that they did not have to have both open but did not want to close the other one so that people would still book with princess . i will touch on three the following issues 1. drugs in my drink ;2. all restaurants closed ( except main buffet ) ;3. rooms not ready ;4.
		[0.340 0.269 0.207 0.098 0.086]
		luggage didn?? show up ;5.
		[0.458 0.271 0.176 0.060 0.035]
		not enough trains for the big resort to take you from lobby , your room or pool  beach ;6. staff wedding day wearing jeans ;7. no making reservations ;8. lights out by 11:30 on resort ( can?? find you way around )9. septic smells so badso when we got the bavaro princess at 1:30 pm all of our rooms were not ready . . including the bride and groom?? .
		[0.349 0.277 0.210 0.088 0.076]
		we had to wait until 3:30 until we got them . . some of us still did not get them to after 4:30.
		[0.598 0.244 0.120 0.021 0.017]
		we then had to wait for our bags from there bell boys until 5:30 pm . that was awful service .
		[0.479 0.273 0.165 0.046 0.037]
		the rooms were really nice but our phone did not work and i asked everyday for a new phone but no one came to bring one . . . despite all my complaints .
		[0.275 0.257 0.228 0.122 0.118]
		i even went to the front desk and they told me that ??aybe? ? they would be able to send someone to look at it .
		[0.536 0.257 0.143 0.034 0.030]
		they even recommended that i go back to my room with one of their off duty staff to look at it with him .
		[0.429 0.274 0.186 0.057 0.054]
		i am a 25 year old woman and there is no way i would feel safe going back to my room with a man i don?? even know that isn?? wearing a staff uniform or a name tag to look at my broken phone .
		[0.310 0.270 0.219 0.104 0.098]
		still no phone even on our last day when they said they would fix it and give us a wake up call so we wouldn?? miss our flight . the resort is huge so walking from the lobby to the beach or even to your rooms is at least 15 minutes? ? and the septic smell in one section is soooo strong that it is enough to make you gag .
		[0.366 0.273 0.197 0.087 0.078]
		they also turn the lights out before 11:30 at night so the entire resort is dark and you can?? find you way along the dark paths or even see room numbers of all the villa?? .
		[0.265 0.261 0.228 0.126 0.120]
		my friends mom was walking alone from the buffet at night and they shut down the lights and she came back to the buffet really worked up , upset and scared .
		[0.197 0.228 0.223 0.196 0.156]
		even though there are guards with guns on the beach infront of the resort it doesn?? really make it feel any safer when it is completely dark .
		[0.250 0.253 0.233 0.129 0.136]
		the trolleys that drive you around don?? run late and even if they are running ( before midnight ) they drive past you and are often full of people .
		[0.264 0.251 0.220 0.150 0.115]
		they only had one running so you had to wait over 25 mins for one to come by you and it would be full and wouldn?? stop .
		[0.366 0.277 0.203 0.077 0.077]
		it happened to rain everyday we were there so we often stood in the rain waiting . all the restaurants were closed and they just had the buffet open .
		[0.304 0.268 0.222 0.105 0.101]
		sometimes you had to wait in line to even get in .
		[0.396 0.262 0.210 0.072 0.061]
		if you called to make a reservation for one of the promised restaurants they would say they are booked and then when you would go to them they were empty .
		[0.518 0.262 0.153 0.035 0.031]
		they were suppose to be available but they weren?? and they moved the special restaurants into the main buffet so they didn?? have to have the other buildings open . for my friends wedding the staff was disorganized and not very accommodating . . they kept moving the location on us . my one friend?? dad went to complain to the manager and they said they would try to up the service a bit? ?
		[0.417 0.276 0.190 0.061 0.056]

		[0.418 0.276 0.190 0.062 0.055]
		we booked another day trip to go fishing and they messed up the days and switched it to the day of the wedding when no one could go . we were suppose to stay at the tropical princess down the beach but two weeks before they switched us to this hotel due to renovations . . we went to see it and there were no renovations . . just a slow time of year and they didn?? want both of their hotels running? ? complete

( and u better have a reservation ) after an all day at the beach with 100 degree weather , then go ahead - almost entire resort no ac .
		[0.261 0.259 0.231 0.127 0.122]
		i mean noooooooooooo ac for someone traveling with kids not a good placehotel service - workers are terrible , no customer service , rude people , i had my phone broken for 3 days b4 anyone cared to fix it , no one to complaint to , do it in writing when u get back home they suggested - if for any reason you flight is delayed , pray to god anyone tells you , there will be a note posted on a binder for you to read , where is the binder ?
		[0.364 0.277 0.207 0.080 0.073]
		hahahahahso good luck - no accomodations provided if ur flight is delayed , again u wait under 100 degree weather , with no room or shower for ur kids or even urself , -hotel is not responsible if transportation between airport and resort isnt on time , so u might even lose ur flight - in the event of a flight delay , if you came in with apple tour , please be ready , you will be given only a 3 minutes long distance phone call after 6 hours wait . , again no room provided - no one is allowed in hotel if they dun have a bracelet , of course excluding those providing a happy ending for certain guests , - only 2 pools , and if you are vip , make sure u dun request a towel at the non vip pool , wont get it , vip pool barely cleaned , u can actually smell the urine - vip isnt any different than anyone else , u still be given watered down alcohol , not worthywatch out for the train ! ! , yes train to transport u to ur room and back to lobby , and they dun run 24/7only + about it was the entertainment at night - please you dont wanna experience this for urself , bigger is not any better

		[0.199 0.225 0.224 0.185 0.166]
		first of all , there was no hot water at all and we were there for seven days ! ! ! ! ! seocndally , they gave us a promotional 100$ royal dollars to cash in for the casino - -very good promotion , however to cash it you need to attend a meeting .
		[0.183 0.218 0.224 0.199 0.176]
		it would be good if they explain this because i brought it to the casino and they did not know what to do with it and then the hotel lobby told me i had to attend the meeting - -i am on vacation and do not have time to attend meetings , i just want to have fun ! ! ! ! lastly , the service at the information desk is only spanis , i understand that is there main tongue , however , it is a resort with several tourists , having them be bilingual would be more of an asset . . . especially since it is the information desk ? ! ?

		[0.330 0.269 0.217 0.099 0.084]

		this trip was ten years in the making and something we had worked , saved and planned for .
		[0.134 0.191 0.218 0.252 0.205]
		to say the trip was a disappointment would be a gross understatement .
		[0.218 0.241 0.226 0.167 0.149]
		our initial welcoming into the hotel was non existent , we got off the hotel shuttle as we watched our bags thrown on the sidewalk .
		[0.254 0.258 0.233 0.136 0.120]
		after waiting several minutes for some kind of greeting , direction , explanation , and several attempts to speak to the bellhops we were pointed in the direction of the front desk and told to leave our belongings out front .
		[0.360 0.278 0.206 0.083 0.073]
		we approached the front desk which had no line just masses of people bunched around the counter .
		[0.362 0.276 0.209 0.079 0.075]
		when we finally were able to get someone to respond to us we were told that our room was not ready and we would have to wait another 30 minutes .
		[0.593 0.245 0.123 0.021 0.018]
		check in time was 3:00, we were told this at approximately 3:15.
		[0.488 0.269 0.165 0.043 0.036]
		we waited the 30 minutes and returned to a similar scene at the front desk .
		[0.361 0.274 0.202 0.088 0.074]
		the woman working the desk completely ignored us for about 10 minutes before finally telling us she would check our room .
		[0.507 0.268 0.155 0.039 0.031]
		we stood there for another 30-40 minutes while she repeatedly took other customers without ever checking on our room .
		[0.456 0.275 0.176 0.052 0.040]
		at one point she took the information booklet she had given us earlier containing our towel passes and with our room number written on it and crossed out the room number and gave it to another customer in line .
		[0.305 0.270 0.219 0.105 0.101]
		we finally were given a room after approximately an hour and a half , and more than a full hour after check in time .
		[0.329 0.270 0.216 0.091 0.094]
		although i understand things happen and rooms are not always ready on time , it was the complete lack of concern , apology , or even common courtesy that was very upsetting .
		[0.226 0.249 0.236 0.152 0.138]
		the front desk acted as if we should be grateful we got a room at all .
		[0.375 0.276 0.202 0.076 0.071]
		our next incident occurred when we went to retrieve our bags from out front , which were still sprawled on the sidewalk where they had been thrown .
		[0.461 0.275 0.173 0.048 0.044]
		obviously eager to finally get to the room , we asked the bellhop to please take them to our room .
		[0.569 0.251 0.136 0.025 0.018]
		we were told they would be there in 2 hours !
		[0.564 0.250 0.135 0.026 0.025]
		not willing to wait that long , my husband had to carry them the considerable distance to our room since , we were told by several passing workers in golf carts that they could not give us a ride .
		[0.521 0.264 0.152 0.036 0.028]
		we had hoped that this would be an end to the problems on our much - anticipated trip .
		[0.299 0.266 0.223 0.106 0.105]
		the same unsatisfactory and many times down right rude customer service that greeted us on our arrival continued through out the trip .
		[0.214 0.236 0.224 0.173 0.153]
		dinner reservations were messed up , we were told we had none , until we physically had to point to our name on the list and show the ??ost? ? where it was .
		[0.470 0.273 0.171 0.046 0.041]
		countless times we were out right ignored while trying to take advantage of the ??ll inclusive? ? services .
		[0.436 0.276 0.183 0.058 0.047]
		simple requests like ??ay i have two beers ? ? ? were answered with stares if at all .
		[0.415 0.274 0.192 0.065 0.054]
		our room , which we had been so desperate to get into , was located directly above a room being renovated .
		[0.284 0.263 0.225 0.116 0.111]
		drills and saws are not part of what i consider a relaxing vacation .
		[0.212 0.231 0.227 0.175 0.155]
		when we asked to be moved because of the disruption , we were told no .
		[0.454 0.271 0.172 0.055 0.048]
		as a matter of fact the only thing the staff did seem ready to respond to any request was no !
		[0.324 0.271 0.217 0.097 0.091]
		the one thing we did enjoy about this trip , a snorkeling tour , not affiliated with the meli? caribe tropical , was even ruined by the hotel .
		[0.286 0.265 0.224 0.111 0.114]
		we ordered a dvd of the experience to share with our family .
		[0.188 0.222 0.224 0.201 0.165]
		the dvd was delivered to the hotel , which lost it .
		[0.124 0.182 0.215 0.258 0.221]
		again , we were met with the same poor attitude that was the norm on this trip , ??h well , it is not here , there is nothing we can do? ?
		[0.241 0.251 0.229 0.128 0.152]
		never in my life did i think i would be counting the days until my dream vacation was over .
		[0.449 0.270 0.172 0.060 0.050]
		this trip was a nightmare from start to finish .
		[0.280 0.263 0.228 0.123 0.106]
		i have never written a letter like this before , but i can not in good conscience let anyone else spend their hard earned money and wasted their all too precious time with loved ones experiencing the things my husband and i dealt with while at the meli? caribe tropical .

		terrible service , inconsistent food , all - in - all a horrible experience if you are looking for excellent service , great food , and management that is responsive to your needs , this is not the place for you .
		[0.264 0.256 0.230 0.120 0.129]
		i heard some good things about punta cana and my ta highly recommended this resort .
		[0.244 0.247 0.223 0.160 0.125]
		the nightmare started at check - in , while we were kept waiting over an hour just to register .
		[0.409 0.278 0.192 0.064 0.057]
		it went downhill from there .
		[0.326 0.273 0.216 0.099 0.087]
		the service was extremely spotty ; while some of the workers were wonderful , the hotel management was extremely rude and arrogant .
		[0.258 0.254 0.228 0.131 0.129]
		do not expect to get reservations in any restaurants unless you tip one of the workers to make one for you .
		[0.450 0.272 0.178 0.052 0.047]
		the kicker when when my husband broke his foot on the property , and management did absolutely nothing to help us or make our stay easier .
		[0.325 0.265 0.209 0.114 0.087]
		in fact , they made him walk close to a mile , with a broken toe , to medical services .
		[0.273 0.264 0.227 0.124 0.112]
		the management never provided the ride they promised , and any worker in a golf cart he tried to flag down would not give him a ride because he had a wrong color bracelet on .
		[0.350 0.276 0.201 0.095 0.078]
		meanwhile , this man is in excruciating pain .
		[0.298 0.265 0.224 0.112 0.101]
		what kind of people are these ? ?the food was good at some meals , inedible at others .
		[0.277 0.260 0.226 0.116 0.121]
		my daughter 's room was infested with 100s of tiny ants .
		[0.276 0.262 0.230 0.126 0.106]
		they were in the bed , in the bathroom , in her clothes , everywhere and the management gave us nothing but arguments when we wanted to move .
		[0.380 0.273 0.200 0.075 0.071]
		unless you are staying in the royal service expect nothing better than 2- star treatment ; and even the royal service , while better , was inconsistent .
		[0.350 0.273 0.211 0.087 0.079]
		some rooms had bathrobes , others none .
		[0.236 0.250 0.234 0.151 0.129]
		we did not get the daily newspaper , suite treats or turndown service promised .
		[0.225 0.242 0.223 0.186 0.123]
		if you complain to management you get lip service - -if you 're lucky .
		[0.421 0.276 0.188 0.062 0.052]
		usually , you get an argument .
		[0.346 0.275 0.216 0.093 0.070]
		to say the service was deplorable is an understatement . i am extremely sorry i listened to my ta 's recommendation to book this resort and i am telling everyone i can to never , never travel to this resort .
		[0.403 0.276 0.195 0.067 0.058]
		please save your money ! in case you are thinking i am being fussy , i spoke to 3 other american couples ( one from texas , one from philadelphia , and another from nj ) who had the same complaints we had .
		[0.275 0.253 0.218 0.148 0.105]

		beware dates visited melia caribe tropical 6/19/08 until 6/27/08.
		[0.768 0.165 0.060 0.004 0.002]
		on my urging my wife booked our trip through travelocity for the two of us and our three children and my brother who had his own room .
		[0.340 0.274 0.211 0.087 0.088]
		immediately upon our arrival to the resort the employees at the concierge desk were very eager to help us make dinner reservations for that night and in return we attend a 90 minute presentation of a sol melia vacation club . that night we ate at the guarapo the dominican restaurant which was very good as were all the restaurants the problem was getting a reservation .
		[0.336 0.271 0.216 0.092 0.085]
		dinner reservations are obtained by calling ext 6313 after 9 am but by the time you get through at around 9:15 am everthing was taken so you would need to call at 1:30 pm to see if there were any cancellations so instead of enjoying yourself at the beach or pool you needed to be worried about getting back to the room to call again .
		[0.397 0.276 0.196 0.067 0.063]
		the problem with the reservations for dinner goes back to the sol melia vacation club as the employees use it as a way to get you to go in exchange for dinner reservations they get points ?
		[0.436 0.276 0.183 0.056 0.049]
		for referring guests .
		[0.261 0.251 0.229 0.129 0.131]
		we went to the presentation on the third day of our stay after becoming friendly with guillermo one of the towel boys at the pool .
		[0.272 0.259 0.228 0.120 0.121]
		the presentation actually took around three hours in which they took us to there other resorts which were beautiful but we did not wish to purchase the membership .
		[0.386 0.276 0.198 0.072 0.068]
		my brother was actually confronted by the concierge who had originally had scheduled the presentation he is known as erasmo . com he stopped my brother in the lobby and questioned him as to why we had gone to the presentation after he had made dinner reservations for us .
		[0.403 0.279 0.196 0.069 0.054]
		my brother did not answer this employee but called guest relations and spoke to maralys and told her what had happened and she was very apologetic and would look into it and sent a fruit platter and a bottle of rum to both of our rooms which was a nice gesture but not needed if the employees would just do there job .
		[0.311 0.270 0.222 0.103 0.094]
		speaking of empolyees who do there job well was mario the bartender at the bar he was fantastic . there were many others who are very eager to please . like i said before the restaurants capri ( seafood ) , guarapo ( dominican ) , hokkaido ( japanese ) , ma maison ( french ) were excellent except that my daughter got sick the night after eating in the french restaurant ( she threw up twice ) .
		[0.325 0.271 0.217 0.095 0.092]
		the gondola ( italian ) was ok and the a/c was broken so it was warm in the restaurant .
		[0.163 0.212 0.232 0.187 0.207]
		as far as our room was concerned the a/c was never cold enough the maid would turn off the electricity in the room after cleaning it so when we would come in from the beach/pool we would have to turn it on by turning the card around upon entering the room .
		[0.197 0.226 0.224 0.197 0.156]
		i needed to spend 30 minutes every evening killing the mosquitoes , i also spent alot of time in the bathroom flushing the toilet as there was not alot of water pressure .
		[0.248 0.252 0.231 0.134 0.135]
		i finally figured it out and found a kids sand bucket at the pool and would fill that with water and use it to flush . i actually thought about leaving after our third or fourth day there .
		[0.266 0.262 0.230 0.124 0.119]

		[0.261 0.251 0.220 0.162 0.106]

		the food overall is good but not great .
		[0.030 0.081 0.147 0.324 0.418]

		stay away comfortable is not the word to be used to describe this place . it is true that the resort has grounds are well cared for .
		[0.206 0.236 0.236 0.160 0.161]
		the lobbies and marketplace are nice as well and that is where the positives ended for me . beware : the trains that take you around spew black clouds of nasty smoke and so do the little mopeds that all the staff ride around on .

		the stench and noise is really bad , i??e never been to a place so gassed and smelly in canada or us .
		[0.284 0.262 0.224 0.111 0.118]
		the sidewalks in the alleys are covered in oil so if you are not jumping side to side to give way to passing vehicles while covering your nose you are still forced to smell all the oil that?? evaporating under the sun . the beach stinks of gasoline too because of all the speedboats constantly going by and a little inflatable flying boat .
		[0.322 0.272 0.219 0.100 0.088]
		the washrooms are far from the beach with all the logical consequences and the calm standing waters of the ocean make it nastier .
		[0.187 0.226 0.224 0.173 0.190]
		you have to wear a shirt , shorts and sandals in the beach buffets so if your bathing suit is still damp and you are hungry you again have to be inconvenienced one way or the other . the rooms are old and dated and if you don?? give a bribe your room will probably face a very busy road with roaring smelly vehicles and a train that rings its bell at all hours of day or night .
		[0.213 0.243 0.236 0.155 0.153]
		you are given each one bath towel so if you take a shower in the evening be prepared to use the same old wet towel in the morning .

		and what genius thought of putting the only hooks in the bathroom right over a bide ? the food was mediocre as expected the service was the same ? ? dominicans are a long way from understanding what customer service is .

		asking 3 different people for a drink at breakfast and being reprimanded for being late for dinner ( what happened to the ??ominican time? ? ) because of an issue with a door lock is not enjoyable . so a 2 -3 star resort at best as far as i am concerned !

		the food was acceptable but definitely not 5- star , on arrival , check - in took over 30 minutes at the reception and a further 15 minutes to reach the apartment .
		[0.261 0.259 0.228 0.127 0.125]
		a ground floor apartment had been requested , because of my restricted mobility ; we were given one on the first floor .
		[0.244 0.251 0.227 0.136 0.143]
		the next morning the tour operator?? rep established that ground floor apartments were and had been available at the time of our arrival and arranged for us to be moved .
		[0.320 0.269 0.215 0.102 0.095]
		due to the speed at which the staff operate , this meant a wasted day , mainly because the new apartment?? safe required activation and the electric door keys that had been issued would not function properly .
		[0.289 0.263 0.216 0.133 0.099]
		frequent telephone calls to customer service had no effect .
		[0.641 0.228 0.107 0.018 0.007]
		my partner was therefore forced to hike to and from reception , some 15 minutes away , several times before getting keys that appeared to work .
		[0.318 0.273 0.225 0.105 0.079]
		that evening , the keys failed again and i was stranded for thirty - five minutes , outside at 23:30 hrs .
		[0.220 0.244 0.234 0.149 0.152]
		whilst my partner , yet again , was forced to go to the reception to get the issue resolved .
		[0.309 0.269 0.224 0.110 0.089]
		this however proved to be a temporary resolution as the saga of the keys continued the next day ; entailing further hikes to the reception entailing a further lose of holiday time .
		[0.167 0.211 0.222 0.218 0.181]
		in all , eleven sets of keys were issued , over the course of two days , before a technician finally arrived to service the lock .
		[0.406 0.276 0.192 0.064 0.061]
		the matter was further exacerbated by a failure of the bathroom lock , trapping me in the bathroom .
		[0.205 0.234 0.233 0.160 0.168]
		however , as i threatened to break the window unless action was taken immediately , the technician , this time , arrived quickly to resolve the problem . the apartments were large and generally well cleaned , although sometimes this could be somewhat hit and miss , the procedure for reserving seating at the various restaurants for dinner left a lot to be desired .
		[0.232 0.250 0.235 0.146 0.137]
		on occasions , one was placed on telephone ??old? ? for up to twenty minutes . a diesel driven ??rain? ? service is provided to get around the very large site .
		[0.224 0.245 0.223 0.158 0.151]
		it was supposed to run at fifteen minutes and took approximately a further fifteen minutes to circle the site but as no timetable was published , it could take , if one just missed a ??rain? ? thirty minutes to reach the reception .
		[0.276 0.264 0.226 0.119 0.114]
		the gardens are immaculate , have peacocks running loose and the small lakes have pink flamingos .
		[0.162 0.218 0.229 0.214 0.177]
		there are however several well - disguised marshy areas which caused somewhat of a problem with mosquitoes .
		[0.110 0.172 0.209 0.273 0.236]

		[0.014 0.051 0.108 0.409 0.417]
		the seaweed , obviously outside of the hotel?? control , was kept well in check .
		[0.231 0.244 0.233 0.152 0.140]
		both the pool and beach areas had more than adequate sun beds . new years eve festivities , which continued well into the small hours , were excellent and included a fantastic firework display . overall , the holiday , considering the site layout and general attitude of the management staff , were reminiscent of the ??illy butlins holiday camps? ? of my youth .

		[0.176 0.215 0.225 0.196 0.188]

		my wife and sister - in - law arrived i the morning of july 24 at 4 am .
		[0.261 0.257 0.231 0.132 0.118]
		upon my arrival , the front desk clerk confirmed we had two rooms side by side and my wife just had to sign the check - in card to gain access to the room .
		[0.286 0.261 0.218 0.118 0.117]
		unfortunately , when my wife arrived at the hotel her name had be deleted from the computer .
		[0.274 0.258 0.234 0.125 0.110]
		she had to explain and argue for 30 minutes before she was given a key to our room .
		[0.515 0.265 0.154 0.037 0.028]
		she had provided the voucher showing she had paid the room in advance and that she had a confirmed reservation at the hotel .
		[0.387 0.275 0.192 0.080 0.065]
		the clerk at the front desk refused to even look at her passport or acknowledge the voucher . as for my sister - in - law , she was told that they didn?? have a room for her .
		[0.459 0.274 0.175 0.050 0.043]
		her reservation voucher showed a confirmation for a s single occupancy room .
		[0.311 0.276 0.220 0.119 0.074]
		they also refused to look at her passport or even check if there was information left earlier in the day explaining the arrangement i had obtained upon check - in earlier in the day .
		[0.364 0.277 0.207 0.080 0.073]
		they said no message had been left , but did not appear to have checked .
		[0.561 0.253 0.137 0.028 0.021]
		they then noticed that her name was under my room .
		[0.569 0.250 0.134 0.027 0.020]
		she had to wait for 1 ? hre before she got a room .
		[0.485 0.265 0.169 0.045 0.037]
		i also called the reception desk to help clear up the matter , but to no avail .
		[0.217 0.236 0.223 0.176 0.149]
		2. my sister - in - law was shown to a room that was filty and bad melling .

		[0.439 0.269 0.186 0.057 0.049]
		unfortunately , the room smelled badly of cigar .
		[0.295 0.266 0.219 0.122 0.098]

		[0.032 0.084 0.151 0.324 0.407]
		she asked housekeeping to spray the room for the bad odor and wash the floor .3. the morning my wife arrived , an employee pounded on the door very hard until i answered the door .
		[0.291 0.266 0.224 0.116 0.104]
		we had the ??o not disturb? ? sign

		on the doorknob .
		[0.159 0.205 0.229 0.187 0.221]
		the employee gave us the reservation voucher my wife handed to the clerk upon her arrival ! !
		[0.546 0.260 0.141 0.032 0.021]

		[0.174 0.219 0.223 0.221 0.162]
		we were also awaken at 11.30 pm the same night by the front desk clerk asking us for the number appearing on the identification bracelets given to us upon check - in .

		the safe did not work .
		[0.436 0.269 0.184 0.061 0.050]

		[0.482 0.272 0.165 0.045 0.036]
		it still did not work .
		[0.497 0.263 0.162 0.042 0.035]
		i had to explain a number of times that all this did not work .
		[0.387 0.275 0.200 0.071 0.068]
		they said they would send someone in 45 minutes .
		[0.690 0.206 0.087 0.011 0.007]
		i refused because my daughter was waiting to go to the beach .
		[0.529 0.260 0.151 0.033 0.028]
		in the evening , i asked the front desk clerk for help .
		[0.328 0.269 0.216 0.095 0.092]
		the same explanation was given .
		[0.450 0.275 0.177 0.056 0.041]
		once back in the room , it still did not work .
		[0.327 0.265 0.219 0.097 0.093]
		the next day , i called the front desk , it had been 24 hours since my arrival and the safe was still not activated .
		[0.316 0.262 0.214 0.111 0.098]
		i was starting to feel anxious about leaving valuables unlocked .
		[0.168 0.215 0.223 0.236 0.157]
		finally , an employee at the front desk checked the key , it hadn?? been activated for the safe .
		[0.377 0.274 0.207 0.075 0.068]
		i had to go back to the front desk to have it activated .5.
		[0.468 0.270 0.171 0.046 0.045]
		at our first family dinner , at the los atabales buffet restaurant , we asked the waiter for a spoon for our daughter twice in 15 minutes .
		[0.357 0.275 0.207 0.081 0.079]
		my wife decided to go ask some waiters who standing near the buffet .
		[0.320 0.271 0.216 0.102 0.090]
		they ignored her , so she took the spoon herself .
		[0.582 0.250 0.131 0.021 0.016]
		an employee asked very rudely : ??hat do you want ? ? ? and hit my wife on the shoulder with the top of her hand .
		[0.365 0.276 0.207 0.080 0.072]
		the employee?? name was julianne .6.
		[0.427 0.276 0.187 0.065 0.046]
		the next day , my wife and sister - in - law spent half the day between the front desk and client services explaining what has happened to her the previous evening .
		[0.264 0.255 0.219 0.145 0.117]
		my sister - in - law was still awaiting that a new room and that the room she was occupying be at least cleaned properly .
		[0.317 0.269 0.220 0.099 0.095]
		after waiting a few hours , they were told to register a complaint in writing in a special log book .
		[0.353 0.275 0.211 0.085 0.076]
		they insisted on meeting someone from management .
		[0.527 0.267 0.154 0.032 0.020]
		after more waiting , they finally met mr . edward valdez .
		[0.500 0.269 0.157 0.041 0.034]
		he listened intently , he did not offer an apology , he mentioned that he would investigate the matter , and talk about all this to the director and get back to us .
		[0.503 0.271 0.168 0.032 0.026]
		he asked what he could do in order to make our stay more enjoyable .
		[0.557 0.252 0.139 0.029 0.022]
		in the end he suggested he could reserve the ?? la carte? ? restaurants for us for the duration of our stay .
		[0.430 0.276 0.185 0.058 0.050]
		we asked for a late check - out on august 6.
		[0.203 0.232 0.220 0.186 0.159]
		we were leaving the hotel at 1.30 am on august 7.
		[0.129 0.188 0.210 0.249 0.223]
		my sister in - law asked for a new room , he said he would have to get back to her .
		[0.507 0.266 0.157 0.037 0.032]
		he said he would have her room thoroughly cleaned in the meantime .
		[0.600 0.244 0.120 0.022 0.015]
		mr valdez never came back to us on what happened to my wife in the restaurant .7.
		[0.507 0.245 0.177 0.042 0.029]
		the first restaurant reservation made by mr valdez did not register at the ??merican steak house? ?
		[0.463 0.274 0.173 0.049 0.041]
		we were disappointed and were made to feel that we were lying .
		[0.368 0.274 0.205 0.078 0.075]
		other customers by the way were very irate that evening at the same restaurant .
		[0.278 0.259 0.229 0.116 0.118]
		we agued and finally got a table after the supervisor of restaurants called mr valdez , but she still tried to send us to another restaurant first .
		[0.398 0.272 0.188 0.080 0.061]
		the american steak house : was not full and did not fill up for the rest of the evening .8.
		[0.240 0.253 0.232 0.140 0.135]
		we left two pairs of sandals by a deck chair by the pool .
		[0.328 0.269 0.217 0.095 0.090]
		when we went to get them , they had disappeared .
		[0.640 0.229 0.104 0.015 0.012]
		my wife spent two hours getting directions to the lost and found service .
		[0.231 0.241 0.225 0.166 0.137]
		the towel service clerk did not know where she should go .
		[0.522 0.265 0.150 0.035 0.028]
		she was told to go to the activities pavilion by the beach .
		[0.535 0.255 0.150 0.033 0.027]
		upon her arrival , an employee asked her if she spoke english , and started to laugh , he then entered the pavilion and looked her straight in the eyes and said something in spanish in a low voice .
		[0.459 0.277 0.174 0.051 0.039]
		she promptly left as she felt scared and did not like his condescending way .
		[0.486 0.269 0.168 0.044 0.032]
		she went through the same thing with the towel service clerk , but this time there were some hotel guests present ( all men ) .
		[0.340 0.273 0.214 0.090 0.084]
		they started to stare at the floor .
		[0.405 0.276 0.203 0.061 0.054]
		one of they guest spoke english and helped my wife .
		[0.412 0.272 0.187 0.073 0.055]
		he mentioned she should see the director of activities .
		[0.574 0.249 0.134 0.027 0.016]
		she did , and she lodged a written complaint .
		[0.342 0.270 0.206 0.101 0.081]
		he was very nice and apologized twice for the situation .
		[0.252 0.253 0.238 0.141 0.116]
		he mentioned that he was having problems with some employees .
		[0.518 0.260 0.157 0.038 0.027]
		one of the employees arrived and understood what was going on , turned his back to remove his name badge .
		[0.308 0.264 0.212 0.121 0.095]
		the director apologized again , took down the details of the incident and our room number .9.
		[0.222 0.249 0.236 0.162 0.132]
		one evening upon our return to our room , there were 25 or so ants in the bed sheets .
		[0.290 0.262 0.224 0.114 0.110]
		we did not sleep very well that night .
		[0.183 0.218 0.230 0.186 0.183]
		the next morning , we noticed that the maid was leaving the sheets around were ants could easily find there way in the sheets .
		[0.381 0.274 0.202 0.079 0.063]
		we asked her not to change our sheets anymore .
		[0.576 0.253 0.126 0.026 0.019]
		we paid $9832 canadian for both rooms .
		[0.147 0.200 0.233 0.201 0.219]
		we were supposed to go to riviera maya at your paradisus resort . our trip was cancelled at the last minute because of the hurricane .
		[0.419 0.276 0.189 0.062 0.054]

		[0.325 0.267 0.221 0.100 0.088]
		this wasour worst travel experience .
		[0.658 0.220 0.098 0.014 0.010]

		republic , venezuela , europe , bahamas , hong kong , india , los cabos , riviera maya , guadeloupe ) .

		staying at the fiesta resort , hilton , intercontinental , leela , club med , leading hotels of the world , kempinski , barcelo , nh hotels . we understand that some things could go wrong , but the problems we experienced during our stay at the melia caribe tropical were unacceptable and uncalled for .
		[0.281 0.264 0.224 0.114 0.116]
		there were other problems we experienced daily : rooms cleaned very late , no toilet paper , no water pressure in the shower and toilet .
		[0.301 0.267 0.221 0.111 0.099]
		it seems that the problems stem by overworked staff , lack of training in basic customer service and bad management on behalf of the hotel management .

		[0.146 0.198 0.219 0.228 0.208]

		smelly , surly , clean , do not understand the hype i spend 6-8 weeks a year in new york city , mostly for business but sometimes for pleasure , and have tried numerous hotels rated on trip advisor , usually with excellent results .
		[0.095 0.169 0.227 0.262 0.247]
		i will not come back to hotel casablanca . although the hotel has some nice amenities ( that they are proud of ) such as wine and cheese from 5-8 pm , that did not make up for the lack of security , and the horrible , horrible sausage smell in our room .
		[0.165 0.208 0.221 0.214 0.193]
		yes , sausage .
		[0.241 0.252 0.236 0.163 0.108]
		i was also sorely disappointed with the level of professionalism and service from the front desk staff . security first , as that is a more specific and tangible concern .
		[0.198 0.234 0.235 0.160 0.173]
		there is usually just one person behind the front desk , and when we walked in at 11:00 pm on sunday evening ( no doorman , except once during the three days and two nights we were there ) he did not even look up from whatever he was doing and only greeted us when we were already up the stairs .
		[0.396 0.276 0.197 0.070 0.061]
		this is in times square - literally , in the square .
		[0.010 0.040 0.093 0.373 0.484]
		it is so crowded and it just felt like anyone could walk right in .
		[0.055 0.115 0.177 0.312 0.341]
		the room we stayed in had only one deadbolt and no chain - and although it 's a nice place , i found that strange .
		[0.164 0.213 0.232 0.178 0.212]
		there are two doors to enter the hotel , and no one opened them for us , ever . when we checked in , the clerk offered to upgrade us from a full size room to a queen , noting that we had requested fragrance and feather - free .
		[0.283 0.262 0.225 0.113 0.117]
		although he offered to upgrade , and we accepted , there was no upgrade : the room was actually a full size bed .
		[0.301 0.267 0.222 0.106 0.103]
		and alas , while clean and spacious for a nyc hotel room ( and i have stayed in many ) reeked of sausage when we first opened the door .
		[0.108 0.174 0.216 0.221 0.280]
		each time we returned to the room , we were assaulted with the smells .
		[0.316 0.268 0.219 0.097 0.101]
		i attribute the odor to the window unit air conditioner and the proximity of restaurants .
		[0.156 0.205 0.223 0.245 0.170]
		when i first went down to ask to change the room , the clerk did not apologize , said there was no room to change us to , and handed me a can of air freshener .
		[0.412 0.276 0.191 0.062 0.059]
		i told him that we were trying to avoid chemicals , and that using air freshener would just make the room smell like chemicals and sausage .
		[0.442 0.275 0.180 0.053 0.050]
		even carnivores would be nauseated by clothing , hair , and bedding saturated with pork smells . the next day i told them again how unpleasant it was , and they told me that the manager was not there , but he would be .
		[0.396 0.278 0.194 0.067 0.065]
		finally , john the manager came in at 9 am , and suddently , magically , there was a room available .
		[0.265 0.257 0.234 0.122 0.121]
		he at first offered to reduce the room rate , but when he moved us into a suite , withdrew that offer .
		[0.406 0.272 0.194 0.068 0.060]
		the suite did not smell like sausage , but by the time we were in it , we were so grossed out , it was not worth it .
		[0.246 0.251 0.229 0.125 0.149]
		we regretted ever coming to the casablanca .
		[0.137 0.191 0.222 0.227 0.223]

		good for business travel ; worthless as a resort for a business traveler , this hotel has some things to offer , namely : nice beds and bathrooms , proximity to the airport , decent in - house restaurants , an air of quasi - luxury , and a passable bar/lounge .
		[0.070 0.134 0.186 0.314 0.295]

		[0.239 0.243 0.224 0.164 0.130]
		so even as a business hotel , it misses the mark . as a resort , i would love to have been in on the meeting which informed the planning and decisions behind this property .
		[0.127 0.184 0.214 0.247 0.229]

		[0.352 0.267 0.204 0.095 0.082]
		first - - why on earth would you situate a resort on the most inhospitably windy point on the entire island .
		[0.135 0.190 0.217 0.244 0.215]
		the wind is insufferable , strong , constant , and nagging .
		[0.139 0.194 0.219 0.248 0.201]
		it blows the dirt - like sand everywhere , and every chaise is coated to the point where they do not appear blue , but brown .
		[0.289 0.266 0.226 0.118 0.101]
		you ca not hear the person next to you , it 's so loud .

		i 'm surprised more reviews do not mention this .
		[0.183 0.225 0.234 0.184 0.174]
		it is very , very inhospitable , the windiness ( the staff told me the wind was typical ) .
		[0.093 0.156 0.201 0.272 0.278]
		another point about location - - remote from everything .
		[0.160 0.211 0.239 0.198 0.191]
		$50 bucks round trip to old san juan . if you are going to have a windy beach and pool area , for god 's sake , heat the pool .
		[0.111 0.179 0.220 0.233 0.257]
		i 'm here on a weekend that is jam - packed , and have seen 9-10 people use the frigid pool the entire time .
		[0.180 0.221 0.234 0.174 0.191]

		it 's not hot .
		[0.165 0.210 0.232 0.189 0.204]
		it 's filled with infants and screaming children .
		[0.141 0.197 0.220 0.239 0.203]
		why bother , really ? the gym has a lot of decent equipment packed into a regular - sized hotel room .
		[0.133 0.193 0.220 0.244 0.210]
		it 's unacceptable and pathetic .
		[0.089 0.163 0.213 0.289 0.245]
		if they moved the same exact equipment into a space three times the size , it would be decent and even good .
		[0.211 0.236 0.225 0.171 0.157]
		they should do away with the yoga studio ( and i do yoga every day , so i 'm not putting yoga down ) , and expand the gym facility or just do away with it altogether .

		[0.336 0.254 0.235 0.099 0.076]
		we had a very undercooked burger at the restaurant , we had to send it back and they charged us for 2 of them , since they had to cook it twice ( amazing ! ! )5.

		the pool area and beach and fully open to all locals , no restrictions .
		[0.270 0.257 0.228 0.124 0.122]

		[0.201 0.236 0.234 0.161 0.169]

		[0.149 0.199 0.219 0.230 0.203]

		[0.337 0.272 0.214 0.090 0.087]

		[0.121 0.173 0.252 0.253 0.201]
		on top of that , there was no authentic puerto rican twist , not even a local type restaurant , on the resort .

		[0.184 0.221 0.230 0.185 0.180]

		[0.254 0.249 0.221 0.165 0.111]

		[0.176 0.216 0.222 0.210 0.176]
		this was a big spring break week , too , so it was 100% capacity .
		[0.150 0.209 0.231 0.209 0.201]

		[0.073 0.136 0.187 0.295 0.308]

		[0.400 0.272 0.191 0.073 0.064]

		[0.144 0.197 0.217 0.233 0.209]
		service was friendly , which is fortunate since many restaurants automatically included a 20% gratuity on every bill .
		[0.200 0.236 0.238 0.175 0.151]
		also , there is lots of walking/traveling involved at this hotel .
		[0.056 0.116 0.173 0.317 0.339]
		the casitas are nice , set aside from the rest of the hotel .
		[0.060 0.127 0.188 0.287 0.338]
		but it is a walk to everything .
		[0.055 0.118 0.183 0.292 0.353]
		the hotel makes a big deal about the personal butler service that comes with the casitas .
		[0.105 0.172 0.212 0.265 0.246]
		we were told we would have a butler everyday .
		[0.384 0.273 0.194 0.082 0.067]

		[0.143 0.205 0.259 0.195 0.197]

		[0.123 0.183 0.214 0.271 0.209]
		but after a couple of days , he had 2 days off and we could not find anyone who was assigned to our casita .
		[0.293 0.259 0.214 0.128 0.107]
		we enjoyed the water park , although it is small .
		[0.031 0.083 0.151 0.339 0.396]
		it is at the bottom of the hill , accessible only by two small funiculars that travel up and down the cliff .
		[0.104 0.168 0.206 0.281 0.241]
		fun for the kids once or twice , but a drag when lots of folks are trying to go to the same place at the same time .
		[0.306 0.267 0.221 0.104 0.102]
		the waterpark itself has three slides , a lazy river and a shallow area for small children to play .
		[0.040 0.098 0.158 0.397 0.307]
		if your kids have been to other water parks , be sure to set their expectations fairly low .
		[0.276 0.258 0.219 0.128 0.118]
		it is certainly more fun than a traditional hotel pool , but it is not that great for a water park .
		[0.028 0.077 0.136 0.353 0.406]
		and not free .
		[0.069 0.133 0.195 0.281 0.323]
		the tickets are about $13 for kids and $20 for adults .
		[0.120 0.186 0.224 0.234 0.236]
		the beach is on a separate island .
		[0.029 0.079 0.141 0.362 0.390]
		to get there , you take a free ferry ride .
		[0.098 0.162 0.211 0.260 0.269]
		you can rent rafts , inner tubes and other fun things , but everything is overpriced .
		[0.052 0.112 0.169 0.333 0.334]

		[0.187 0.229 0.236 0.184 0.164]

		[0.105 0.173 0.216 0.233 0.274]
		and we could set our own schedule .
		[0.129 0.189 0.216 0.248 0.218]
		the rain forest was beautiful and the hiking was great for kids .
		[0.032 0.085 0.145 0.376 0.362]
		i highly recommend at least a 1/2 day there . we also went on a boat tour of the bioluminescent bay .
		[0.086 0.151 0.198 0.286 0.279]

		[0.180 0.218 0.264 0.179 0.159]

		[0.072 0.138 0.190 0.304 0.296]

		[0.344 0.277 0.216 0.099 0.064]
		we knew that we were going to pay resort prices for food so we were prepared .
		[0.324 0.266 0.218 0.100 0.093]
		however , the service in all of the restaurants , especially otello 's was beyond awful .
		[0.182 0.224 0.232 0.182 0.181]
		it took approximately 45 minutes for them to bring out a plate of chicken fingers .
		[0.432 0.278 0.185 0.063 0.042]

		[0.253 0.248 0.230 0.130 0.138]

		[0.101 0.167 0.208 0.285 0.239]
		the location is beautiful and the unit we stayed in was very nicely appointed .
		[0.018 0.059 0.117 0.388 0.418]
		having a kitchen was a huge plus for us since we were traveling with young children .
		[0.192 0.231 0.237 0.175 0.164]
		you should most definitely use the hotel service to purchase groceries upon your arrival or rent a car or taxi to go to the local supermarket ( about 5 minutes from the hotel ) , you will save money and be better fed .
		[0.141 0.200 0.219 0.213 0.227]
		there were , however , significant negatives to the hotel which would prevent us from returning :1.
		[0.098 0.162 0.203 0.308 0.228]
		it took an hour to get from our room to the beach at palomino island .
		[0.202 0.227 0.227 0.179 0.165]
		you have to take a golf cart to the main hotel , walk about 4 city blocks through parts of the hotel , take an elevator to the tram , wait on line for the tram , wait for the boat to arrive and then travel to the island .
		[0.109 0.171 0.209 0.268 0.242]
		no part of the trip was unpleasant but that is a considerable amount of time ( especiallyl with kids in tow ) and your entire day had to be planned around trying to get to the beach .2.
		[0.336 0.272 0.215 0.093 0.084]
		the hotel was extremely crowded ( not suprisingly ) because of the holiday and they seemed unprepared for the crowds .
		[0.145 0.196 0.218 0.226 0.216]
		by the time we arrived at the beach they ran out of chairs , we had to wait 1 hour to pick up our lunch at the only restaurant on the island , the ice cream parlor in the main hotel ran out of most flavors and one of the restaurants we ate in even ran out of napkins .
		[0.287 0.262 0.224 0.112 0.116]
		i think this also contributed to the fact that we received very poor customer service from the certain members of the hotel staff .3.
		[0.243 0.251 0.232 0.137 0.137]
		the hotel adds additional costs at every turn .
		[0.121 0.187 0.215 0.271 0.205]
		given the cost of our room per night they should not charge an additional fee ( $25 per day per guest ) to use the golden door spa .
		[0.180 0.219 0.226 0.204 0.170]
		similarly , the $25 per person fee they charged for cancelled dinner reservations in hotel restaurants detered us from making any reservations in advance .
		[0.374 0.275 0.203 0.079 0.069]
		this proved to be a wise choice because 2 of our children became sick during our visit and we would have spent $150 not to have dinner .

		[0.231 0.239 0.225 0.162 0.143]
		the second room they put us in was right next to the funicular railway , which , by the way , runs all night !
		[0.179 0.216 0.223 0.195 0.188]
		you 'd think that if you request to be moved due to noise in the first place , that they would not put you right next to something else that 's equally as annoying .
		[0.300 0.266 0.222 0.106 0.106]
		that room was also next to a family with who knows how many kids whose primary goal in life was to slam doors and yell loudly .
		[0.244 0.253 0.221 0.152 0.131]
		we requested another move and were put on the other side of that particular wing in another ocean view room .
		[0.246 0.251 0.224 0.146 0.134]
		this time , we were not near anything noisy , and this room 's view far exceeded that of the first two .
		[0.111 0.171 0.208 0.255 0.254]
		clearly , the rooms here are not created equally .
		[0.176 0.222 0.226 0.208 0.168]
		speak up and get a nice one !
		[0.278 0.257 0.249 0.112 0.104]
		the bed in the ocean view room was really comfortable , but forget about the l shaped vinyl couch .
		[0.110 0.177 0.219 0.233 0.261]
		whoever came up with that idea should be fired .
		[0.518 0.243 0.174 0.040 0.025]
		overall we found the staff very pleasant , helpful , and accommodating .
		[0.017 0.055 0.112 0.381 0.435]
		we tried to sign up for a couple of the tours , but unless the hotel has enough people signed up , they wo not run them , which was disappointing .
		[0.294 0.265 0.224 0.110 0.107]
		luckily , we decided to rent a car for a day and go out on our own .
		[0.158 0.198 0.256 0.196 0.192]
		the rentals are cheap ( there 's an enterprise desk right next to the concierge ) , and this was the best decision we could have made .
		[0.100 0.162 0.203 0.275 0.259]
		a car offers infinitely more freedom on this island ( i did not see any public trans ) , and since this hotel is literally on top of a huge hill and far away from san juan , it 's the only way to escape - for example - to eat somewhere local and reasonably priced ( try el pasion if you 're looking for a good nearby restaurant ) .
		[0.048 0.106 0.165 0.345 0.336]
		with four people , we spent nearly half as much on the car/gas as we would have doing the hotel 's tours .
		[0.129 0.184 0.216 0.243 0.228]
		we also saw double the amount of attractions .
		[0.121 0.183 0.215 0.267 0.213]
		the most annoying thing about this place is that the beach is on an island and you have to take a boat out there to get to it .
		[0.157 0.203 0.222 0.212 0.208]
		we did not even bother doing this due to our schedule .
		[0.494 0.270 0.161 0.042 0.033]
		the last boat out there leaves at 3 pm and the last boat back to the hotel leaves at 5 pm .
		[0.217 0.243 0.233 0.153 0.153]
		at other hotels we visited during our business meeting , a beach was no more than a 2 minute walk from the hotel lobby ( e . g .
		[0.054 0.115 0.165 0.330 0.336]
		rio mar hotel near el yunque rainforest - as an aside , we swam at the beach here around 4 pm and it was amazing ) .
		[0.114 0.182 0.224 0.239 0.241]
		at el con , i guess you are just out of luck if you want to have a beer on the sand after 5 pm !
		[0.247 0.251 0.231 0.135 0.136]
		the pools are open 24 hours , though , but during the day were crowded to the point where i would not even really consider using them .
		[0.220 0.240 0.227 0.160 0.154]
		i wondered if half the people using them were even staying at the resort . the sting ray cafe offered delicious fine dining for around $50 a person not including drinks .
		[0.194 0.223 0.227 0.193 0.163]
		the other restaurants were overpriced and were acceptable otherwise .
		[0.242 0.248 0.224 0.155 0.131]
		i believe it 's much better to go into fajardo and find a local place instead .
		[0.112 0.173 0.211 0.263 0.242]
		overall , the place has amazing views .
		[0.025 0.073 0.138 0.368 0.397]
		it 's probably better for families than it is for couples .
		[0.054 0.118 0.182 0.304 0.342]
		if you want beach access without a huge hassle , do not stay here .
		[0.149 0.205 0.230 0.198 0.217]
		also , this place is better for those who do not want to travel around the island - those looking for the resort experience only .
		[0.191 0.223 0.231 0.178 0.177]
		the golf course looked great , too , although scorched in some parts .
		[0.055 0.117 0.174 0.324 0.330]
		also , the casino was a lot of fun , but for anyone who likes video poker , the pay table are awful (6/5 jacks or better ) .my advice would be to stay somewhere more centralized and wherever you stay , rent a car !

		[0.184 0.222 0.224 0.214 0.156]
		i gave a buffet reception where they could only provide 4 plastic containers to have guests take leftover food back to their apartments ; claimed they were all out thus i had a lot of dissapointed guests and expensive food waisted .
		[0.362 0.276 0.206 0.080 0.076]
		3) poor service , tray set outside for three days before being picked up , extra towels took a day since they had to get it from the main building , we never got the coffee for our coffee maker the entire week , had to ask for new soap several times . . . etc .4) paid

		[0.470 0.272 0.173 0.047 0.039]
		when the staff member finally showed up , he had the nerve to tell me oh , do not worry the use of the wheelchair right now is free , but if you need it any other time it will be $25 a day are you kidding me ? ? first of all . . . .over something that happened at your resort , and the complete nerve of them to take advantage of people in that since is outrageous .

		[0.192 0.224 0.225 0.208 0.151]
		the penny slots are on the edge of the casino alongside the lobby , so you must pass by them to get to other places . if you decide to go anyway , make sure to go to the small infinity pool at the casitas - there 's a sign that it 's only for guests at the casitas , but they do not mind .
		[0.152 0.200 0.220 0.232 0.195]

		a letter to my travel agent : tell customers to skip pr and elcon hi paulette , after enjoying old san juan for a day , i went to the el conquistador and i was really disappointed .
		[0.174 0.215 0.222 0.216 0.173]

		so knowing that my temper and frustration level would rise quickly , no matter how much i tried to make the best of things at el con , i left pr after one day for saint thomas and st john where i spent an enjoyable three days at the westin hotel , a great place , thats extremely well designed , and run .

		overrated and overpriced just got back from six days in puerto rico .
		[0.195 0.212 0.264 0.187 0.141]
		the el conquistador did not meet our expectations in terms of their rooms and amenities .
		[0.111 0.173 0.211 0.277 0.228]
		so if you are expecting luxurious rooms - read on . . . we were booked for five nights but ended up staying only three . . . switched to the westin in rio grande which i highly recommend - they 've just been through an extensive renovation .
		[0.111 0.172 0.209 0.274 0.234]
		( this is something the elcon will be doing but it will take a few years - it used to be a wyndham resort - and was just bought by blackstone real estate group ) .the elcon did not tell us that mid - way through our stay that they had booked a huge broadcasting convention - and that wbls radio station ( in ny ) would be broadcasting shows and blaring music until 12:30-1am right outside our window for a few nights !
		[0.148 0.199 0.218 0.229 0.207]
		the whole point of the trip is that we had wanted to escape new york city and all its sounds .
		[0.063 0.126 0.182 0.323 0.306]
		when we first got to the resort - we ended up switching rooms 3 times ( something i 've never done ) but worth the effort .
		[0.336 0.273 0.213 0.091 0.088]
		first two rooms had broken lamps and shower rods and the bathrooms had dirty floors and showers with mildew stains on tiles and curtains .
		[0.199 0.240 0.231 0.180 0.150]
		the third room was in la vista area/wing of resort ( near spa ) -had a great view of palomino island but no amenities of any kind .
		[0.041 0.097 0.158 0.353 0.351]
		no bathrobes or turn down service and the beds honestly felt like cots .
		[0.349 0.276 0.221 0.086 0.068]
		at $359 a night for an ocean view room - i would definitely like amenities !
		[0.067 0.130 0.185 0.280 0.339]
		( also - very important , that does not include the extra $89.75 in resort tax and tariff fees they bill you at the end !
		[0.190 0.228 0.223 0.183 0.176]
		comes out to a whopping $448.75 a night .
		[0.217 0.224 0.251 0.153 0.155]
		for that you get a great view w/terrace - but not a great room .
		[0.039 0.094 0.160 0.313 0.394]
		food left little to be desired - very over priced and not that good overall .
		[0.196 0.231 0.238 0.166 0.170]
		ok , there are the negatives - here are the positives : palomino island - private island with breathtaking views and good beach ( free ferry shuttle from resort ) .
		[0.047 0.106 0.167 0.359 0.321]
		golf - excellent arthur hills golf course ( again very expensive for a round and rented clubs - and i think you should get at least free bottled water - which you do not ) but one of the most beautiful courses i 've ever played .
		[0.138 0.201 0.231 0.209 0.221]
		stingray restaurant ( down in marina area ) -expensive but worth it : great food , great atmosphere and view .
		[0.024 0.066 0.151 0.356 0.403]
		golden door spa - my friend said the deep tissue massage was intense and that they had a relaxing waterfall hot tub in the indoor spa area .
		[0.215 0.245 0.243 0.162 0.134]
		rainforest day tour ( not hiking one ) -get edwin as your tour guide and have a fun , lively trip ( roughly $99 for two people ) .
		[0.139 0.203 0.238 0.216 0.205]
		oh , one note - the elcon bioluminescence kayaking tour at night ( $133 for two people ) -is the one at laguna grande not vieques .
		[0.232 0.249 0.240 0.148 0.131]
		most of your time is spent paddling through the mangrove trees to get to the bay in complete darkness - and its rather difficult paddling against the current going back .
		[0.254 0.257 0.230 0.137 0.122]
		not for first time kayakers at all .
		[0.244 0.243 0.231 0.138 0.144]
		we own kayaks and found this trip challenging ( mostly because it was very difficult to see anything in the pitch black ) .
		[0.119 0.180 0.212 0.276 0.212]
		also , the time spent at the bioluminescence bay itself is roughly ten minutes .
		[0.118 0.182 0.212 0.250 0.238]
		very cool once you 're there to see the water light up around you .
		[0.161 0.206 0.225 0.215 0.192]
		the trip to vieques is the one most often highlighted in tour books but i do not believe the elcon offers that particular trip - or at least they did not when we were there .
		[0.194 0.225 0.223 0.193 0.165]
		ok - back to the positives : definitely go to the infinity pool by the casitas village at the resort .
		[0.200 0.226 0.225 0.197 0.153]
		go out to eat in fajardo - -either to lolita 's ( good mexican restaurant in fajardo/luquillos area ) or passyons ( great local spot with authentic pr cuisine nearby ) .
		[0.065 0.129 0.183 0.338 0.284]
		also , check out the elcon web site - as they do have promotions available with certain bookings that will save some money in the long run . . . but if you want to save $120 a night - i personally think the westin is the way to go .
		[0.138 0.192 0.217 0.246 0.207]
		it has ocean view rooms w/terraces - a private mile stretch of beach ( right off resort - no ferry service ) good room amenities ( westin heavenly beds and robes ) -2 golf courses ( rio mar cc ) and like elcon they had many different restaurants and a casino at the hotel .
		[0.122 0.189 0.225 0.224 0.239]
		also - there were no extra room tax and tariff rates and the rate included breakfast ( comparable if not better than the $50 buffet breakfast for two you got at elcon ) .
		[0.163 0.216 0.232 0.192 0.197]
		again , skip some of the restaurants at the westin ( palio was over priced and had just ok food ) and go to ones outside the resort .
		[0.180 0.217 0.223 0.202 0.178]
		we went to antojito 's ( right outside resort and down hill to the left ) -good local spot - w/good food - mofangos - reasonable and very friendly staff .
		[0.058 0.118 0.176 0.315 0.333]
		one downside of the resort is that their shuttle service to the golf area or tennis area was not reliable - no one seemed too concerned to get us to our tee time in time .
		[0.308 0.269 0.222 0.102 0.100]
		but at the westin you have breathtaking views of the rainforest and good views of the atlantic ocean and you are that much closer to old san juan if you want to take a day ( or night ) trip there .
		[0.065 0.128 0.183 0.320 0.304]

		[0.122 0.180 0.215 0.253 0.230]
		we decided on the resort also because most of the nicer resorts in san juan were booked . when we arrived early friday afternoon in puerto rico we were excited to see a bus awaiting to sweep us away to our carribbean resort .
		[0.284 0.263 0.225 0.112 0.116]
		we waited for approximately 45 minutes before our bus ride left the airport .

		[0.311 0.265 0.212 0.120 0.093]

		[0.225 0.245 0.233 0.144 0.153]
		upon arrival and check - in we were a little exhausted by the trip on the bus and then navigating around the resort and finally reaching our room .
		[0.291 0.264 0.227 0.106 0.112]
		the staff seemed very pleasant at the check - in desk and the bellhop was very helpful and delightful .
		[0.032 0.083 0.143 0.363 0.379]

		[0.255 0.257 0.233 0.138 0.117]
		we dined at the stingray cafe and the fish entrees we had were delicious and the service was beyond amazing ! we were warm and muggy much of the time during the night , the air would not adjust to cooler .
		[0.188 0.231 0.239 0.171 0.173]

		saturday we rode the ferry over to the palomino island .
		[0.127 0.181 0.251 0.241 0.200]
		we hiked the entire island and we were a little disppointed in the majority of the island .
		[0.114 0.179 0.220 0.220 0.267]
		over much of the terrain near the populated beach it looked as though they were in the process of landscaping because there were tractor/bulldozer tracks .
		[0.236 0.241 0.222 0.156 0.144]
		we ate lunch at the outdoor iguana 's cafe and were a little preturbed at the constant pestering the roaming chickens gave us .
		[0.161 0.213 0.222 0.213 0.191]
		the food was average for cafe food .
		[0.128 0.185 0.221 0.235 0.231]
		the water at the main beach area and the surrounding ocean scenery was quite peaceful and beautiful .
		[0.101 0.170 0.213 0.255 0.261]
		the ferry ride to and from makes for a fun trip but slightly annoying when you think about it - why not just have a beach right at the resort area ?
		[0.116 0.178 0.213 0.238 0.255]
		also , the palomino island is apparently not a private beach but rather has quite a crowd of locals with loud music and large boats anchored right at the ferry drop off area .
		[0.075 0.144 0.204 0.293 0.285]
		we did not elect to do the horse back riding - i 'm not sure where all you could have ridden the horses , after scoping out the island it seems as though you would have had a medicore dirt trail ride with a short time on the beachfront .
		[0.209 0.230 0.223 0.185 0.153]
		we had some appetizer foods mid - afternoon at the bally - hoo bar and grill , food was good and the nice flat screen t . v . 's were nice for viewing the basketball games .
		[0.132 0.192 0.217 0.237 0.222]
		we ate at blossoms that night and the food was good , pricey though . we elected for room service for breakfast and the food was average but the price was a bit much .
		[0.056 0.116 0.172 0.321 0.335]
		the food was fresh but you could tell the long journey from the main resort area to our room mid - way down to the ocean was a long and tolling journey .
		[0.147 0.198 0.219 0.233 0.204]
		we returned back to the palomino island and enjoyed another day in the sun !
		[0.130 0.186 0.218 0.243 0.223]
		one of the definite highlights was the beautiful weather all four days we were there . the pool areas were average , although at the end of the day they looked pretty well beaten .
		[0.190 0.228 0.223 0.177 0.182]

		[0.217 0.246 0.236 0.164 0.137]

		based on reviews here , the location and the amenities offered , i honestly would not have selected this resort and after a 1 week stay , i would not recommend this resort to others . first things first , many people have stated and people still seem to be surprised so i will repeat it , the resort is a 30 minute drive from san juan and it can take up to 1 hour if there is traffic .

		[0.174 0.220 0.221 0.185 0.201]
		service at every restaurant visited was sometimes friendly and consistently bad , with the exception of the grill room , which did have pretty good service but the food was mediocre at best , and was way over - priced . in general , the worst thing about the hotel is that the food is not good and it 's not cheap .

(and i hate to say it , but it was noisy ) but the list is ever so long of things that ticked us off : rude management at the pool , unprofessional staff in general , late house - keeping service , embarrasingly bad wine lists , over - crowded , noisy , noisy , noisy , loud - speakers at the pool along with really bad music , dirty public restrooms , rude hostesses , a shower that has low pressure and is often cold , the hotel has that club - med kind of cheezy , trying to be fancy but not quite cutting it feel ( and the clientel to go with it ) . . .if the westin is going in this direction , they better cut the prices and change their name ! these may sound like petty complaints but at those prices , i do not wish to feel like i am part of a cattle herd ! !if you are looking for serene or elegant , do not bother . if you are looking for fine cuisine and excellent service , do not go to the westin rio mar ! if you are expecting to find your needs anticipated and to feel pampered and special , go elsewhere ! !in essence , it seems their goal is to herd in as many people as possible and get them to spend as much as possible .
		[0.222 0.245 0.235 0.145 0.153]
		it is a reactive - service oriented hotel , where complaining gets you upgrades , comped meals , etc but there is no apparent effort whatsoever to make things luxurious or wonderful for the guests without the guests specifically complaining about things ! i would never return to the westin rio mar and discerning guests are advised to avoid it if at all possible ! with 2 small children , all i wanted was to feel pampered and relaxed and really taken care of ( especially when spending thousands and thousands of dollars ) but what i got was stress and waiting and insults and chasing pool servers !

		this hotel is a 5 star ( suposidly ) but i was extremely dissappointed with many aspects .1.
		[0.083 0.148 0.195 0.303 0.270]
		no one spoke english ! ! ! thank goodness we learned how to say milk and beer in spanish otherwise we would have never gotten anything .
		[0.497 0.270 0.157 0.044 0.032]
		2. i brought my 2 1/2 year old daughter because they advertise this to be a family resort yet the kids club was always closed and when it was open ( maybe once ) there was no one there that spoke english tha i would safe leaving my daughter with .
		[0.346 0.276 0.218 0.086 0.075]
		there were no other children there so we opted to swim in the pool .
		[0.264 0.250 0.219 0.143 0.124]
		3. i have stayed at sandals , couples , swept away and even the holiday inn sunspree resort and i would consider this a 1 star in comparison to all of those .
		[0.265 0.259 0.232 0.128 0.117]
		there were no activities organized by the staff , it was an entertain yourself kind of place .
		[0.196 0.231 0.230 0.166 0.177]

		[0.204 0.236 0.233 0.164 0.163]
		4. the resort had horseback riding and my daughter loves horses so we wanted to take her .
		[0.428 0.279 0.191 0.062 0.040]
		well , of course they did not offer it on certain days and told me to go check out the adult horseback riding session .
		[0.402 0.276 0.188 0.072 0.063]
		they told me that i can take my daughter on that and hold her .
		[0.528 0.259 0.146 0.037 0.030]
		so then we went to make the resevations for the adult one and again i asked to make sure that i can take my daughter and hold her . . . they confirmed with out a doubt that i can .
		[0.337 0.272 0.212 0.089 0.090]
		after the bus came , picked us up and drove us for about 1/2 hour to the horseback riding place and after waiting 10 minutes the instructor then tells me that i ca not take my daughter because i 'm not a professional horse back rider .
		[0.326 0.265 0.207 0.115 0.086]
		i threw a fit and after all of it he agreed to have the guide take my daughter , that was the nicest part of the trip .5.
		[0.367 0.275 0.209 0.082 0.067]
		restaurants were closed often and they all seemed to open on the last night we were there .
		[0.299 0.262 0.219 0.111 0.109]
		food was ok , the best was the seafood where we had lobster on the beachfront rest .
		[0.243 0.245 0.222 0.159 0.130]
		steak in the one was undercooked and we could not go back to try another night because it was closed .
		[0.337 0.257 0.225 0.093 0.087]
		also , for picky kids be prepared to pay for the kids while having them eat fries for 7 days . . . kids menu was horrible , maybe because there was none .
		[0.274 0.260 0.228 0.123 0.115]
		overall i would not go back to this place nor would i recommend it to anyone .
		[0.311 0.266 0.220 0.101 0.103]
		i have stayed at 5 star resorts and besides the scenery around the grounds , the parrot zoo i have to say i was very dissappointed with this resort .

		[0.128 0.190 0.225 0.209 0.248]

		[0.316 0.263 0.211 0.123 0.087]
		i guess i was wrong . the food was ok . . . big variety , but not the greatest quality .
		[0.166 0.211 0.222 0.212 0.189]
		if you have small kids you might have a problem with food .
		[0.119 0.177 0.217 0.241 0.246]
		the only things are the cereal and yogurt , but how many days your kid can eat that .
		[0.106 0.169 0.208 0.279 0.239]
		if you want to get reservation to french or japanese restaurant you must do it right away when you arrive .

		we tried to do it next day , there was nothing available for the whole week .
		[0.320 0.263 0.216 0.105 0.097]
		at last , the day we were leaving , the bellboy service did not pick us up at the right time , we called the service three times , but they screwed up and our bus to airport left without us .
		[0.346 0.270 0.211 0.086 0.087]
		when we asked at the front desk how we are going to get to the airport , they said we have to take taxi and pay for it ourselves .
		[0.338 0.266 0.208 0.101 0.088]
		of course , we had to fight for that since it was totally their fault .
		[0.338 0.274 0.213 0.091 0.083]
		finally , they agreed and gave us a ride to the airport for free .
		[0.312 0.266 0.226 0.104 0.092]
		at last , we were tired and aggravated .
		[0.276 0.257 0.227 0.119 0.121]

		[0.379 0.275 0.203 0.079 0.065]
		the room they assigned us was picture perfect .
		[0.355 0.275 0.210 0.089 0.071]
		it was a caribbean style junior suite right next to the pool and the beach .
		[0.151 0.205 0.223 0.206 0.215]
		i was within steps away from all the major restaurants and attractions .
		[0.077 0.141 0.193 0.308 0.281]
		once we got settled in we began noticing a few details that were minor at the time .
		[0.318 0.269 0.222 0.106 0.085]
		no toilet paper , no fresh towels etc .
		[0.236 0.248 0.227 0.171 0.119]

		[0.314 0.268 0.219 0.103 0.096]

		when you try and ask for a manager , no one seems to know the organizational flow .
		[0.291 0.257 0.219 0.121 0.112]
		another hassle was the lack of towels being offered .
		[0.415 0.277 0.201 0.061 0.046]
		they would run out of towels everyday , and you must keep them with you at all times .
		[0.291 0.261 0.225 0.113 0.110]
		i , as well as one of our friends got locked out of our rooms for quite some time .

		we had to physically walk to the lobby and demand a new key that was functional .
		[0.123 0.183 0.214 0.270 0.210]
		make sure you take everything you will need . . . .the boutique is a rip off .
		[0.184 0.225 0.233 0.173 0.185]
		they were selling regular wal - mart beach bags for $64 usd not pesos , a chap stick cost me almost $5 usd .

		[0.144 0.197 0.233 0.209 0.218]
		i really enjoyed the walks through the mangros . the beach is one of the best i have ever seen .
		[0.114 0.173 0.210 0.256 0.247]

		[0.057 0.119 0.186 0.301 0.337]
		however , a person needs toeat and this is where things change .
		[0.162 0.211 0.231 0.198 0.198]
		the food in the buffet area isalways served cold .
		[0.207 0.233 0.230 0.167 0.163]
		this fault lies squarely on the head chef 's shoulders .
		[0.191 0.233 0.234 0.186 0.156]
		i really think it is a disgrace that a chef would allow food to be served cold !
		[0.293 0.265 0.224 0.116 0.100]
		there are no steamers under the pans . i went to eat when the doors opened every day so i know the food had to have been layed out some time earlier .

		[0.310 0.269 0.219 0.108 0.094]

		[0.219 0.236 0.232 0.151 0.162]

		if you 're a non - smoker - stay away from his one ! ! just returned from a one - week stay at the bavaro princess and was very , very disappointed .
		[0.176 0.218 0.232 0.177 0.197]
		the resort bills itself as 5- star facility but barely makes 2 - and i give those 2 stars for the lush tropical landscaping .
		[0.327 0.274 0.217 0.103 0.079]
		this is a resort for smokers and/or people who have never been to a real 5- star resort ( or a 4- star or 3- star for that matter ) , and/or people with super - low expectations about their accomodations , food , and service . let me begin with what was good about the hotel : 1) lush tropical landscaping that is very well maintained .
		[0.241 0.250 0.221 0.145 0.142]
		wehn you go to a caribbean resort , this is what you want the grounds to look like .
		[0.288 0.259 0.224 0.114 0.116]

		large rooms .4)
		[0.015 0.054 0.112 0.449 0.369]
		nice , large , comfortable casino on the property which was empty on each of our two visits .
		[0.111 0.178 0.221 0.232 0.258]
		i would recommend a visit to the casino if only to take an air break as it seemed to be the only place in the entire resort with truly cold a/c .
		[0.163 0.208 0.225 0.210 0.194]
		a veteran of the bp told us the reason the casino was so empty is because the slots do not pay and he felt even the games were rigged .
		[0.284 0.255 0.217 0.136 0.108]
		he pointed out that there is little oversight of casinos in the dominican republic and certainly not the sort of regulation applied to casinos in the us .
		[0.391 0.276 0.200 0.073 0.061]
		i do not know about all that as we are not big gamblers .
		[0.306 0.260 0.221 0.105 0.107]
		we enjoyed our two hours of cool air at the casino .5)
		[0.097 0.161 0.204 0.294 0.244]
		friendly staff : most of the staff we dealt with were very friendly and helpful . why i would never go back to the bavaro princess :1) if you 're a non - smoker , as i am , keep away from this place .
		[0.147 0.196 0.218 0.221 0.218]
		smoking is not only permitted everywhere , it seems to almost be encouraged .
		[0.300 0.270 0.230 0.110 0.091]
		people smoke in the main dining room , in the restaurants , at the pool , in the pool , at the beach , in the water at the beach , on the trams , in the theater , and in their rooms .
		[0.181 0.223 0.236 0.167 0.193]
		there are no non - smoking rooms or public areas at this resort so a non - smoker is subjected to the disgusting stink of cigarettes virtually everywhere .
		[0.217 0.242 0.226 0.162 0.153]
		smokers think nothing of flicking their cigatettes anywhere they wish including on walkways , at the beach , in the pool area and from moving trams .
		[0.273 0.240 0.256 0.129 0.102]
		rooms are sectioned four to a building ( two up and two down ) and seem to share the air conditioning .
		[0.185 0.225 0.234 0.173 0.184]
		if you have a neighbor who smokes , the stink will be in your room as well .
		[0.206 0.237 0.233 0.153 0.172]
		there is no escaping cigartette smoke here .2)
		[0.079 0.145 0.194 0.315 0.268]
		i do not expect a whole heck of a lot when i go to a resort but i do expect air conditioning that works ( especially in a place where the temperture was routinely in the 80s -90s fahrenheit and the humidity was high to match ) .
		[0.229 0.246 0.233 0.137 0.155]
		the a/c in the rooms was marginal at best .
		[0.228 0.245 0.235 0.149 0.143]
		there is no such thing as 'cold ' air - the best you can hope for is 'cooler than outside . '
		[0.080 0.144 0.198 0.292 0.286]
		the main dining room , which is where you will do most of your eating , is an enormous building open at the sides with no air conditioning .
		[0.211 0.240 0.234 0.155 0.160]
		meals were sweat - fests .
		[0.353 0.274 0.215 0.093 0.065]
		a handful of restaurants on the property did have a/c but there , too , it was only enough to be better than outside .
		[0.166 0.213 0.231 0.180 0.211]
		if cold a/c is something you need to have a comfortable stay in a hot tropical locale , this is not the place for you .3)
		[0.130 0.184 0.216 0.250 0.220]
		when i travel , i also expect a comfortable place to sleep .
		[0.191 0.224 0.235 0.172 0.177]
		again , the rooms are large , but the lack of cold a/c and beds that were like sleeping on ironing boards made our stay very uncomfortable .
		[0.104 0.166 0.207 0.273 0.250]
		choice of beds is what they refer to as a twin ( smaller than what a twin would be in the us ) or a king ( more like a small us queen - size ) .
		[0.135 0.195 0.228 0.208 0.234]
		my 6'1 frame did not do well on the 3x6 'twin ' that was basically the size of an army cot but not nearly as comfortable .4)
		[0.146 0.197 0.220 0.242 0.194]
		this resort is spanish - owned .
		[0.373 0.277 0.203 0.079 0.068]
		do not expect us - type service nor employees who speak fluent english .
		[0.457 0.274 0.169 0.060 0.040]
		i speak spanish so it was not much of a problem for me , but i heard a number of american guests complain that they had problems being understood especially when it came to problems with their rooms or service .
		[0.337 0.272 0.212 0.088 0.090]
		the clientelle when we were there was largely spanish , argentinian , dominican , and russian with americans probably 5th in number followed by some german and french .
		[0.241 0.254 0.231 0.139 0.135]
		5) blankets provided were threadbare in spots and most of the towels we received during our stay were worn and frayed at the edges and should have been retired long ago .
		[0.256 0.249 0.221 0.158 0.117]
		there 's no excuse for worn - out blankets and towels .6)
		[0.145 0.200 0.221 0.262 0.173]
		when we arrived ( late - at about 10pm ) at our room , there was a slow leak in the line that runs from the wall into the toilet , spreading a line of water across the slick bathroom floor .
		[0.233 0.248 0.231 0.141 0.147]
		after almost breaking my neck slipping on the water , i called guest services .
		[0.467 0.273 0.172 0.047 0.040]
		the person who answered said that they were alone and that they would not be able to send a service person out until the next day .
		[0.438 0.270 0.177 0.065 0.050]
		the following day it took 3 calls over a four - hour period to get someone out to fix the leak .
		[0.498 0.269 0.161 0.042 0.030]
		the remote control for the tv did not work and a check revealed there were no batteries in it ; once turned on , the panel controls on the tv did not work and we could not turn the tv off .
		[0.252 0.252 0.221 0.135 0.140]
		we had to yank the plug to get it off and getting batteries for the remote and a tech to repair ( or replace ) the tv took the same 3 phone calls and 2 days .
		[0.344 0.274 0.212 0.089 0.081]
		when we returned to our room later that evening ( after a day at the beach and before dinner ) we found a half - drunk bottle of coke on a counter and one of the bottles of water in the fridge had been opened , partially drunk , and put back .
		[0.284 0.263 0.226 0.113 0.114]
		not exactly a 5- star hotel .7)
		[0.131 0.188 0.217 0.268 0.197]
		there are hokey shows in the theater each evening .
		[0.075 0.141 0.192 0.305 0.288]
		if you are expecting las vegas - style entertainment ( or even cruise - ship quality entertainment ) , this is not for you .
		[0.120 0.182 0.212 0.261 0.224]
		the theater is in the same building as the main dining room .
		[0.079 0.144 0.194 0.300 0.283]
		it also lacks a/c and was a smoke - filled , sweat box .
		[0.121 0.189 0.216 0.267 0.206]
		8) trams are necessary for all but the most hearty to navigate the resort .
		[0.136 0.191 0.217 0.238 0.217]
		our room was at the far end , away from the beach .
		[0.220 0.236 0.234 0.153 0.157]
		trams supposedly run 24 hours a day .
		[0.401 0.264 0.212 0.076 0.046]
		we found it nearly impossible to get a tram at the peak dinner hours and wound up walking to the dining room each evening .
		[0.261 0.259 0.230 0.133 0.118]
		again , bear in mind that people think nothing of smoking on these often - crowded trams ( and not a day went by that we did not see someone flicking their lit cigarette into the bushes from a moving tram ) .9)
		[0.186 0.220 0.223 0.212 0.159]
		there are two nice - sized pools on the property .
		[0.050 0.110 0.170 0.320 0.351]
		the main pool is close to the beach .
		[0.154 0.202 0.230 0.203 0.211]
		plenty of chairs and free pool towels are provided .
		[0.062 0.127 0.193 0.306 0.313]
		the main pool has a bar located inisde it that you can swim up to and order free beverages .
		[0.075 0.140 0.190 0.297 0.298]
		resort newbies seem to really like this feature .
		[0.208 0.231 0.225 0.184 0.153]
		the water temperture when we were there made the pool feel like a hot bath , which people seemed to enjoy ( i preferred the ocean ) .
		[0.199 0.232 0.232 0.157 0.179]
		what 's bad about the pool : there are no restrictions on children being in the pool .
		[0.264 0.251 0.228 0.124 0.132]
		we saw people with infants in pampers and were close - by at least one incident where a baby actually defacated into the pool .
		[0.271 0.259 0.229 0.119 0.122]
		as noted above , people smoke in the pool , putting their cigarettes out wherever it is most convenient for them anywhere nearby .
		[0.123 0.183 0.214 0.273 0.207]
		with its super warm temperature , many children and infants and many inconsiderate smokers , i found the pool unsanitary and not a place i would want to hang out and certainly not a place for kids to spend the day unless they 've had all their shots .10)
		[0.205 0.235 0.223 0.164 0.173]
		and speaking of kids - a note to americans thinking of bringing their children here : as this resort caters largely to europeans and south americans , a number of women were topless on the beach .
		[0.289 0.265 0.216 0.130 0.100]
		this seemed to be a big plus for the many 20- somethings vacationing from the usa but seemed to come as a surprise to americans there with their kids who found themselves doing some explaining they might not have expected .
		[0.166 0.210 0.221 0.217 0.186]
		10) food was a major disappointment .
		[0.230 0.243 0.229 0.158 0.140]
		most of your eating will be done in the large main dining room .
		[0.146 0.202 0.232 0.209 0.211]
		it is buffet - style and , as previously noted , it is a sweaty free - for - all .
		[0.068 0.135 0.186 0.277 0.334]
		while the buffet offered a wide selection of food , varied by theme each night , the food was mediocre at best .
		[0.229 0.239 0.224 0.177 0.131]
		the 'hot ' food was not placed on burners or under heat lamps and was cold for all but the first to get at it .
		[0.258 0.257 0.228 0.124 0.133]
		the cold food was not placed on ice or in refrigerated units so it was luke - warm by the time anyone who came later on in the meal got to it .
		[0.248 0.255 0.230 0.131 0.136]
		two of the restaurants we ate at did a good job with their meals : one was the japanese restaurant where guests sit benihana - style around a common table with the chef cooking in the center .
		[0.171 0.219 0.223 0.195 0.193]
		the chef was entertaining and the food was good .
		[0.061 0.125 0.180 0.332 0.302]
		the argentinian restaurant el gaucho did poorly on service but a good job with our argentinian steaks .
		[0.196 0.234 0.236 0.169 0.165]
		el gaucho is not air coniditioned .
		[0.278 0.252 0.224 0.129 0.118]
		for some bizarre reason , men are required to wear long pants to the restaurants which would be fine if they had adequate a/c .
		[0.263 0.260 0.228 0.128 0.120]
		el gaucho had none and the rest had only 'cool ' air at best .
		[0.298 0.257 0.220 0.117 0.109]
		women can come dressed as they wish , and many did .
		[0.309 0.270 0.228 0.108 0.086]
		so you men sweating in long pants sitting across from women in shorts .
		[0.375 0.277 0.199 0.094 0.055]
		go figure .
		[0.536 0.259 0.150 0.036 0.020]
		11) mangrove and zoo : the resort had , to its credit , preserved a natural mangrove area that is accessible by a short walking trail .
		[0.164 0.219 0.238 0.204 0.174]
		it is a nice touch and is great for the kids who get to see turtles and fish from the trail .
		[0.045 0.103 0.161 0.332 0.358]
		unfortunately the resort feels it necessary to keep a small 'zoo ' along the trail with a handful of cages housing birds and one for iguanas .
		[0.096 0.160 0.203 0.302 0.239]
		the enclosure for the vulture was way too small and none of the cages had clean water for the animals when we passed through - yes - we looked .
		[0.216 0.240 0.234 0.149 0.160]
		there is no security and while we were walking through some [ - - - - - - - ] and his rotten kids were throwing bread at the caged vulture which was obviously distressed by the harrassment .
		[0.228 0.242 0.223 0.156 0.150]
		the large iguana enlcosure had no foliage , shade or clean water when we passed by .
		[0.272 0.259 0.225 0.127 0.117]
		cruelty to animals is very unappealing to most americans .
		[0.299 0.267 0.224 0.111 0.099]
		the resort should do away with the zoo and just have the natural mangrove trail .
		[0.161 0.210 0.223 0.240 0.167]
		it is pretty enough without mistreating any birds or other animals .
		[0.213 0.241 0.237 0.164 0.144]
		conclusion : nice tropical setting , beautiful landscaping ; nice beach ; big rooms ; mostly nice , friendly staff .
		[0.068 0.128 0.222 0.307 0.275]
		bad a/c , bad beds , unsanitary pool , smokers and smoking everywhere , poor food .
		[0.465 0.272 0.175 0.050 0.037]
		as i said in the beginning : this is a resort for smokers and/or people who have never been to a real 5- star resort ( or a 4- star or 3- star for that matter ) , and/or people with super - low expectations about their accomodations , food , and service .
		[0.298 0.266 0.213 0.114 0.109]

		overall dissapointment we booked this trip through apple vacations and overall i was very dissappointed in the resort .
		[0.204 0.237 0.235 0.160 0.163]

		[0.564 0.251 0.138 0.027 0.020]
		i want to be very fair writing this review , so i want to start with a few points , and the positives :1.
		[0.119 0.180 0.214 0.269 0.218]
		the beach was one of the most beautiful that i have ever experienced in my life , and i have traveled extensively2.
		[0.332 0.268 0.215 0.093 0.092]
		the bartenders at the pool bar were totally fun , amazing and friendly . . . especially julio !3.
		[0.121 0.182 0.218 0.238 0.240]
		rooms were clean and spacious , though not luxurios or moderni have to conclude by saying that i would never go back to the bavaro for the following reasons :1.
		[0.237 0.240 0.222 0.166 0.135]
		the place is too big , and too impersonal .
		[0.036 0.091 0.150 0.350 0.374]
		the staff is nice enough , not rude , but certainly do not go out of the way to make anyone feel special or pampered .2,
		[0.203 0.233 0.224 0.168 0.172]
		the reservation system is a disaster !
		[0.159 0.214 0.222 0.219 0.186]
		you have to get up early every morning to get a decent reservation .
		[0.395 0.271 0.193 0.074 0.067]
		certain people ( i hate to stereotype , but it always seemed to be the french - canadians ) , tried to cut in line and did not believe that they should be inconvenienced like everyone else .
		[0.360 0.275 0.209 0.081 0.076]
		you are on vacation , and are supposed to be able to relax , but , you cannot , if you want to get into a decent resturant .3.
		[0.229 0.245 0.223 0.151 0.152]
		the food is awful , and that is true of the buffet and resturants !
		[0.177 0.218 0.223 0.194 0.188]
		the buffets are so sub - par , but there is some type of selection for everyone .
		[0.153 0.210 0.234 0.205 0.199]
		the resturants , and that includes all , were gross !
		[0.103 0.169 0.207 0.283 0.237]
		the japanese place was loaded with msg , and everything tasted the same .
		[0.323 0.271 0.218 0.101 0.087]
		the italian was gross , and made olive garden look like a 5 star .
		[0.154 0.209 0.221 0.222 0.193]
		the fish grill was the worst of all .
		[0.345 0.270 0.207 0.096 0.082]
		tasteless , favorless and soggy !
		[0.382 0.278 0.209 0.083 0.048]
		i know i am from new york , and can be a bit of a food snob , but how anyone can say that these places are good , or even average , is so beyond comprehension ! 4. to add insult to injury , besides the food tasting awful , it also made everyone violently ill .
		[0.094 0.158 0.202 0.295 0.251]
		we are a family of four .
		[0.084 0.148 0.201 0.267 0.300]
		my husband and i are in our 30's , and my kids are 8 amd 9. we have traveled extensively , all over the world , and never did we get as sick as we did , here .
		[0.314 0.270 0.218 0.096 0.102]
		my 9 year old son was violently ill by the second day .
		[0.335 0.270 0.207 0.109 0.079]
		my husband , by the third day .
		[0.385 0.271 0.202 0.075 0.067]
		i was ill by the 5th day .
		[0.235 0.241 0.225 0.170 0.129]
		i thought my youngest daughter , who is a juvenile diabetic , had escaped , but by the time we got to the airport to fly home , she was vomiting and had diareah .
		[0.325 0.270 0.216 0.091 0.097]
		it took us three days back in new york for her to get back to normal .
		[0.364 0.273 0.206 0.080 0.076]
		as a juvenile diabetic , this was not an ideal situation for her . so to sum it up , if you only care about an inexpensive price , and an amazing beach , you may actually like this place .
		[0.163 0.207 0.222 0.216 0.192]
		but if good food and service are important , stay very , very far away from here .
		[0.046 0.104 0.165 0.320 0.364]

		[0.249 0.253 0.230 0.136 0.131]

		the most beautiful place . . . but i would not return we stayed at the bavaro princess quite some time ago , march 2006 to be exact , but never did get around to writing a review .
		[0.168 0.211 0.223 0.214 0.185]
		from time to time i always check out the reviews  pictures of this property , and am always surprised that the same complaint still keeps popping up . . . that is food poisoning .
		[0.235 0.248 0.231 0.138 0.149]
		that is what prompted me to finally write this review .
		[0.531 0.261 0.147 0.033 0.028]
		i had thoroughly researched this hotel for approx . 1 year before booking  the reviews were mostly good .
		[0.104 0.173 0.210 0.259 0.255]
		we booked through air canada vacations .
		[0.328 0.275 0.209 0.110 0.079]
		about 2 months before we left , reviews started showing up regarding food poisoning , which made me very nervous .
		[0.189 0.225 0.225 0.209 0.152]
		even waiting at the airport after check - in i was extremely worried , but other travellers i talked to said to just go  enjoy , all will be fine . we stayed for 2 weeks , and we upgraded to an oceanfront platinum club room , which i believe is well worth the price .
		[0.227 0.239 0.224 0.160 0.150]
		we had a beautiful room with a huge terrace , with a view to die for and only 75 steps to the beach .
		[0.089 0.153 0.199 0.295 0.263]
		there was no signs of neglect that i could see , and no bugs in the room .
		[0.336 0.271 0.213 0.088 0.092]
		and just the convenience of not having to wait in that line up to book your reservations was worth it . . . .it was a breeze .
		[0.182 0.218 0.224 0.192 0.185]
		all the staff at the platinum lounge were friendly  helpful , anna at the bar was great  made the best cocolocos , and a special thank - you to elso of turinter tours , who on our last night there personally picked us up in his car  showed us some dominican nightlife . . . he took us for pizza , and then to a bar/bowling alley/pool hall  we shot pool .
		[0.190 0.230 0.233 0.164 0.183]
		i spoke to the air canada rep down there about the food poisoning issue and even showed her the reviews on ta , and she assured us not to worry . as other reviewers have said , the beach is gorgeous .
		[0.385 0.276 0.201 0.077 0.061]
		in fact , it is one of the most beautiful beaches we have been to .
		[0.226 0.241 0.232 0.145 0.156]
		we had fun playing in the waves and walking the beach .
		[0.108 0.169 0.210 0.275 0.238]
		at night after dinner we would usually take a couple of beers to the beach  lay on a chair  just look at the stars and listen to the ocean .
		[0.235 0.249 0.232 0.144 0.140]
		it was heaven .
		[0.052 0.116 0.172 0.352 0.309]
		the resort grounds are beautiful .
		[0.277 0.255 0.226 0.122 0.119]
		we never took the trams anywhere , we always walked as it was too pretty to be zipping around through the property .
		[0.183 0.219 0.225 0.195 0.178]
		the mangrove  jungle in the middle was gorgeous . . . .one night that sticks out is when we walked back from licey through that area around 10ish ; the temperature was perfect  the moon was full .
		[0.250 0.255 0.231 0.134 0.130]
		it was a storybook moment ! we did not do any night shows ; i happened to see bits  pieces of the shows but they did not interest us , after all the beach at night was beckoning us .
		[0.323 0.270 0.207 0.103 0.097]
		we did some tours : the caving tour was fabulous , i highly recommend it .
		[0.060 0.122 0.181 0.314 0.323]
		we did the jeep safari . . . it was very interesting .
		[0.199 0.229 0.234 0.159 0.178]
		we also did the swim in the marinarium one sunday afternoon . . . i did think this one was rather lame .
		[0.259 0.254 0.228 0.127 0.132]
		we also went to saona ( gorgeous ) and sunset horseback riding which was also good . i have wonderful , fond memories of the beauty of this resort , but the one thing that marred our vacation was the food .
		[0.251 0.255 0.230 0.128 0.136]
		this is a huge problem here .
		[0.062 0.125 0.186 0.291 0.336]
		after worrying so much , the first week went off good .
		[0.238 0.243 0.229 0.142 0.149]
		we ate at the all the restaurants .
		[0.159 0.207 0.235 0.193 0.206]
		we basically stayed with food we knew , just to be cautious .
		[0.271 0.260 0.229 0.123 0.117]
		the food was okay , the pasta stations were good .
		[0.199 0.234 0.229 0.171 0.168]
		the italian restaurant was my favourite , and the buffets were good , but the gourmet licey i was not impressed with .
		[0.158 0.205 0.221 0.230 0.187]
		el gaucho was just plain terrible ; my husband 's steak looked like shoe leather , the buns were as hard as baseballs , and i was served a tiny baked potato and a pile of steamed onions . . . .blah !
		[0.201 0.229 0.224 0.188 0.158]
		the rest of the food was good , but midway through week two , my husband did not feel well .
		[0.233 0.241 0.231 0.145 0.150]
		we tried to tell ourselves maybe he was in the sun too long  suffered heat stroke or something along that line , but it just got worse  worse .
		[0.347 0.273 0.203 0.099 0.079]
		he could not leave the room  was in the bathroom 95% of the time .
		[0.278 0.256 0.217 0.131 0.119]
		finally after 2 days , he went to the doctor ( who is very nice ) , but we had to wait in a line because he was not the only one who was suffering from . .you guessed it . . . . food poisoning .
		[0.359 0.274 0.208 0.078 0.082]
		she put him on an iv because he was so dehydrated  gave him pills to take , which settled his stomach enough that we could go out with elso on our last night there , although my husband had no appetite for the pizza .
		[0.435 0.274 0.187 0.055 0.050]
		so the last five days were a write off .
		[0.269 0.258 0.228 0.127 0.118]
		when we arrived home , my husband did not feel right for the next 2 weeks . . . . . it was just wicked , he has never been so sick in his life .
		[0.362 0.272 0.207 0.082 0.078]
		because there were so many people with food poisoning , the next day i saw a food inspector there  all the food staff were wearing face masks .
		[0.288 0.260 0.215 0.120 0.117]
		i told the hotel of our misfortune , and they sent us up milk  bananas ( i guess to try  soothe his stomach ) .
		[0.340 0.266 0.205 0.104 0.084]
		on a side note , i did not get food poisoning . . . but i do not eat meat , whereas my husband did .
		[0.267 0.252 0.218 0.143 0.120]
		however , it is very hard to pinpoint where the source of the bug is as this is just such a huge resort with so much staff , it could be anything . that is my experience with this resort , and i am surprised that they are still having problems here .
		[0.140 0.192 0.219 0.227 0.222]
		before we left i told myself that the people who complained were just being picky , or liked to complain about something everyday , or overindulged in alcohol or the like , but even though we were worried , i gave the resort the benefit of the doubt .
		[0.339 0.274 0.214 0.090 0.083]
		this is what happened , so those who have experienced this are not fabricating it  just to complain . . . . it does exist here so just be cautious . in retrospect , i feel bittersweet about the bavaro , that is why i come back here sometimes to look at the pictures  read the reviews . . . . it does bring back good memories of the natural beauty of the resort , and i really do miss that . . .walking through the grounds  the beach at night  the gorgeous countryside .
		[0.237 0.250 0.233 0.137 0.142]
		however , we will never return to this resort , nor the dominican for that matter as the food quality is questionable and let 's face it . . . .food poisoning on a vacation is not fun at any expense !
		[0.296 0.267 0.224 0.108 0.105]
		just my two cents . . . .finally !

		[0.162 0.197 0.262 0.201 0.178]

		[0.276 0.257 0.228 0.122 0.118]

		[0.266 0.255 0.230 0.127 0.122]

		[0.430 0.274 0.185 0.059 0.052]
		finally , fifteen minutes later , i was called by the concierge and informed that i had tickets to snorkeling . he said he had been there since 7am and could have helped me .

		this kind of miscommuniation is inexcusable at a property like this ! lastly , our plane was due to leave at 4pm the day we checked out .
		[0.337 0.272 0.214 0.090 0.086]
		we called to get late check out - even asked to pay for late check out - and were rudely informed that our rate was already super cheap and late checkout was not avaialble to us .
		[0.395 0.276 0.189 0.075 0.065]

		[0.191 0.232 0.237 0.174 0.166]
		with the money my work spent on alcohol alone at this place ( ! ) i think they made enough money off of us to not be so rude . to sum it up , the property is standard ritz - which is of course nice ! the beach is very nice .
		[0.159 0.204 0.222 0.216 0.199]
		the location is very out of the way - close only to the airport ( which was not too noisy for us .

		[0.045 0.103 0.169 0.304 0.380]

		[0.115 0.175 0.211 0.253 0.246]

		nice stay , slightly over rated my husband and i split our time between the ritz and the marriott on our trip to puerto rico .
		[0.173 0.221 0.235 0.185 0.186]
		we were prepared to be pampered at the ritz , but our experience was average .
		[0.139 0.192 0.217 0.238 0.215]
		i absolutely felt that the rc paid special attention to the older guests , and my husband and i are in our mid 20's .
		[0.150 0.200 0.220 0.236 0.194]

		[0.408 0.272 0.189 0.075 0.056]
		sure this was not the end of the world , its just not why you pay for the ritz .
		[0.204 0.230 0.235 0.165 0.166]
		there was also a fire drill , which apparently we should have been warned about via a letter in our room , but we were not .
		[0.309 0.267 0.221 0.105 0.098]
		so my husband and i evacuated via stairs to the exterior of the hotel , and we were some of the only guests in our pajamas trying to evacuate !
		[0.291 0.261 0.215 0.112 0.121]
		its a funny story now , but was very embarrassing then .
		[0.173 0.218 0.224 0.196 0.189]
		our most recent trip was to hawaii where we experienced an earth quake , so i do not take alarms lightly .

		on the beach , the attendants were wonderful .
		[0.075 0.138 0.189 0.298 0.299]
		i love to be in the sun , and he loves the shade , so they always set up an umbrella nearby for him .
		[0.182 0.220 0.223 0.212 0.163]
		i highly recommend lunch on the beach , delivered to your chairs !
		[0.169 0.215 0.234 0.190 0.192]
		much of the pool stays shaded during parts of the day , so the beach was the better bet . other service was so - so .
		[0.235 0.246 0.224 0.148 0.147]

		great food  we were here for a company retreat and would not have usually chosen this type of location for a vacation .
		[0.091 0.155 0.198 0.277 0.279]
		we typically prefer beaches that are less commercial and built - up .
		[0.297 0.269 0.225 0.124 0.085]
		however , if you are visiting san juan for business or to see family , then this would be a nice place to stay .
		[0.085 0.148 0.199 0.282 0.286]
		the positives : the food and service were very good .
		[0.194 0.227 0.233 0.165 0.180]
		they handled our large group well .
		[0.418 0.280 0.198 0.059 0.044]
		i have stayed at many ritz carlton properties before and these aspects of our stay definitely lived up to ritz standards .
		[0.123 0.189 0.227 0.231 0.230]
		the negatives : yes the rooms are luxurious , well kept and clean , and have all the amenities of a 5 star hotel , however , they do not make you feel like you are at the beach .
		[0.105 0.166 0.207 0.262 0.259]
		these rooms are decorated as if they could be practically anywhere and do not open - up to nature .
		[0.360 0.274 0.208 0.083 0.074]
		it seems that ritz carltons tend to do this while four seasons usually make their properties fit with the environment and location better .
		[0.155 0.211 0.223 0.226 0.185]
		although in this setting ( a built - up beach ) there is not really anything to open - up to .
		[0.204 0.235 0.233 0.156 0.173]
		the ritz definitely feels more like a hotel rather than a resort so it depends on what you are looking for . overall , a good place for a company retreat or convention , but not a place for a caribbean vacation .

		the pool area was clean and chairs were always available5.

		the beach was , ehh ok . . . at best 6.
		[0.109 0.173 0.211 0.246 0.262]
		check - in was easy and we checked in early without even notifying the desk about our early arrival7.

		[0.132 0.194 0.231 0.214 0.228]
		by the sound of the other reviewers , it seemed like the ritz likes to accomodate celebrations with free upgrades or special perks upon arrival .
		[0.129 0.196 0.228 0.228 0.219]
		since nothing was offered , i just figured i 'd ask if there were any upgrades available , and that we we 're just married on saturday .

		[0.351 0.271 0.202 0.104 0.072]
		also , there are some extra fees . . . the hotel charges you a 10% a day resort fee .
		[0.171 0.217 0.230 0.186 0.196]
		then you also have to pay either $17 ( self ) or $25- $28 ( valet ) a day for parking .
		[0.066 0.130 0.183 0.324 0.297]
		when you order room service there is a $2.50/person fee plus the 17% gratuity added on .

		like mentioned in the other reviews , there is noticeable plane noise .
		[0.073 0.139 0.189 0.296 0.302]
		it was not constant , and not extremely disturbing , but you can hear it and it could be distracting , i guess , but it did not bother us .

		at night it got a little busy and sometimes the locals were not too happy to share a table with you .
		[0.101 0.164 0.207 0.270 0.258]
		most of the dealers didnt bother to speak with you or really interact with you unless you spoke spanish .
		[0.303 0.265 0.213 0.119 0.100]
		i can honestly say that these employees were really interested in doing anything other than dealing cards .
		[0.272 0.259 0.220 0.143 0.106]
		they spent alot of time looking around and talking to each other from table to table durning the game .
		[0.316 0.268 0.220 0.104 0.091]
		my best advice to you is to buy the insurance on the rental car if you get one .
		[0.080 0.145 0.194 0.303 0.278]
		there is apparently no rules or regulations on the roads .
		[0.280 0.264 0.227 0.125 0.104]
		( i only got stopped because i was driving unbeknownst in the bus lane lol ) but the officer barely spoke english so he just told me to do a u - turn in the middle of the road ( which is common ) and continue on my way .
		[0.280 0.264 0.225 0.116 0.115]
		and . . . beware if you drive into old san juan .

		from a child - friendly perspective , they should take a cue from the 4seasons this resort touts itself as child friendly and does have some amenities for children .
		[0.104 0.166 0.205 0.274 0.250]
		however they do not go the extra step like the four seasons .
		[0.199 0.228 0.225 0.190 0.157]
		for example , the four seasons provides diapers , swim diapers , baby floats , toys , and most important , strollers .
		[0.066 0.132 0.185 0.348 0.270]
		this makes travelling extremely easy - - you need a car seat stroller to fly , so it 's so nice to be able to avoid bringing a second one for the beach/pool .
		[0.141 0.200 0.221 0.227 0.211]
		of course , the four seasons charges a resort fee too - - but it 's the convenience of having those items that make it worth it . i had been corresponding with the ritz about these items for weeks in advance of my trip and did not get a straight answer as to what they can provide or not .
		[0.195 0.229 0.225 0.177 0.174]
		responses are very vague , which makes it quite difficult to pack .
		[0.099 0.169 0.216 0.245 0.270]
		if i were them , i would take a cue from the 4s , spend a few hundred dollars on a handful of strollers and baby amenities and advertise it as a convenience .
		[0.107 0.169 0.207 0.273 0.244]
		as of now , i will go back to the 4s where it 's quite clear what they provide and it is very easy to travel with children .

		there was a seafood buffet on friday night that was not very good .
		[0.111 0.172 0.212 0.256 0.249]
		they had raw oysters , a rarity for a buffet , and i quickly figured out why after i spit the first one i tasted out .

		i hope that they had been frozen first , and they were horrible .
		[0.574 0.250 0.131 0.025 0.020]
		there was an il mulino in the casino and a blt steak .
		[0.057 0.122 0.179 0.329 0.313]
		i highly suggest that you avoid them both and come to nyc if you would like to try either .
		[0.236 0.244 0.230 0.153 0.137]
		san juan is not las vegas , and the restaurants were very overpriced and were hollow shells of what they should have been .
		[0.183 0.222 0.227 0.177 0.191]
		it 's sad that tourondel has attached his name to blt steak in pr and i plan on writing a letter to let him know how bad it was .
		[0.294 0.268 0.224 0.119 0.095]
		it was foreshadowing when i sat at the bar for a cocktail and asked what kind of bourbon they had and was told jack daniels or canadian club ( neither a bourbon ) and then was mocked when i asked that a glass of red wine be poured in a wine glass meant for red wine ( they had given me a narrow white glass ) .
		[0.179 0.218 0.223 0.210 0.171]
		they apparently thought i wanted a bigger pour ( it was a bigger glass ) .
		[0.202 0.236 0.229 0.182 0.151]
		someone at a dive bar should expect better , much less a ritz where their motto should be to serve it to me in my shoe if i request . pool area : crowded , but you could always find chairs .
		[0.238 0.248 0.237 0.139 0.137]
		the pool service was horrible . final thoughts : i 'll try not to rant , but i really wish resorts like the ritz carlton would take a cue from the four seasons and stop charging resort fees .
		[0.212 0.239 0.226 0.166 0.158]
		please , just increase the price of the room .
		[0.170 0.218 0.240 0.189 0.183]
		it 's not fair to business travelers , who may not use the pool , and not fair to people who expect some decent service out of their 10% ( $60+ ) .
		[0.186 0.224 0.226 0.190 0.175]
		the pool staff could not be bothered to set up a chair , no one came around to give water much less drinks , etc , etc . please , just charge it as part of the cost of the room , and then make your workers actually work for the possibility that they might get tips for doing what should be their jobs .
		[0.226 0.238 0.222 0.169 0.145]
		everyone just feels ripped off , and no one wins . the service at the ritz could have been much better .
		[0.223 0.241 0.223 0.153 0.159]
		it was not bad , except at the restaurants , but it was not 4/5 star either .
		[0.289 0.260 0.223 0.112 0.116]
		they need to get better food and/or get the backers of their 'name ' restaurants to give their brands a little bit of attention .
		[0.342 0.274 0.213 0.089 0.082]
		in the end , it?? still a ritz carlton and a good hotel .
		[0.048 0.107 0.170 0.312 0.364]

		it was nice but definately not worth the price they charge the ritz in puerto rico is really nice and the service is amazing , but i would never stay there again if i went back .
		[0.062 0.123 0.181 0.303 0.331]
		first of all i would not recommend staying in this area , you 're a stones throw away from the airport so while relaxing on the beach you hear the jets taking off and landing .
		[0.110 0.171 0.207 0.264 0.248]
		it was a late honeymoon for us and we 'd just found out we were expecting and our rate was 710.00 a night and we had read some posts about the hotel being so good at upgrading on special occasions but nothing - we had a view of the airport and the parking lot .
		[0.090 0.152 0.198 0.287 0.273]
		the service at the hotel was definately excellent and if you have money to throw away i guess you 'd think it was worth it , but for 700.00 a night plus a 10% resort fee you 'd think you 'd just get something worthwhile there .
		[0.173 0.220 0.232 0.177 0.198]
		the continental breakfast in the mornings is 17.00 which is crazy for some fruit and pastries .
		[0.018 0.060 0.118 0.400 0.404]
		i personally think the other hotels in that same strip are just as nice and not nearly as pricey .
		[0.137 0.197 0.231 0.220 0.215]

		ritz - - -not worth full price we visited the ritz in early december , and were able to take advantage of pre - season rates , which made the stay worth what we paid when booking a deal which we did via this site and expedia .
		[0.073 0.137 0.190 0.315 0.285]
		but travelers doing so must be aware of the added 20% or so to any room rate with the combined taxes and resort fee which we discovered were added after we booked the room on the site . were we to have paid top rate , i would have been very disappointed in our ritz experience .
		[0.262 0.257 0.230 0.128 0.123]
		while staff and service were top - notch , the pool is crowded with beach chairs and with a predominantly new york clientele , many of whom speak loudly on cell phones disturbing the peace that most people seek on vacations . the beach is a better choice , and while the surf is a often a bit rough , beach chairs can be moved to more quiet locations . most rooms have no balconies , so one cannot enjoy relaxing privately outside while enjoying the tropical sunset . we did enjoy lunches at the poolside restaurant , which were extremely well - prepared and generous in portion , though very pricey .

		[0.216 0.230 0.242 0.162 0.149]

		when we got there at 10;00pm it was closed up like a drum .
		[0.322 0.264 0.218 0.098 0.099]

		[0.008 0.034 0.087 0.379 0.492]

		[0.206 0.238 0.236 0.162 0.158]
		if you want to go to the beach , give yourself 30-45 minutes to get there as the hotel has 2 of these cable car type buggys and one has been broken for weeks so everyone has to use just one .

		[0.073 0.139 0.190 0.323 0.275]

		beatiful resort that needs to work some major issues there have been enough reviews of this hotel ( seemingly mostly negative ) for anyone reading these posts to make their own opinion on whether they want to stay at this resort .
		[0.230 0.227 0.262 0.156 0.125]
		i just wanted to add my 2 cents as i have family that regularly stays in the casitas area of the resort and let me in on some information that any new guests should know . first , this is no longer a wyndham property it has been bought by a company called blackstone ( i am not familiar with them at all ) and the resort is going through a major transition .
		[0.187 0.221 0.222 0.194 0.175]
		please keep this in mind when making your reservations .
		[0.436 0.272 0.187 0.061 0.044]
		i made my reservations for this resort back in may as an american express promotional ; through the wyndham reservations hotline and had a difficult time with wyndham customer service once i checked into the resort .
		[0.330 0.274 0.216 0.093 0.088]
		i had reserved an oceanview room and upon check in i had a lovely view of the tennis courts , also once the luggage was delivered to the room there was white paint on one of the pieces and to put the icing on the cake i did not get the wyndham by request amenities in the room as promised .
		[0.224 0.245 0.235 0.150 0.146]
		i tried to resolve these issues with the management of the hotel but i got a frustrating run around ultimately only being able to leave a voicemail to a generic voice mail box as the resort manager could not be found .
		[0.360 0.274 0.199 0.089 0.078]
		once i ran into the brick wall of no customer service or satisfaction - i called the wyndham 800 number directly and receieved no help and i mean nothing !
		[0.446 0.275 0.181 0.058 0.040]
		i was told since the resort had been transferred to new owners only 2 days prior to my arrival they would not be able to do anything for me .
		[0.512 0.265 0.155 0.037 0.031]
		this made me extremely angry since this was not communicated to me at anytime prior to arrival to this resort .
		[0.406 0.274 0.186 0.075 0.059]
		wyndham gladly took my money for these reservations ( i had to put down a 2 day deposit via my credit card ) and kindly said i was sol .
		[0.435 0.277 0.187 0.057 0.044]
		i will never stay at another wyndham property because of this - i will gladly put my money towards other chains in the future . not to bore you with the details - it all eventually worked out once security got involved to help me with my problem with the paint on my suitcase .
		[0.323 0.273 0.216 0.098 0.090]
		the security manager saw how upset i was ( and i was also on the phone with american express to try to stay at another hotel ) moved me to an oceanview room and cleaned up my bag - thanks again felipe !
		[0.318 0.270 0.219 0.099 0.094]
		once i actually got a manager i even got my wyndham by request amenities but this was a day later . i hope that the new owners will restore this property to the glory that it once was because this truly is a lovely location for a resort .

		[0.322 0.269 0.223 0.098 0.088]
		as far as the fridge goes , they informed us they used to have minibars , but they removed them recently .
		[0.352 0.269 0.203 0.100 0.077]
		having heard this , we opted for the fridge for $25 for our whole stay .
		[0.125 0.191 0.229 0.224 0.231]

		[0.290 0.271 0.238 0.105 0.096]

		[0.147 0.211 0.243 0.221 0.178]
		we also purchased a dollar of braised pork chunks , and a side of rice and beans .

		[0.025 0.070 0.139 0.374 0.391]

		[0.110 0.172 0.208 0.281 0.229]

		[0.140 0.200 0.229 0.218 0.213]
		our server also propped his leg up on one of our chairs to watch football while we were dining and picked his nose , then checked to see if he had and debris on his finger afterwards .
		[0.258 0.251 0.220 0.156 0.115]
		gross . the beach was kind of littered with debris from a previous storm , but they offer free umbrellas when you make your trek to your beach chairs .
		[0.270 0.260 0.232 0.128 0.110]
		highly suggested if you don?? want a sunburn since you??e pretty close to the equator .
		[0.285 0.253 0.224 0.120 0.118]
		we took a trek out 20 minutes west off rio mar and found a really nice secluded beach with showers which branched off of these condo buildings , but we forgot water , so we drank from the shower !
		[0.142 0.197 0.219 0.251 0.191]
		hey , it?? not mexico and i have a stomach of steel . pool and hot tub are open 24 hours , so it was nice to maximize on the cabanas at night and watch the stars .

		[0.085 0.153 0.200 0.311 0.251]
		first time to puerto rico . rio mar is very expensive for the somewhat mediocre standard .
		[0.084 0.151 0.201 0.286 0.278]
		the whole resort is of usual 4 star carribean standard , but service/management is of higher quality than in 'spanish ' carribean places . we got a free upgrade from resort view to ocean view , in main building .

		write them in advance . room was alright - almost nice , but not great .
		[0.209 0.239 0.244 0.160 0.148]
		bathroom was roomy , however , the handyman must have had 10 thumbs and no ruler when doing the installations/tiling . floor cold as ice , conditioner noisy and could not do heating .
		[0.214 0.243 0.233 0.151 0.160]

		[0.105 0.166 0.211 0.263 0.256]
		valet staff have the slowest 'walk ' i have ever seen . food and beverages are quite expensive , e . g . 5 usd for local beer and 10 usd for cocktails which arent all that .
		[0.165 0.218 0.232 0.199 0.186]
		a good lunch or dinner for two will set you back 100 usd plus wine/alcohol . a dinner in the japanese restaurant scared us off from eating anything else than breakfast in the resort .
		[0.219 0.244 0.235 0.151 0.152]
		i cant recall having tasted more bland sushi/rolls/salads anywhere else . pool - area was nice , but sunbeds were only good in the adult section .
		[0.148 0.206 0.234 0.206 0.206]
		not enough sunscreens .
		[0.290 0.260 0.232 0.114 0.104]
		150 usd for renting a poolside cabina/tent - roof per day - crazy ! the iguanas were funny - suddenly running down the palms - even moved around near the pool .
		[0.341 0.275 0.222 0.099 0.063]
		do go for iguana feeding at 11.00 - especially if you are childish or have kids . the beach was nice too , but somewhat windy .
		[0.171 0.217 0.223 0.193 0.197]
		surf probably too big for kids younger than teenagers .
		[0.098 0.172 0.231 0.297 0.202]
		the beach could look a lot nicer with better sunbeds , sunscreens and decor , but as it is now , its not attractive to lie there . you need a car to get out of the resort .

		[0.157 0.214 0.240 0.202 0.187]
		for example , we arrived to check in ( at around 10:30 pm ) , the clerk was busy entering something in the computer for 3 to 5 minutes .
		[0.335 0.272 0.215 0.095 0.083]
		she did not acknowledge our existence until she was finished .
		[0.646 0.226 0.103 0.015 0.011]

		[0.477 0.271 0.168 0.045 0.038]
		you would have thought that checking in your customers would be more important than doing computer work . other problems included a locked in room safe .
		[0.236 0.250 0.234 0.144 0.135]
		the previous tenant never unlocked the safe .
		[0.234 0.240 0.227 0.158 0.141]

		the front desk said they would , but they never did .
		[0.562 0.251 0.136 0.027 0.024]

		[0.342 0.276 0.221 0.091 0.070]

		[0.316 0.268 0.219 0.099 0.097]
		finally , because the rooms do not have a microwave oven , we called the front desk to see if they would heat up our food .
		[0.486 0.268 0.168 0.041 0.037]

		[0.158 0.205 0.223 0.213 0.201]

		good times in pr my wife and i just returned from a week at the westin riomar in beautiful pr .
		[0.081 0.145 0.197 0.294 0.282]
		i read some of the reviews here before leaving and agree with some of what was said but would like to set the record straight on a number of things .
		[0.137 0.196 0.217 0.217 0.233]
		first our room was very nice ( not musty ) , pool and ocean view and the maid service was excellent .
		[0.114 0.177 0.220 0.224 0.265]
		the food depending on the restaurant was good to excellent ( i ca not understand how people have complained about the food here ) , i highly recommend the sea bass at ajili mojili ( authentic pr dishes ) in the ocean villas and the porterhouse steak at the grilleroom ( located above the golf clubhouse , great views ) .
		[0.112 0.175 0.209 0.249 0.254]
		key tip : find out early the days each restaurant is open during your stay and make reservations , it is very hard to walk - up and get a table even if the restaurant does not look full .
		[0.226 0.237 0.255 0.145 0.137]
		the views of the rainforest were incredible , and there was lots of great nature sounds in the evening ( the coqui frogs ! )
		[0.063 0.130 0.182 0.307 0.317]
		one of the primary reasons we chose this resort was for the golf , and both courses are very nice but not spectacular , they charge $165 to play earlier in the day ( way overpriced ) but offer a twilight rate that starts at 2pm for $105( we booked our tee times in advance right at 2pm ) the pace of play was great and you have incredible views of the mountains and plenty of wildlife ( birds  iguanas of every size ) .
		[0.142 0.204 0.229 0.212 0.213]
		the pools and ocean swimming are great just keep in mind the beach is brown sand and not white .
		[0.097 0.167 0.216 0.254 0.266]
		if you are looking for lots of nightlife this is not the place for you , the only real nightlife is the small casino ( and i mean small ! ) which is very poorly run .
		[0.055 0.117 0.174 0.308 0.345]
		overall the service at the resort was fairly good , a little inconsistent at times but not too bad , but the service in the casino is terrible , the dealers and cashiers are not friendly and there are many slot machines not working properly and they do not know how to run a craps table ( many payouts screwed up ) and the cocktail waitresses in the casino are horrible they disappear for long stretches and one forgot to bring my drink twice and then finally brought me the wrong drink , you will end up going to the lobby bar for drinks , and it does not make sense because the casino is so small .

		we were looking for a scenic resort with good food to relax and play golf for a week .

		birthday vacation the staff was wonderful , friendly , and oh so helpful . although not allowed i tipped the staff and i did receive the royal service . the lobby and beach were beautifulthere was construction when i visitied . there is always the beach and the activites were not available because of the weather .
		[0.225 0.244 0.234 0.143 0.153]
		other than the beach the activites are limited .
		[0.106 0.169 0.207 0.282 0.236]
		so it was more of a realxing vacation as opposed to an adventurous one .
		[0.168 0.210 0.220 0.203 0.200]

		[0.057 0.119 0.182 0.315 0.327]

		average i relied on reviews from this site immensely before booking so i owe it to others to give my review .
		[0.245 0.246 0.232 0.141 0.135]
		we booked 2 connecting rooms for 4 adults and 4 children (1,3,7,11) .
		[0.220 0.239 0.231 0.154 0.156]
		the first thing i must mention is that we booked in the reserve section of the hotel and therefore my opinion is based on accommodations in that section .
		[0.211 0.240 0.234 0.164 0.151]
		the reserve section is the newer section of the hotel .
		[0.075 0.143 0.192 0.316 0.274]
		it is further away from the beach , about a 15 minute walk or a quick golf tram ride , which run by the front of your unit and are fairly constant .
		[0.110 0.171 0.211 0.277 0.231]
		we booked 2 family concierge rooms .
		[0.206 0.233 0.232 0.170 0.159]
		the perks include a concierge that will assist you with pretty much everything including restaurant and activities bookings , special requests , etc .
		[0.064 0.129 0.183 0.358 0.266]
		for example , liquor is not included in the room service , but our concierge made sure i had some cognac in my room every evening ( at my request ) .
		[0.213 0.238 0.233 0.149 0.166]
		we also got a welcome kit for each one of the kids that included t - shirts , caps , floaties for the pool , sandals , and a few other toys .
		[0.092 0.157 0.199 0.278 0.275]
		also as a reserve member you have access to an onsite restaurant ( don?? remember the name ) where you can have menu service breakfast in case you don?? want to go to the buffet .
		[0.235 0.249 0.233 0.140 0.143]
		arrival : airport is nice and customs/baggage claim was pretty quick and efficient .
		[0.070 0.141 0.203 0.287 0.299]
		i recommend you shell out the money for a cab ( about $40) and don?? take the hotel shuttle .
		[0.091 0.154 0.199 0.289 0.266]
		this will ensure you don?? have to wait at the airport and don?? have to make any stops on the way to your hotel .
		[0.254 0.247 0.221 0.151 0.126]
		but more importantly , it lets you arrive earlier than those that were on your flight and also staying at your hotel , creating delays and a line at check - in .
		[0.183 0.227 0.236 0.173 0.181]
		rooms : the rooms were excellent .
		[0.053 0.113 0.180 0.303 0.351]
		all modern appliances/fixtures ; comfortable beds ; very spacious ; nice bathrooms ; we were all very happy and impressed and looked forward to going back to our rooms at the end of the day .
		[0.071 0.134 0.190 0.311 0.295]
		housekeeping did a very good job putting the place back in order after the kids made their messes , although they were not consistent on timings .
		[0.296 0.265 0.224 0.108 0.107]
		one day it would be at 10am , the next at 4pm , etc .
		[0.116 0.177 0.211 0.264 0.232]
		the room service menu at the resort is one of the best i have seen .
		[0.143 0.195 0.222 0.216 0.224]
		although they had nothing fancy , they did offer steak and shrimp dishes , in addition to the usual burgers , pizza , and sandwiches (24 hours by the way ) .
		[0.158 0.208 0.222 0.232 0.180]
		the fridge in your room does not get automatically restocked ; you have to ask for it . food : food was good in the buffets , nothing outstanding .
		[0.240 0.250 0.221 0.145 0.144]
		they need a little more variety .
		[0.108 0.173 0.224 0.252 0.244]
		after about the 4th day we were already tired of it .
		[0.332 0.269 0.218 0.097 0.084]
		the restaurants for the most part were good , although the wait times to get your order were ridiculous ( sometimes 45+ minutes ) .
		[0.237 0.248 0.232 0.143 0.140]
		we did not have any problem getting into any of the restaurants but that was because were had the concierge service .
		[0.328 0.264 0.213 0.101 0.095]
		he took care of all our reservations for the entire week .
		[0.502 0.263 0.158 0.043 0.033]
		we saw quite a few people get turned away because either they arrived late or did not have reservations .
		[0.441 0.272 0.182 0.057 0.048]
		with the exception of the gabi restaurant in the reserve section , all restaurants are in the open so it is hot . liquor : the liquor selection was decent ; if you drink cognac they have remy martin , they also have jwblack , jd , top shelf vodkas and other good selections .
		[0.239 0.251 0.234 0.141 0.136]
		they also have premium liquors such as johnny walker blue and hennessy xo , but they are not included in the all - inclusive and you have to purchase the entire bottle at about 250 to 300 a bottle .
		[0.307 0.267 0.215 0.111 0.100]
		they have a wide variety of tropical drinks .
		[0.329 0.269 0.209 0.113 0.079]
		beach : the beach was outstanding , with minimal seaweed , turquoise warm water , and white sands .
		[0.155 0.209 0.221 0.207 0.209]
		as a reserve member you have access to an exclusive section of the beach and therefore we never had any trouble finding empty palapas ( giant straw umbrellas ) or a spot on the beach .
		[0.243 0.254 0.234 0.145 0.124]
		the best part of this section was the food service ; we were able to order snacks like burgers , hotdogs , sandwiches and pizza and have them brought to us right on the beach ( alcoholic drinks also ) .
		[0.147 0.199 0.218 0.226 0.210]
		this was very convenient since it would have been a hassle to leave the comforts of the beach and have to pick up and go to the buffet when we got hungry .
		[0.319 0.268 0.218 0.097 0.098]
		be advised that there are many topless women walking by and laying on the beach in this area . pools : pools were very nice and large , with convenient swim - up bars .
		[0.145 0.204 0.233 0.206 0.213]
		the reserve section has a separate pool for its members and a special kiddie pool that is pretty nice . entertainment : if you have been to a resort before , then don?? expect anything different from the nightly shows you have probably seen .
		[0.175 0.218 0.224 0.198 0.186]
		if not , then just think high school type performances , including the michael jackson show which seems to be a standard at every damn resort .
		[0.197 0.229 0.224 0.178 0.173]
		on one night , a show took place on the beach where they had your fire - eater , and other ??dd? ? type performances , also included were female dancers on elevated stands .
		[0.278 0.264 0.227 0.115 0.116]
		pretty nice show and a nice break from the usual stage performances .
		[0.057 0.123 0.179 0.311 0.330]
		we only went to the nightclub once and to my surprise it was pretty good .
		[0.177 0.214 0.225 0.196 0.188]
		a good balance of the sexes , good music and friendly service .
		[0.079 0.147 0.200 0.262 0.312]
		shopping : there are several shopping areas nearby , just a short cab ride away .
		[0.042 0.101 0.166 0.345 0.346]
		regardless of where you go however , unless you are with a local , be prepared to be overcharged .
		[0.224 0.247 0.245 0.150 0.134]
		there are opportunities to get good deals though .
		[0.233 0.246 0.232 0.147 0.143]
		i picked up an oil painting for $100.
		[0.246 0.253 0.224 0.163 0.114]
		when i took it to a shop in nyc to get it framed , the owner told me he could sell the painting for $2,500.
		[0.371 0.276 0.203 0.077 0.073]
		the only problem i saw with this hotel was the attitude of the check - in staff .
		[0.184 0.223 0.233 0.169 0.191]
		these people act as if they are doing you a favor by checking you in .
		[0.367 0.276 0.207 0.082 0.068]
		the rest of the staff however were very friendly and helpful .
		[0.025 0.071 0.137 0.336 0.432]
		the time share pitch pretty much stopped after we firmly told them we were not interested .
		[0.426 0.276 0.182 0.064 0.051]
		if you can afford it , and don?? mind not being on the beach , i would highly recommend the reserve area/concierge service ( royal service if you have no kids ) .
		[0.277 0.259 0.225 0.117 0.121]
		having someone to make all your reservations and book all your activities really makes a difference and avoids much aggravation .
		[0.267 0.256 0.227 0.126 0.123]
		not to mention the fact that they will assist you with any special requests .
		[0.399 0.276 0.196 0.071 0.057]
		they issue you a cell phone so that you may contact your assigned concierge directly at any time for your needs .
		[0.265 0.254 0.220 0.150 0.110]
		overall we had a good experience at the resort .
		[0.133 0.182 0.222 0.224 0.240]
		if not for the bad attitude of the check - in staff , and the fact that i congratulated a lady for her expectant child , but then turned out not to be pregnant , the trip would have been above average .

		two major problems : 1.
		[0.299 0.266 0.221 0.134 0.080]
		we arrived at 1pm , check in is not until 3pm .
		[0.280 0.258 0.217 0.140 0.105]
		we did not get into our room until 4pm - we travelled during the off season - so the resort was not crowded , reception repeated told us our room was not cleaned yet and kept advising us 15 more minutes , a familar story that was also told to other guests that we spoke to duing our stay .
		[0.411 0.276 0.190 0.063 0.061]
		2. the day we checked out , we got to the airport when i realized i had left a bag which contained a battery charger to my digital camera in a draw in my room , as soon as i got home i phoned the resort and spoke to 2 people in lost and found who told me nothing was turned in .
		[0.390 0.277 0.199 0.071 0.063]
		i then spoke with a manager and was told he spoke to housekeeping and was told nothing was found in the room .
		[0.500 0.266 0.160 0.040 0.035]
		so obviously the bag was stolen and not reported to the lost and found - which is very dishearting because the bag was a cheap cavas bag w/ only a battery charger in it .
		[0.260 0.257 0.232 0.133 0.118]
		i was also told by another guest who had left some costume jewerly out on her dresser , which was stolen as well and when she reported it stolen the manager told her to call the local police and was of no help .
		[0.491 0.269 0.163 0.041 0.036]
		so be careful about what you leave out - use your safe and triple check your room before checking out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

		non - smokers wo not be happy my wife and i have stayed at several all - inclusive resorts in recent years and went to paradisus , punta cana based on positive experiences at the riu bambu ( punta cana ) and paradisus playa conchal ( costa rica ) .
		[0.376 0.277 0.206 0.076 0.065]
		our overall experience was mixed and less than we hoped . grounds are beautiful , room was fine ( except a bit musty upon arrival ) , staff helpful and friendly .
		[0.087 0.156 0.210 0.257 0.291]
		we enjoyed numerous included activities ( e . g . , horseback riding , golf , scuba diving ) .
		[0.132 0.200 0.229 0.250 0.188]
		our biggest disappointment was cigarette  cigar smoke .
		[0.420 0.279 0.189 0.072 0.040]
		we do not smoke and , aside from the hibiscus buffet restaurant , no restaurant ( not one of the 8 specialty restaurants ) has a non - smoking area .
		[0.263 0.259 0.231 0.128 0.119]
		we were constanly surrounded by smoke and it was most uncomfortable .
		[0.307 0.267 0.223 0.114 0.089]
		given that in toronto where we live ( and many other cities around the world ) smoking is not allowed at all in restaurants ( and most bars ) this is particularly annoying .
		[0.168 0.220 0.238 0.192 0.182]
		we 've generally been able to find smoke free areas in restaurants in other resorts but this was simply not possible at paradisus , punta cana .
		[0.378 0.276 0.202 0.078 0.066]
		if you do not smoke and smoke bothers you select another hotel until sol melia gets more progressive and accommodating .
		[0.366 0.278 0.206 0.083 0.068]
		as an aside , several staff said it bothers them greatly too . the other comment is that the restaurants do not pay much attention to vegetables .
		[0.275 0.263 0.228 0.122 0.113]
		in the french specialty restaurant appetizers and main courses were all meat .
		[0.330 0.273 0.213 0.113 0.072]
		a tiny bit of pureed something beside a large steak was hardly a balanced meal .
		[0.091 0.161 0.211 0.258 0.278]
		we ended up going to the buffet for salad before the meal .
		[0.325 0.269 0.218 0.102 0.086]
		on the other hand , if you like lobster , you 'll love the seafood restaurant .
		[0.236 0.248 0.233 0.145 0.138]
		we liked the japanese restaurant in large part because the seating was so close that nobody smoked . hope this helps non - smokers avoid a bad experience .

		there is always the buffet or room service , which delivers 24 hours a day . last but not least , the bar on the beach that we called the fish bar due to the mosaic of fish swimming was our favorite ; the bartender at night ( omar ) had a great personality and was a pleasure .

		yes the buffet food is pretty foul and in my opinion they leave meats and cheeses out too much time in the heat ( cheese taste pretty funky . . i 'd stay clear of it . . and i 'm a cheese - lover ) but other than that the food in retaraunts was pretty good .
		[0.113 0.173 0.209 0.260 0.246]
		however it 's not that comfortable eating dinner in long pants in the excessive heat and humidity . . a few are air conditioned ( mexican and japanese ) . . service i thought pretty good apart from the one guy i caught scarfing down the chicken he was supposed to be serving ( gross ) . . .

		[0.161 0.205 0.221 0.210 0.202]
		i think they were just limited with the help in most of the restuarants and that made it hard for them to cater to everyone .
		[0.343 0.273 0.213 0.088 0.083]
		at times , we ended up with the wrong food or side dish , because they did not speak english , but we did not make a stink and as long as it was edible and we liked it , we ate it .
		[0.290 0.266 0.224 0.108 0.112]

		bavaro experience we just have returned from bavaro staying there during the week of december 12-19. what we liked : grounds - well maintained beach - is usually clean and well taken care of there are opportunities to take pictures with different animals like iguana , parrots , snake , monkeys ( this was especially of interest to small kids ) .as the platinum guests we did use and liked the services of the platinum lounge : free internet , nice drinks , relaxed atmosphere , massage , and other conveniences .

		this was a quite positive aspect of the vacation . to summarize the rest of the impressions : - restaurants : we did not like any of the a la carte restaurants at all . the only one i would recommend : el pescador .
		[0.237 0.247 0.226 0.138 0.152]
		the service and food were very good and deserved a tip .
		[0.091 0.154 0.205 0.254 0.297]
		the rest of the restaurants surprised me with the lack of basic service or/and not very tasteful food .
		[0.167 0.212 0.222 0.213 0.187]
		even the garment restaurant liceys - had absolutely no concept of service .
		[0.379 0.275 0.201 0.073 0.072]
		the food , when it finally arrived , was salty .
		[0.473 0.272 0.169 0.045 0.040]
		we waited for the appetizers for at least 1.5 hours and were getting just smiles instead of food from some of the waiters when they had a minute to spare with us ( and the rest of the empty tables in this place ) .getting any drinks in the main buffet - was an interesting task .
		[0.247 0.254 0.230 0.133 0.136]
		sometimes it took 3 waiters to understand that we need one sprite drink ; sometimes this still was not enough .
		[0.404 0.275 0.198 0.069 0.054]
		even appreciating that this resort does not have the automation/technology foundation and eveyrthing is based on simple papers and writing down manual work , it is amazing how one person never knew what other wrote in the same notebook the first person was using . it absolutely felt like left hand does not have a clue what the right one does . while booking the restaraunt or having any agreement and discussion with one person , as soon as you would come 10 minutes after to continue the previous discussion - the next in a row would look a the same shared book/notebook and would have no indication at all on the previous discussion . it meant that you would need to start your explanations/orders/reservations from ground zero like you have not done this before . overall services in the resort i would rate as around 2-3 stars .
		[0.262 0.259 0.229 0.123 0.127]
		the room service was always at the time when it was not convenient to us like they were just waiting for this moment .
		[0.306 0.265 0.220 0.102 0.108]
		finally we approached the platinum lounge and specified the time for the room service .
		[0.326 0.269 0.222 0.095 0.087]
		it helped probably just for one time . the shows were low quality with spanish as the main language , not even a little attempt to have some translation into english . the kids club : no really kids activities , no english , nobody spent quality time with the kids and our kids were not impressed at all . overall : it is a beautiful resort but i 'm quite surprised with the services or lack of services on this property . would
		[0.225 0.245 0.233 0.146 0.152]
		i recommend this resort to anyone else : nope . the concept of the fundamental services approach , when everything is supposed to be geared towards the client conveniences - is definitely a foreign concept in this resort . again , if you come not from north america and are comfortable with this style of the services , you should be then fine here .
		[0.216 0.244 0.236 0.154 0.151]
		if you do come from places like canada , us where there are basic rules and standards already established : you may not be a very happy camper here !

		[0.297 0.264 0.225 0.117 0.097]
		as everyone has said , it is beautiful , its hard to top that stretch of beach .
		[0.175 0.222 0.234 0.176 0.193]

		[0.078 0.144 0.194 0.310 0.274]

		[0.263 0.251 0.223 0.130 0.133]
		we did not figure this out until the 2nd day .
		[0.527 0.261 0.150 0.035 0.027]
		never did understand why they were hiding it , since the only guests in the lounge are platinum guests . the food was typical of all inclusives . the service varied from great to awful .

		i could not keep any food in me .
		[0.438 0.269 0.184 0.057 0.052]
		i attributed it to the food at the hotel , however after reading a previous post i had another thought .
		[0.220 0.244 0.238 0.148 0.150]
		we also did the outback safari , which takes you to a ranch for lunch , and then to another ranch to sample a lot of dominican food .

		the reps .
		[0.232 0.240 0.230 0.139 0.160]

		[0.188 0.220 0.223 0.189 0.180]
		i did keep a positive attitude , i would rather be sick in paradise than at home and another plus was that this is the first vacation i came back minus a few pounds .

		beautiful , relaxing but stomach problems ! ! ! our group of 12stayed at bararo princess jan 13-20, 2007.
		[0.393 0.277 0.197 0.071 0.062]
		it was a beautiful resort , well kept but old .
		[0.074 0.137 0.195 0.284 0.310]
		the grounds were outstanding .
		[0.144 0.199 0.222 0.231 0.204]
		the beach was wonderful , our rooms were old but for the most part clean but not 5 star . six of us had stayed two years ago in a lower rated smaller resort and we did not get sick from the food .
		[0.206 0.234 0.225 0.163 0.173]
		this time 7 out of the 12 had stomach problems , and 4 were very sick .
		[0.309 0.267 0.220 0.103 0.100]
		two of the group know that they were served bad scallups at the pay extra restaurant licey .
		[0.427 0.274 0.186 0.059 0.053]
		they spit them out they tasted so bad and were very ill that night , and a week later still do not feel great !

		so be really careful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !i myself did not have a problem .
		[0.397 0.270 0.195 0.070 0.068]
		i found plenty to eat that i enjoyed . the main buffet in the lobby had many chioces and we all seemed to like it .
		[0.165 0.207 0.227 0.202 0.198]
		for dinner we ate in all the different restaurants and the food was good , the service was slow but they all had a smile and tryed to please you .
		[0.182 0.217 0.224 0.189 0.187]
		except for el pescador the service was terrible !
		[0.367 0.277 0.209 0.082 0.065]

		the staff did not care , smile or try at all .
		[0.178 0.217 0.225 0.195 0.185]
		the only one who was even friendly was the waiter for the drinks and it took him four times to get the order right but we did not mind becase he tried . all in all i had a great , relaxing vacation but i am not so sure my friends who got sick would say the same .

		great place , but bring the immodium general experience / overview : a group of us (5 in total in three separate rooms ) stayed from dec 13 to 27 2006 and had a great time overall .
		[0.159 0.213 0.234 0.200 0.193]
		the beach was beautiful , the staff were friendly and weather was great ( but did get a couple rainy / overcast days ) .
		[0.077 0.142 0.190 0.275 0.316]
		the rooms , grounds and beach were all kept clean and tidy , especially given how large the complex is .
		[0.070 0.133 0.187 0.315 0.294]
		the staff put on an outstanding christmas eve buffet that would rival some of the better ones in las vegas with incredible displays and nearly every food imaginable , including all you can eat lobster .
		[0.177 0.223 0.226 0.192 0.183]
		no complaints there . the two pools were both quite nice .
		[0.125 0.190 0.240 0.222 0.223]
		we ended up going to the quiet pool more often because it was less competitive for seating and there was no blaring dance mix '94- esque music in the latter half of the afternoon ( although at times people still dragged their screeching brats in , despite it being called the quiet pool ) .the evening entertainment events were cute in a junior high pageant kind of way .
		[0.162 0.207 0.221 0.228 0.182]
		at least they tried hard , were enthusiastic and seemed to have fun doing it .
		[0.314 0.266 0.220 0.103 0.097]
		might be best left to the kids ( or the really drunk ) .there were a few negative experiences however .
		[0.180 0.225 0.239 0.179 0.178]
		hot water was unavailable at least twice and electricity was out once for about an hour .
		[0.349 0.274 0.209 0.085 0.082]
		this was complex wide and not just our room .
		[0.261 0.257 0.221 0.136 0.125]
		and when i say no hot water , i mean that there was literally none available ( gurgling taps , not just as though they had run out ) .
		[0.301 0.264 0.222 0.106 0.106]
		the fitness facility ( gym / weight room ) was also lacking in capacity and the cardio equipment was either not functioning or of poor quality / condition .
		[0.185 0.232 0.236 0.184 0.162]
		the staff seemed pretty slack in opening on time too as we had to wait for them to open it every morning ( sometimes 20 minutes late ) .overall we would have to rate the food as being good .
		[0.222 0.243 0.233 0.144 0.158]
		the buffets offered a wide variety of food that appeared to be of good to excellent quality .
		[0.287 0.263 0.227 0.121 0.101]
		the a la carte restaurants were fair to good with service generally good to excellent .
		[0.161 0.212 0.234 0.202 0.192]
		despite the five available places to choose from , after two weeks we all were growing tired of the selection .
		[0.222 0.240 0.224 0.175 0.140]
		i suspect that is not unique to an all inclusive experience .
		[0.442 0.274 0.184 0.057 0.044]
		the red and white wines were incredibly awful and would suggest you avoid them completely .
		[0.264 0.262 0.229 0.141 0.103]
		we found the sparkling wine to be decent enough to drink by the bottle .
		[0.178 0.215 0.224 0.212 0.172]
		as others here have mentioned , we also got sick from the food for the first time in our lives .
		[0.274 0.260 0.226 0.115 0.125]
		now i would like to state that all of us are well traveled and hardly inhibited when it comes to cuisine ( local or otherwise ) .
		[0.193 0.234 0.239 0.170 0.163]
		however , all five of us had varying degrees of diarrhea .
		[0.323 0.272 0.216 0.100 0.089]
		three of us were very sick for a few days with excruciating stomach pains , fever and nausea .
		[0.313 0.270 0.219 0.103 0.095]
		one of us was stomach sick the entire time and from the sounds of the stalls next to us , we were not the only guests having these issues . vip opiniondid not go for the vip service and did not have regrets .
		[0.408 0.274 0.192 0.064 0.062]
		we spoke to people who spent the extra (30usd a day per person ) and all they seemed to get out of it was some bottles of rum / vodka ( which only goes for about 4-9usd down there anyway never mind you can just get the bartenders to fill up whatever container you want with whatever booze you want at any time , which is what we did ) .
		[0.249 0.254 0.224 0.134 0.139]
		the only other things you got out of it was a chance to eat at the fancy restaurant once a week and were able to access a vip lounge ( which was totally dead / nothing in it ) .
		[0.170 0.214 0.223 0.199 0.194]
		other perks were cigars ( again dirt cheap down there ) and robes and nightly maid service to turn down your bed .
		[0.303 0.269 0.222 0.118 0.088]
		supposedly you get a beach front view , but as far as we could tell , that did not really exist and the rooms were otherwise the same .
		[0.278 0.262 0.236 0.116 0.108]
		they did not offer any special treatment at restaurants or at the beach area .
		[0.338 0.270 0.214 0.092 0.085]
		so considering it would have been 60usd for us _per day_ we figured we could buy a lot of cigars and booze for that . tips and advice : get a room away from the sewage processing area ( i think they were around the 200's to 220's ) .
		[0.143 0.196 0.218 0.237 0.206]
		not exactly sure what was going on around there , but you sure smelled it every time you walked / drove by .
		[0.216 0.240 0.234 0.159 0.152]
		try and get a room that does not face the tram path as they can get pretty noisy and hollering drunks may wake you up at night .
		[0.234 0.249 0.231 0.141 0.144]
		not to mention everyone that goes by on the tram gets the pleasure of staring into your room ( at least that seemed to be the case ) .be sure to ask for a king size bed if that matters to you , otherwise you may get a twin .
		[0.309 0.268 0.221 0.104 0.098]
		not sure if they offer king size beds on the upper level rooms but you may try to go for it so you do not get stuck with a bunch of rowdy spaniards fighting and dancing in flamenco shoes at all hours of the morning/night .
		[0.277 0.262 0.226 0.119 0.116]
		also , be prepared for a topless beach and pool area ( i guess that means either bring extra film or stay away altogether depending on how that suits you ) .bring a decent sized drink container to take to the beach so you can have the bartender fill it up with your favorite poison so you do not need to make as many trips . if you are mobility reduced i think you would struggle here ( or at least you could likely find more accommodating places ) .
		[0.131 0.188 0.216 0.258 0.207]
		the complex is huge and the rooms have several steps inside and out . it did not seem like it would be a great singles place either and although there were some activities / infrastructure for families , you might want to see what else is out there first . bring lots of small us bills for the staff , they work really hard and long hours .
		[0.159 0.213 0.231 0.187 0.210]
		they seemed to really appreciate the small tips now and again and likely helped in us getting such good service .

		[0.202 0.229 0.234 0.162 0.173]

		[0.182 0.224 0.226 0.184 0.185]

		[0.222 0.246 0.233 0.146 0.153]
		on the other hand , the front of the house staff , front desk , bell staff , servers , bartenders , etc , need quite a bit of training on servicing the guests and making them feel welcome .
		[0.125 0.190 0.224 0.218 0.244]
		i have worked in hotel management for many years , i do look for exceptional service , which this resort did not have .
		[0.239 0.241 0.224 0.157 0.139]
		the food is definitely under par .
		[0.137 0.199 0.225 0.227 0.212]
		the buffet for breakfast and lunch by the beach was scary to say the least .
		[0.166 0.208 0.222 0.212 0.192]
		dinner at licey was nice , service here rated a little better .
		[0.138 0.198 0.232 0.217 0.214]
		the rest of the outlets are questionable .
		[0.228 0.246 0.234 0.148 0.145]

		to qualify my statements , i have travelled and stayed in resorts in the following locations : mazatlan , puerta vallarta , cancun , jamaica , cuba , and costa rica prior to this trip . pool : nice , big and lots of shade to get out of the sunbeach : one of the nicest i have ever stepped foot on .

		[0.481 0.274 0.165 0.045 0.035]

		and we both suffered from severe stomach cramping and 'the runs ' for the following 10 days . we only drank bottled water and even brushed our teeth with bottled , so we know it was not from the water . we found the drinks to be watered down ( not a huge deal ) , but the cocktails were sooooo sweet that we could not drink them .

		stick to highballs and beer if you do not want your teeth to rot and fall out . overall : i would recommend travelling to punta cana to everyone , but not this resort because of the poor food , drink and service .

		not my favorite place my family and i visited the bavaro princess from dec . 17-24 and were very surprised with our results .
		[0.378 0.276 0.203 0.078 0.065]
		check in was an adventure , we went platinum and were driven around to the platinum desk where we were told that the two rooms we reserved were not in the same building .
		[0.464 0.272 0.174 0.048 0.042]
		that was not feasible because we are travelng with our children and because no american family has more than two children ( according to apple vacations ) we had to book a room for them , this was put in the reservations , e - mailed before arrival so on .
		[0.246 0.246 0.220 0.151 0.136]
		after much grief we were put in 2 beautiful rooms near the beach 776/778.
		[0.256 0.248 0.232 0.133 0.131]
		we had no idea that you had to have an electric key to get anything in your room to work , we sat for 3hrs waiting on a key ! dinner at hispanola is really your best bet , you can always eat cheeseburger , french fries , and salad .
		[0.313 0.271 0.220 0.102 0.093]
		you never know what else you are eating , if you go to the restaurants book at 7pm so when you do not like the food you have enough time to get to the buffet .
		[0.388 0.276 0.197 0.068 0.072]
		joselo in el gaucho is the worst staff member that you can encounter , he waited on us at dinner and would only give the 5 people at our table 1 menu !

		i could 'nt have made it through the week without my trusty can of lysol , the bedspreads have a little mold around the edges , the maids do not use any type of disinfectant when they clean , the beach tools that they leave in your room are damp also .
		[0.228 0.238 0.222 0.167 0.146]

		[0.260 0.259 0.231 0.128 0.122]

		time to move or go home , i asked if we could be moved and the manager swore there were no more rooms . . . .after much fingerpointing and my demanding a refund he found 2 open rooms by surprise right on the beach ! ! ! wow . . . and guess what !
		[0.358 0.273 0.208 0.080 0.082]
		directly across from where we were staying .

		[0.262 0.252 0.229 0.125 0.133]
		going with the platinum package is not really worth the extra money because the people who did 'nt have platinum enjoyed the same ( almost ) amenities that we did , no big deal .
		[0.291 0.265 0.225 0.111 0.108]

		[0.421 0.276 0.188 0.062 0.053]

		[0.335 0.272 0.217 0.091 0.085]
		i would just rather spend extra money and buy at the resort and feel safe .
		[0.117 0.176 0.217 0.257 0.234]
		the outback safari tour is nice but way overpriced .
		[0.107 0.174 0.220 0.249 0.250]
		it is however the best food that you will encounter the duration of your stay though .
		[0.092 0.155 0.200 0.290 0.262]

		there was no explanation of where the other room was .

		a realistic summary just got back tonight from one week at the bavaro princess and since i was constantly checking this site , felt i owed a review myself .
		[0.328 0.272 0.215 0.094 0.091]
		i went along with my wife and 2 kids ( ages 5 and 3) .
		[0.251 0.253 0.231 0.133 0.132]
		the bottom line is that i was glad we stayed at this resort primarilly because it is a suite which made it relatively comfortable for a family with 2 young kids .
		[0.103 0.165 0.206 0.269 0.257]
		i felt it would be important to note my impressions relative to the reviews i had read previously . the most important issues to us were that we did not get sick or feel endangered by malaria .
		[0.313 0.262 0.211 0.122 0.093]
		fortunately , even though we drank the water which was served ( supposedly purified ) , none of us were sick .
		[0.339 0.274 0.221 0.092 0.073]
		time will tell if we come down with malaria , but we took the pills and did not see any mosquitos .
		[0.356 0.275 0.208 0.082 0.079]
		my wife did have 5 bites , but was told by another quest that had been to punta cana several times before that they were likely from very very small spiders in the beds and pose no harm .
		[0.398 0.274 0.196 0.067 0.065]
		the room from first observation was that it was a little musty but decently sized and relatively clean .
		[0.069 0.133 0.185 0.315 0.298]
		i saw one bug during my stay there which i felt was acceptable .
		[0.277 0.260 0.229 0.124 0.110]
		the pull out bed , however was the worst bed i 've ever laid on by far .
		[0.354 0.274 0.209 0.088 0.075]
		i would ask the desk to roll in a cot if you need more room . the recent hurricane was not evident to us .
		[0.236 0.251 0.231 0.139 0.143]
		yes , there were downed tress in the jungle in between the 2 main living areas , but they could just have easilly been down prioir to the summer . the food was in my opinion average to poor .
		[0.255 0.256 0.231 0.127 0.130]
		while it is true that you can always find something to eat , i felt dinner was the least enjoyable meal , because you could not as easilly get another chance , or see the food prioir to choosing it as you can at a buffet during lunch or breakfast .
		[0.167 0.210 0.221 0.211 0.191]
		for those that felt that the food is just not catered for american tastes , i say these restaurants would not fluorish anywhere by themselves as seperate entitys .
		[0.270 0.261 0.226 0.120 0.122]
		the staff however was very friendly at the restaurants , and while i was surprised how little tipping took place , i felt like i wanted to , not because i had to .
		[0.195 0.229 0.233 0.160 0.183]
		as a general rule the folks away from the main building were very warm and loving . i do agree with the previous reviewer in that the front desk folks in general were not as willing to help .
		[0.163 0.208 0.222 0.221 0.186]
		if you are someone that likes to stay connected to e - mail or voicemail while on vacation , i can tell you it is a major problem .
		[0.271 0.261 0.227 0.122 0.118]
		the only way i could do it , was by going to the main building which was a 10 min walk and then hope someone could help me .
		[0.212 0.233 0.226 0.173 0.156]
		there is a fee for online access as well as getting to an att operator for calls , which is fine with me , but to have to trek to the main building is just not right .
		[0.162 0.214 0.233 0.187 0.204]
		one other thing to understand is that punta cana schedule seems to be hurry up and wait .
		[0.466 0.276 0.170 0.048 0.040]
		several things such as massages , dinners reservations , ground transportation to the airport , were such that we were warned to be punctual only to be waiting 10 - 30 minutes when we arrived on time .
		[0.415 0.275 0.193 0.064 0.053]
		we went through apple and while i thought my travel agent was great , i felt the rep at the hotel was only interested in selling excursions and was not to be relide upon for anything . we did not run into any really rude guests , but that is always kind of the luck of the draw on any vacation .

		i did feel like i was not sure how to greet people while walking by since you never know what their native tounge is , which i think inhibits mingling . lastly , we did have vip status and were happy with it .

		stayed at the bavaro princess aug . 15-22, 2004 last year , we went to sandals royal bahamian resort and spa and we were sooo impressed .
		[0.249 0.250 0.221 0.151 0.129]
		naturally , we have very high expectations for the next resort .
		[0.187 0.208 0.263 0.183 0.159]
		so my experience at bavaro may have been tainted with constant comparisons to sandals .
		[0.446 0.274 0.180 0.055 0.045]
		in any case , here 's my review : check - in : it was done in five minutes , no sweat .
		[0.267 0.259 0.228 0.121 0.125]
		but , we were told that the rooms would not be ready until 3 p . m .
		[0.413 0.273 0.186 0.066 0.062]
		so we went to lunch and did some walking around .
		[0.253 0.249 0.231 0.134 0.133]
		around 3 p . m . we went to the counter and was told that the room would not be ready for another 35 minutes because the people left late .
		[0.508 0.266 0.157 0.038 0.031]
		i was hot and tired and was therefore very upset by the news .
		[0.213 0.242 0.235 0.164 0.146]
		they offered us another room but i was not about to pass up on the room we were waiting for .
		[0.376 0.270 0.206 0.077 0.071]
		so we waited .
		[0.412 0.272 0.192 0.067 0.057]
		when the 35 minutes was up , we went back to the counter with renewed hope only to be told to wait another 20 minutes !
		[0.525 0.261 0.151 0.034 0.028]
		i was sooo mad by then !
		[0.370 0.277 0.197 0.093 0.064]
		so we walked to the front and found our luggage exactly where we left it three hours earlier .
		[0.237 0.246 0.224 0.157 0.136]
		only then that we were told that we could go to our room .
		[0.605 0.237 0.120 0.020 0.018]
		what a nightmare !
		[0.239 0.250 0.225 0.153 0.134]
		it probably would not have been so bad if it was not so hot ! resort : at 96 acres , bring comfy sandals and plan to walk a lot ( in spite of the trams provided for transportation as empty seats are hard to come across at peak times ) .
		[0.143 0.196 0.219 0.244 0.197]
		be warned that the only place that has air - conditioning is your room and that people smoke everywhere ! - including restaurants and pools !
		[0.302 0.266 0.223 0.107 0.102]
		other than that , it is absolutely beautiful !
		[0.109 0.170 0.213 0.241 0.267]
		it 's very clean and the landscaping is impeccable . staff : most are good and very respectful .
		[0.036 0.092 0.156 0.305 0.410]
		but the friendliest bunch are the maids , bartenders and waitstaff .
		[0.202 0.234 0.225 0.188 0.151]
		a dollar or two will get you an even more superb service the next time they see you . pool : large and clean .
		[0.190 0.224 0.227 0.171 0.188]
		it can be overcrowded , but i like it that way because it gives it a lively feeling .
		[0.131 0.190 0.214 0.227 0.238]
		there were a lot of shallow ends - perfect for the little ones .
		[0.071 0.138 0.189 0.294 0.308]
		the swim - up bar had the best pina coladas .
		[0.151 0.209 0.222 0.220 0.197]
		but if you want chairs , get up between 7 and 8 and hang your towels on your chosen spot , otherwise , good luck finding any for the rest of the day !
		[0.149 0.200 0.219 0.239 0.193]
		same with the beach area . beach : it was packed with topless women of all shapes and sizes .
		[0.284 0.264 0.226 0.117 0.109]
		but it is a beautiful beach .
		[0.059 0.121 0.184 0.286 0.350]

		[0.083 0.149 0.197 0.301 0.271]

		[0.123 0.183 0.218 0.219 0.257]
		the pictures in the bavaro sites does not do it any justice .
		[0.261 0.253 0.221 0.143 0.122]
		we had minor ant problems here and there , but nothing that a quick squirt of skintastics spray could not fix .
		[0.172 0.213 0.223 0.206 0.186]
		but the smell in the washroom could be gross sometimes .
		[0.213 0.236 0.225 0.171 0.154]
		i think it 's the pipes linking to the sink .
		[0.267 0.258 0.231 0.130 0.115]
		the sheets were not bad but i religiously sprayed it with febreeze before each use and it helped a lot .
		[0.249 0.254 0.232 0.133 0.133]
		the mini - bar in the vip was stocked daily .
		[0.220 0.239 0.227 0.176 0.138]
		and any services required for the room was met in an instant .
		[0.180 0.223 0.228 0.180 0.189]
		our maid was jocelyn and she was a very sweet lady .
		[0.209 0.235 0.227 0.173 0.157]
		we always got extra towels , extra bottled water and always got our room cleaned early . bars : i only went to the one at the lobby and the swim - up bar in the main pool .
		[0.251 0.251 0.230 0.132 0.136]
		and let 's just say that it 's a complete waste of time to go to the one in the lobby .
		[0.201 0.229 0.226 0.168 0.177]
		and if you 're a smoker , you can buy cigaretttes for a cool dollar at the swim - up bar .
		[0.103 0.169 0.210 0.243 0.275]
		gift shop : can you say rip - off ?
		[0.302 0.269 0.228 0.113 0.088]
		the lady tried to charge us $25 us for a normal bottle of sunblock ! restaurantsbella pasta : i was expecting a good selection of pastas .
		[0.280 0.260 0.226 0.122 0.111]
		well , i only had two to choose from everyday and it was the same sauce everyday - alfredo and tomato and no meat whatsoever .
		[0.243 0.255 0.232 0.139 0.130]
		the rest were fruits , vegetables and pizzas . mac princess : tasty chicken and beef burgers .
		[0.213 0.248 0.235 0.172 0.132]
		but please do tip the poor guy ( a dollar will do ) that spends 12 hours a day in front of the hot grill everyday . el gaucho : sausage was good and that 's it .
		[0.205 0.239 0.233 0.156 0.166]
		steak was so - so . chopin : awww , i was looking forward to this restaurant since it got so many great reviews .
		[0.152 0.208 0.236 0.195 0.209]
		my personal review for it ?
		[0.309 0.268 0.227 0.108 0.087]
		it sucked and it 's totally over - rated . la hispaniola : this is the only restaurant open for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
		[0.141 0.201 0.226 0.210 0.222]
		but do get up early since it closes at 10 a . m .
		[0.131 0.190 0.215 0.270 0.193]
		try the smoothies and donuts .
		[0.170 0.207 0.237 0.186 0.200]
		licey : we had reservations as part of vip package .
		[0.477 0.255 0.187 0.048 0.033]
		but what good would it do for anyone with children if you ca not bring your kids with you ?
		[0.219 0.237 0.232 0.152 0.160]
		our daughter is 2. what were we supoosed to do with her ?
		[0.441 0.274 0.180 0.054 0.051]
		so we skipped it altogether . tourists : it was a gold - mine to find people who spoke english !
		[0.335 0.276 0.213 0.098 0.078]
		the majority are europeans ( like many people said in here ) and i experienced first - hand just how rude these europeans are .
		[0.266 0.261 0.230 0.126 0.117]
		it 's like they own the place !
		[0.241 0.245 0.232 0.137 0.145]
		and not once have i ever heard anyone who has knocked me over or cut in front of me say the words sorry or excuse me - even in their language ! vip package : - did not get bathrobes , but got lots of extra towels - steps to the main pool and beach - massage was good , but it was hardly relaxing what with the sound of the tram , people walking by and the lawnmower going off in the background . for us , just being near the pool , having extras of everything and having nightly turn - down service was worth it . check - out : easy as 1-2-3. overall , this resort is perfect in some ways , but it could be better in many other ways .

		beautiful bavaro we just arrived back from a beautiful week in the dominican march 20th .
		[0.322 0.270 0.212 0.103 0.093]
		the bus ride to the hotel from the airport was 35 minutes .
		[0.161 0.206 0.222 0.212 0.199]
		check - in went well .
		[0.234 0.243 0.244 0.140 0.138]
		the rooms are beautiful and spacious .
		[0.032 0.084 0.146 0.341 0.397]
		the beach is absolutely gorgeous .
		[0.119 0.182 0.220 0.244 0.235]
		it takes a day to get familiar with the layout of the resort and the bus schedule .
		[0.279 0.264 0.226 0.121 0.109]
		we missed breakfast 4 days out of the week because they close at 10am in the main buffet .
		[0.331 0.271 0.216 0.094 0.086]
		do yourself a favor and wake up a little earlier becuase the beach shack has nasty food .
		[0.229 0.247 0.238 0.155 0.130]
		we strongly suggest that you spend a little extra money and sign up for the vip .
		[0.273 0.261 0.232 0.125 0.109]
		this was the best decision we could have made - no lines for dinner reservations , top shelf liquor , free massage and horeseback ride ( which was the most fun ) and a free dinner at the most romantic place to eat . . . licey .
		[0.121 0.181 0.213 0.258 0.228]
		as for the other restaurants , chopin was horrible for dinner as it was full of bugs and flies .
		[0.300 0.266 0.222 0.108 0.104]
		the main buffet is better than some of the restaurants that you need a reservation for .
		[0.199 0.228 0.232 0.161 0.180]
		if you like casinos , a bus will pick you up after 7 everyday and bring you to the next resort .
		[0.204 0.230 0.224 0.185 0.158]
		the grounds are well kept as well as the rooms .
		[0.065 0.128 0.188 0.288 0.331]
		the hospitality of the workers was tremenous and a little tip goes a long way .
		[0.099 0.163 0.205 0.285 0.248]
		the hotel has a flea market once a week , buy your souvenirs there .
		[0.125 0.191 0.225 0.222 0.237]
		or , if you are willing to bargain , there are vendors on the beach - - a 25 minute walk in either direction .
		[0.073 0.139 0.191 0.314 0.284]

		[0.169 0.212 0.222 0.213 0.185]

		[0.066 0.130 0.184 0.320 0.299]
		also the catamaran day tour - long day - 13 hours .
		[0.122 0.182 0.214 0.267 0.215]
		our son found the day long .
		[0.342 0.271 0.218 0.093 0.076]
		it 's more for adults as there was not any children there .
		[0.163 0.211 0.231 0.187 0.208]
		all in all punta cana is always beautiful , but look for a smaller resort if you want the true hospitality of the people and their warmth .

		[0.295 0.265 0.226 0.111 0.102]

		[0.286 0.258 0.218 0.145 0.093]
		we do not like the dominican republic , 2. both the good and bad reviews are accurate to some degree , 3. bavaro princess and the dominican republic ( dr ) are surely fine for some , and 4. we wo not be going back to bavaro princess or dr .

		[0.220 0.241 0.233 0.142 0.163]

		[0.177 0.218 0.236 0.172 0.198]

		nice hotel - with a few faults i chose the casablanca from the good reviews on this site .
		[0.023 0.067 0.128 0.356 0.427]
		my british in - laws had never been to new york and we thought what better way to do it than place them in the middle of it in times square .
		[0.191 0.228 0.235 0.161 0.185]
		overall , we had a good stay with a few notable exceptions : 1) the pull out bed in our suite was absolutely atrocious .
		[0.191 0.230 0.235 0.166 0.178]
		the middle sagged so much that with two people in the bed , you would both slide into a crevice .
		[0.156 0.204 0.219 0.207 0.214]
		those mattresses need to be changed asap !
		[0.478 0.267 0.173 0.048 0.033]
		why advertise a suite with a pull out bed when this pull out bed is so useless ?
		[0.278 0.266 0.242 0.117 0.098]
		of course , we could not move since the hotel was sold out .
		[0.334 0.270 0.215 0.093 0.088]
		2) the so - called free wireless '' never worked .
		[0.281 0.260 0.224 0.124 0.111]
		we were told to call the it department and were on the phone with this person for 45 mins and in the end it never worked .
		[0.363 0.277 0.206 0.079 0.075]
		i kept calling the front desk and they said it was a problem in the entire building - from the reviews here , it seems the wireless rarely works .
		[0.160 0.212 0.222 0.203 0.203]
		3) yes , there is a computer you can use in the lounge but there always seemed to be someone on it , so when you needed to check on an address or something , you could not .
		[0.190 0.228 0.232 0.160 0.188]
		there should be a posted sign about a 20 minute maximum , especially when others need to use the computer .
		[0.195 0.234 0.236 0.172 0.163]
		the good things :1) great breakfast ( as long as you do not need a huge american style spread ) and hot drinks always available ( and daily newspapers ) 2) nice wine  cheese in the evening .
		[0.037 0.091 0.152 0.352 0.369]

		[0.046 0.107 0.172 0.310 0.366]

		[0.310 0.269 0.220 0.099 0.102]

		a fine hotel we opted for the cruise special - $160 per room per night ( not currently available on their website but similar to their current summer value package ) .
		[0.080 0.145 0.194 0.316 0.265]
		we stayed 2 nights ( may 11- may 13) before flying back to boring england ( nobody ever left their heart there ) .there was a mix - up involving our pick - up from the cruise terminal which was quickly resolved .
		[0.151 0.209 0.222 0.216 0.202]
		a compensatory bottle of wine was waiting for us in our room .
		[0.199 0.228 0.233 0.165 0.174]
		we thought this was rather generous - unneccessary but very kind all the same .
		[0.211 0.236 0.229 0.162 0.161]
		the breakfast component of the bread and breakfast package ( and i do not believe this was made clear on the website ) was worth $14 ( as is now clearly stated on the summer value package ) .
		[0.075 0.141 0.193 0.307 0.285]
		this , in contrast , we thought was rather cheap as $7 per person would not buy much at all ( three quarters of a blueberry omelette , i think ) .
		[0.184 0.227 0.233 0.169 0.187]
		after a quick chat with the front desk , this was upgraded to $28 which is sufficient for two people to indulge in one of their four ( very tasty ) breakfast packages ( e . g .
		[0.078 0.141 0.191 0.332 0.257]
		juice , tea/coffee , toast , vegetable omelette ) valued at $12-13 approx . so my only suggestion to the management is to do likewise - change your current and future packages from a $14 per room restaurant allowance to ( a more realistic ) $28. note : in the uk , bed and breakfast for any class of hotel has no such restrictions . this would be our only criticism of a deservedly top - notch hotel . previous reviews correctly report on the myriad positives - great location , excellent front desk , excellent tour desk , excellent rooms . . . . . .in fact , excellent everything .

		wow what a surprise from reading about a zillion reviews before booking a hotel for myself and my 14 yr old daughter to spend a weekend shopping at union square in sf , i was expecting a small but quaint , fairly clean room with a great location .

		[0.094 0.157 0.200 0.271 0.278]

		[0.103 0.171 0.215 0.236 0.275]

		[0.045 0.104 0.163 0.317 0.370]

		[0.265 0.258 0.227 0.123 0.127]

		[0.080 0.149 0.204 0.261 0.306]
		it really is right on the street car line and is within walking distance of china town , moma , etc . i do not know that i would stay at the chancellor in the summer ( no a/c and we never could figure out how to open the windows so it may be impossible ) , but for autumnal afternoon temperatures in the 60's and evening lows in the 50's , it was just fine .
		[0.075 0.138 0.189 0.309 0.289]

		[0.121 0.169 0.251 0.239 0.220]
		it was clean and tidy , even if the room was small ; there was enough space for us and our luggage .
		[0.076 0.139 0.190 0.295 0.300]
		my only real complaint is that it would be nice to have some color in the room - we had whitewash everywhere with the furniture  carpet providing the only relief ( i do not count the 2 tiny prints on the wall , nor do i count the wallpaper border in the bath ) .
		[0.251 0.255 0.232 0.134 0.128]

		[0.142 0.201 0.237 0.217 0.203]
		and right next door to the hotel , so you have an advantage in terms of proximity .
		[0.054 0.116 0.173 0.326 0.331]
		get there early , though ; the joint had a line 25 people deep at 8:00 a . m . ! another good breakfast place is lory 's diner ; there are , like , 5 locations within 3 blocks of the chancellor . lastly , be advised : if you 're booking this hotel through an online service like expedia or orbitz , you will not be getting the sample european - themed room with the beautiful white canopied bed that is shown on those websites .
		[0.155 0.212 0.233 0.200 0.200]

		[0.058 0.120 0.177 0.328 0.317]
		most hotel chains share the beach with the general public .
		[0.113 0.178 0.212 0.266 0.231]
		our room was a standard entry level room with partial view of the ocean .
		[0.124 0.187 0.221 0.240 0.228]
		the room was somewhat small as we could not fit the crib in there comfortably so our son slept in our bed for the two nights .

		[0.086 0.150 0.202 0.277 0.285]

		[0.207 0.234 0.238 0.158 0.163]
		there was no kiddie pool and the one and only pool was 3 feet deep all around .
		[0.227 0.241 0.226 0.150 0.156]
		unless you have an inflatable toy for your kids , you will be holding them the entire time .
		[0.323 0.270 0.220 0.094 0.092]
		i also do not think the pool was heated .
		[0.319 0.269 0.218 0.098 0.096]
		i know it 's 90 degrees , but it felt cold when you first got in .
		[0.219 0.241 0.226 0.158 0.156]
		my son did not enjoy it at all and we had to spend the morning by the pool while my husband visited with family .
		[0.307 0.264 0.223 0.106 0.100]
		we paid almost $600 per night , at that price , i would have liked to have a heated pool .
		[0.245 0.252 0.232 0.134 0.136]
		there were no playgrounds for the kids to play or an area where you can let them go wild .
		[0.189 0.223 0.222 0.191 0.174]
		there was one saving grace and that is at mares - their casual restaurant .
		[0.101 0.166 0.206 0.282 0.245]

		great mini vacation destination we chose the rcsj for its accessibility (3.5 hours from ny and no immigration lines ) and the usual exectation of high quality from the rc chain .
		[0.172 0.223 0.236 0.190 0.179]
		the hotel and staff pretty much delivered all that was expected , save for a few exceptions .
		[0.061 0.129 0.189 0.281 0.340]
		i would very much recommend the rcsj for anyone looking for a quick break in the sun from the east coast of the us . the rcsj delivered on the usual good things : friendly and helpful staff , great lobby and common areas , good dining options in the hotel , clean rooms , nice large pool and beach , great tennis courts and spa .
		[0.044 0.103 0.162 0.316 0.375]
		however , a couple of suggestions/ comments on what could be improved .
		[0.101 0.166 0.206 0.293 0.233]
		first , the outside of the hotel needs a clean up .
		[0.040 0.095 0.161 0.327 0.377]
		the parts facing the ocean need a scrubb and a new lick of paint .
		[0.078 0.142 0.193 0.311 0.276]
		second , the food options at the pool/ beach could be improved/ expanded , as it 's basically just sandwiches and salads .
		[0.117 0.178 0.213 0.276 0.217]
		we could not get our perennial favorite of guacamole and chips , which i 'd suggest they add , plus some other nibble - type food .
		[0.169 0.212 0.223 0.208 0.188]
		third , the pool and beach drinks and food service was average .
		[0.220 0.230 0.252 0.153 0.144]
		we felt that we had to keep a sharp eye out for a waitress and sometimes it would take 20-30 minutes to get the drink you had ordered !
		[0.371 0.278 0.203 0.079 0.069]
		a few more staff when it 's busy would help .
		[0.071 0.136 0.196 0.279 0.318]
		and servers should let you keep the tab open rather than expect you to close it , every time you order a drink .
		[0.258 0.253 0.226 0.135 0.128]
		finally , the room we had an ocean view ( but only just ) , was fairly small and lacked some of the basics we have enjoyed at other rc hotels ( such as dual sinks and a separate shower cubicle ) .
		[0.142 0.201 0.230 0.198 0.228]
		while the hotel layout may not accommodate such large rooms , it just did not feel quite up there with other rc 's we have visited . all in , we had a really good time .
		[0.167 0.216 0.236 0.187 0.195]
		it is the perfect location for a quick weekend in the sun and , with a few relatively minor improvements , the experience could have been outstanding rather than just very good .
		[0.037 0.095 0.153 0.319 0.395]

		the classiest hotel in san juan my husband and i stayed at the ritz ( with another couple ) from june 25th to the 29th , and for the most part found this resort to be excellent .
		[0.123 0.184 0.214 0.216 0.262]
		first of all , the hotel itself is quite pretty , with the lobby area greeting you with full views of the pool area through floor - to - ceiling glass windows about two stories high .
		[0.096 0.165 0.213 0.248 0.279]
		the pool area was very nice and we did not have any problems finding 4 lounge chairs on our own , or on saturday and sunday with the help of one of the pool attendants ( never neglecting their gratuity , of course ) .
		[0.134 0.189 0.216 0.245 0.216]
		my husband and his best friend really enjoyed the beach and commented how clean and pleasant it was .
		[0.133 0.195 0.228 0.212 0.232]
		we celebrated my husband 's 29th birthday on sunday and found the sunday brunch at the caribbean grill excellent , and our waiter even made us a special array of desserts with a candle and a personalized birthday wish .
		[0.182 0.222 0.224 0.211 0.161]
		we also got a chance to have some services at the spa , which was fine but not what you 'd expect from the ritz carlton chain .
		[0.089 0.153 0.201 0.278 0.279]
		as far as food is concerned , we ate at both the restaurant by the beach ( ca not remember the name ) and the caribbean grill and found the food well prepared and delicious .
		[0.084 0.148 0.198 0.291 0.278]
		previous reviews have mentioned prices to be high , which may be somewhat true if you do not keep reminding yourself that you are on vacation and that these prices are somewhat expected for any high - end resort .
		[0.181 0.224 0.239 0.183 0.173]
		if you are in san juan you really have your pick of some really good food , we visited several restaurants and found la piccola fontana ( in the wyndham el san juan ) , ajili mojili ( in condado ) , casa borinquen and dragonfly ( both in old san juan ) all to be excellent , and all with such different flare ! .apart from housekeeping which was somewhat inconsistent , the service at the ritz is excellent .
		[0.086 0.155 0.206 0.243 0.310]

		[0.040 0.096 0.156 0.354 0.354]
		now on to our only problem with our stay , from our first walk into our balcony room ( # 354) we noticed an awful mildew or mold - like smell .
		[0.328 0.271 0.211 0.098 0.093]
		the room was very well appointed and of a nice size , and this lingering smell seem to be coming from the carpet .
		[0.110 0.176 0.218 0.232 0.263]
		on our second day we called housekeeping to ask if something could be done about the smell and because we noticed that the carpet had not been vacummed since we got there .
		[0.439 0.273 0.182 0.056 0.050]
		the lady on the phone was very polite and apologetic and within 10 minutes there was a housekeeper at our room , vacum in hand and with a very strong but pleasant room deodorizing spray .
		[0.062 0.126 0.181 0.328 0.303]
		the smell persisted and on our last night there we were awaken by a big leak in the ceiling in the entrance area .
		[0.175 0.222 0.234 0.174 0.196]
		engineering came to our room about twenty minutes after our phone call to guest services and without even coming into our room , which obviously shows that they were previously aware of this problem , informed us that it would be taking them a very long time to deal with the problem and that we should call the front desk and have our room switched .
		[0.426 0.276 0.187 0.059 0.052]
		after packing , we were moved to the 7th floor and our room ( # 757) was spotless .
		[0.223 0.250 0.245 0.145 0.137]
		we were allowed a 3 o 'clock check out after reminding the front desk of our switch , but no one offer any apologies furthermore .
		[0.340 0.275 0.204 0.100 0.081]
		in closing , i hope that this review has been helpful and as for us we would actually stay at the ritz carlton san juan in the future , but would request to be moved immediately if upon entering the room we find ourselves unhappy .

		very nice for what it is : an urban resort we have just returned from a four - day stay at this hotel .
		[0.085 0.148 0.202 0.263 0.302]
		the previous reviews of this and other san juan hotels left us puzzled , so i thought i 'd try to provide the straight scoop .
		[0.122 0.186 0.223 0.219 0.250]
		this is a very fine urban resort hotel , with a pleasant beach attached as a bonus .
		[0.034 0.086 0.147 0.357 0.376]

		[0.045 0.104 0.163 0.360 0.328]
		as an added bonus , the hotel is a pleasant five - minute walk from the el san juan , which has fabulous nightlife in its elegant lobby .
		[0.034 0.090 0.156 0.328 0.392]
		but : this is not the caribbean resort of your dreams - - it is basically urban .
		[0.243 0.251 0.231 0.132 0.143]
		if you need or want to stay in san juan itself ( as we did ) this is beyond any dispute the finest choice you could make .
		[0.104 0.167 0.206 0.264 0.259]
		( the closest competitors in san juan , such as the marriott or the water club , are pale imitations of the ritz and nowhere near as nice . )
		[0.071 0.134 0.186 0.303 0.305]
		however , puerto rico does offer many other high - end beach resorts some distance away - - typically , 1-2 hours drive outside of san juan .
		[0.045 0.103 0.163 0.353 0.335]
		if you 're looking for a typical luxury caribbean resort , you may be happier at one of those choices ( horned dorset , wyndham in farjado , etc . ) .
		[0.098 0.161 0.203 0.285 0.252]
		if you have already decided in stay in san juan itself , howver , the ritz is absolutely your best choice .
		[0.057 0.120 0.185 0.296 0.341]
		btw , if you 're in san juan , go for dinner at pikayo - - rated , for good reason , as one of the top 100 restaurants in the world for 2003.

		[0.175 0.215 0.224 0.217 0.168]
		examples include facades in need of painting , the hot tub sans bubbles ( no plan to fix i guess ) , floors needing cleaning , pools which could also be cleaner? ? i truly think this is an economic related numbers issue - as occupancy is surely down .
		[0.277 0.263 0.231 0.127 0.102]
		we laughed as the walk to the lower pool had dirt/hair balls the whole 6 days that just blew around and were never swept - well it is a big resort and must be a nightmare to maintain .
		[0.235 0.250 0.234 0.138 0.143]
		if you have a teenager as i do - beware as the drinking age is 18 ( not 21) .
		[0.243 0.252 0.233 0.141 0.132]
		that blew me away and my son and my friends kids bellied up to the bar and drank .
		[0.366 0.274 0.206 0.079 0.075]
		he?? 19- but i wish i had foreseen this and snuffed it out before we got there .
		[0.402 0.273 0.198 0.065 0.061]
		plus they had no problems freely serving my 17 year old either .
		[0.398 0.277 0.189 0.083 0.054]
		scary stuff as a parent .
		[0.235 0.232 0.258 0.155 0.120]
		every guest gets these charge cards - i wonder if they have a way to restrict them ?
		[0.446 0.275 0.179 0.055 0.044]

		[0.096 0.161 0.204 0.299 0.239]
		what else ? well we ended up not doing the luminescence tour in the kayaks - but figured out if you walk around the corner ( to the left of where you get on the boat ) - is ? the cost as opposed to booking through the resort ( $44 versus $88 or something like that ) .
		[0.212 0.240 0.232 0.150 0.166]
		my other tip is the lower pool - kind of hidden but very relaxing versus the noisy upper pool .
		[0.108 0.179 0.220 0.249 0.244]
		you know they have this water park - but our kids were maybe a little too old for it and i guess the $20 cost put them off ( versus them sneaking daiquiris - go figure ) .

		one night we ate at blossoms ( japanesse place ) and it was $160 for 3 people and 1 glass of wine - way over board for mediocre food . when we return next year , we will plan to have dinner off property more often until the hotel gets the hint . we did have a great time and the room we had ( las brias wing ) was clean , spacious and very comfortable .

		el conquistador , puerto rico if you go in a large group , you must ask the waiters in the restaurant to give you individual checks before you start , or when you make your reservation . the restaurants in the hotel will charge you extra for bottled water , but the local tap water is fine .

		overall , the resort is beautiful .
		[0.092 0.151 0.206 0.262 0.290]
		there is the private beach which is a short ferry ride away .
		[0.049 0.110 0.173 0.325 0.343]

		[0.071 0.134 0.190 0.301 0.303]

		[0.241 0.250 0.232 0.134 0.144]

		[0.085 0.151 0.197 0.300 0.267]
		there was a bakery/internet cafe , that had only 2 computers , which for the size of the resort was clearly insufficient . the restaurants were ridiculously overpriced , a single scoop ice cream cone was $5.
		[0.124 0.183 0.214 0.262 0.217]

		we didnt eat a single thing at the resort .
		[0.342 0.270 0.214 0.095 0.079]
		we also rented a car for our stay and the parking was $15-20 per day . the front desk was kind enough to tell us to use our cell phones because the phone usage was like 9 dollars a minute .
		[0.190 0.230 0.233 0.170 0.177]

		good for a weekend of sun just spent a long weekend ( thurs ~ mon ) at the el conquistador in puerto rico .
		[0.032 0.083 0.144 0.366 0.375]
		i read a few of the reviews here on tripadvisor , and have to say they were mostly accurate and very helpful in managing my expectations . the hotel is huge ( close to 1,000 rooms , several buildings ) and does cater heavily to corporate groups .
		[0.110 0.176 0.209 0.244 0.261]
		during my stay , there were bankers and insurance agents .
		[0.238 0.248 0.234 0.137 0.143]
		it does offer all the horrors of an over - built , extremely touristy place with the expected customer base .
		[0.114 0.176 0.211 0.270 0.229]
		my room in the main building was not bad - - essentially a low - end hyatt/sheraton type set up , but certainly no bedbugs ( mattresses are encased in a sturdy looking cover ) or dank bathrooms .
		[0.216 0.243 0.233 0.154 0.153]
		housekeeping was decent too .
		[0.170 0.215 0.240 0.211 0.164]
		and just as most of the reviewers on tripadvisors said , the employees are friendly/helpful , and the place is big enough to escape whatever scene you want to avoid .
		[0.165 0.215 0.223 0.195 0.203]
		yes , the food is not cheap , but they have enough restaurants on premise to choose from , hi - end to mid - range .
		[0.144 0.197 0.218 0.226 0.215]
		what 's weird is things like bottled water have a wide price range depending on where you buy it .
		[0.170 0.220 0.235 0.205 0.170]
		beyond price , you ca not come here thinking you 're in for a gastronomic treat .
		[0.167 0.218 0.244 0.199 0.172]

		[0.092 0.154 0.198 0.274 0.280]
		for me , the best part was the access to their 'private ' island ( i doubt they really own it . . . it also allows non - hotel guets to visit especially if they come by their own boats ) via high - speed boats that simply go back and forth from 9 am till 5:30 pm .
		[0.179 0.217 0.224 0.216 0.164]
		similar to the hotel , even though it 's a small island with limited beach real estate , you can still find a way to 'escape ' the mob .
		[0.109 0.164 0.237 0.243 0.247]
		a quick hike up and then down a dirt road leads you to a completely deserted patch of beach ( there are two such 'coves ' as indicated on the island map ) , where i was every day .

		wife and daughter used the spa once which they enjoyed . we did not spend time at the main pools which were quite crowded and more of the 3.5 to 4 star ambience .
		[0.202 0.235 0.234 0.162 0.167]

		[0.016 0.054 0.113 0.404 0.413]
		yes it takes awhile to get there , its an island out in the ocean .
		[0.147 0.203 0.225 0.209 0.216]
		the boats were modern and fast . food was about what we expected , we alternated breakfasts between the cafe caribe ( coffee shop ) in the lobby and the las brisas buffet .
		[0.094 0.159 0.203 0.282 0.263]
		prices in the cafe were pretty reasonable for basic breakfasts .
		[0.027 0.078 0.139 0.378 0.378]
		buffet was high at $25 , although we enjoyed the great fruit and omlettes and ate enough to skip lunch . the fresh local catch at stingray 's ( dorado and tuna ) was excellent and we went there twice for the same thing .
		[0.101 0.171 0.218 0.243 0.266]
		the other hotel restaurants did not appeal to us and appeared pretty expensive .
		[0.272 0.260 0.229 0.124 0.115]

		[0.199 0.219 0.209 0.177 0.197]
		ok , i felt compelled to check back on this site to see what had been written laterly , and really felt compelled to post another opinion based on our stay . we went to el conquistador december 26 - jan 1.
		[0.163 0.207 0.221 0.239 0.170]
		our experience was remarkably different from most overall , but consistent in some areas . . . .we do christmas week in the caribbean every year and have somehow become accustomed to overpaying for our hotel , but this is always the best time for us to travel with our 7- year old who is in school . we had a great time !
		[0.134 0.189 0.215 0.242 0.220]
		the resort was packed with families , many from the northeast .
		[0.261 0.258 0.231 0.135 0.116]
		the vibe during the whole week was very enthusiastically holiday , and fun . here are some specifics : - - - our hotel room was great , actually .
		[0.098 0.163 0.212 0.235 0.290]
		they upgraded us from garden view to partial oceaan view .
		[0.181 0.218 0.225 0.219 0.157]
		yes , they are renovating , but they are doing one entire wing at one time , which is not seen by those stayin at the hotel .
		[0.124 0.182 0.213 0.252 0.228]
		a new wing is being consteucted , but it does not get in the way of any view or walking path in the entire resort .
		[0.170 0.219 0.234 0.180 0.198]
		our room was clean , well taken care of by housekeeping .
		[0.208 0.232 0.234 0.161 0.165]
		many new room amenities - coffee maker , refrigerators , blowdryers , sound system , etc .
		[0.041 0.099 0.159 0.366 0.336]
		little things , but they are definitely trying to update the rooms as quickly as possible .
		[0.132 0.196 0.229 0.215 0.228]
		it appeared that all our towels and bedding ( down comforters and duvet ) were brand new .
		[0.138 0.193 0.219 0.244 0.207]
		- - - they brought us happy holiday gift basket the first night with lots of local treats and snacks , it was very nice . - - -
		[0.062 0.125 0.179 0.324 0.311]
		on the first day at palomino island , we did need to wait for about 25 minutes for a ferry , but it was because the line for transport to the island was so long , and they limit the number of passengers on each ferry .
		[0.092 0.156 0.200 0.287 0.264]
		the ferry consistently ran every 20 - 30 minutes , and we watched as they tested new 8- minute ferry boats which will be used soon . - - -
		[0.187 0.227 0.229 0.187 0.170]
		palomino island was gorgeous , and quite busy each day .
		[0.063 0.119 0.195 0.329 0.293]
		the first two days after christmas were packed - not many available chairs ( and there are hundreds ) but after that , the crowds slimmed down .
		[0.157 0.204 0.222 0.227 0.191]
		they had wait staff bringing lunch and drinks to your chairs , had bands , and organized volleyballs games , even a sand castle contest for the kids on our last day . we even rented a car to try out other local beaches ( loquillo ) and the rain forest .
		[0.118 0.178 0.211 0.264 0.228]
		we left and went back to palomino . - - -
		[0.206 0.227 0.227 0.176 0.164]
		there was only one time one of the funiculars going down to the marina area was broken and it was fixed within 15 minutes .
		[0.178 0.215 0.222 0.210 0.175]
		if you have thousands of people taking anything up and down or back and forth 24/7 there will be problems .
		[0.204 0.229 0.224 0.192 0.151]
		and the staff quickly fixed it . - - -
		[0.075 0.140 0.193 0.272 0.320]
		we agreed with everyone else that the restaurants were just ridiculously over - priced .
		[0.338 0.272 0.215 0.096 0.079]
		just outrageous .
		[0.241 0.247 0.233 0.172 0.108]
		food was ok .
		[0.257 0.255 0.230 0.146 0.111]
		we went to otello 's ( just ok ) , stingray ( our best meal there ) and strip house ( ok ) .
		[0.082 0.146 0.196 0.308 0.268]
		we 're lucky to live in a city with great restaurants and have pretty high standards .
		[0.061 0.126 0.188 0.302 0.323]
		so we were disappointed by the food for the price , but we took another reviews advice and bought food for snacks and breakfast .
		[0.079 0.143 0.195 0.292 0.291]
		they should have kids ' meals at kids ' pricing .
		[0.176 0.219 0.224 0.216 0.165]
		$12 for buttered bow tie pasta is just manslaughter .
		[0.202 0.232 0.234 0.165 0.167]
		yes , i am embarassed to say that we paid that but sometimes on vacation you are irrational and say what the hell .
		[0.365 0.273 0.206 0.078 0.078]
		some nights we just ordered a pizza .
		[0.094 0.162 0.212 0.264 0.268]
		we ate outside the resort and the hotel has a list for you to try .
		[0.107 0.171 0.219 0.238 0.265]
		we ate at con pepe ( i think that 's the name ) near the entrance ot the westin and it was amazing , and much more reasonable . - - -
		[0.083 0.151 0.199 0.260 0.308]
		in general , the pricing for snacks , candy and drinks , even at the convenience store there , was about 4 times what you would expect to pay , even at the local stores ( $3.99 for a bag of lays chips already marked as $1.39.
		[0.148 0.207 0.229 0.202 0.214]
		$ 3.89 for usa today .

		[0.186 0.224 0.244 0.171 0.175]
		- - - our daughter did not do the kids ' club , but we heard glowing reviews and the first few days there were about 20 kids in teh club participating in activities .
		[0.156 0.203 0.219 0.218 0.203]
		each night they had movies and other games to keep kids busy .
		[0.291 0.268 0.227 0.116 0.098]
		we were lucky to hook up with parents who had kids of similar ages , so making friends while there was not a problem for our 7- year old . - - -

		[0.262 0.254 0.230 0.128 0.126]

		great place to relax and enjoy the resort my wife and i stayed at the el conquistador for our 1 year anniversary oct 1st -6th .
		[0.118 0.182 0.210 0.239 0.251]
		we read all the reviews prior to taking our trip so alot of it was expected .
		[0.154 0.205 0.233 0.205 0.203]
		i think in general , all the reviews are accurate . weather - near the end of hurricane season , we were somewhat worried about the weather , but it was 85-90 each day partly cloudy .
		[0.163 0.214 0.222 0.207 0.193]
		when the sun was out , it was hot , there was a breeze by the pool and also on the island . food - the food is expensive .
		[0.109 0.168 0.209 0.252 0.262]
		$10-15 for a burger , $25-45 for a dinner entree .
		[0.112 0.177 0.216 0.231 0.264]
		however , the food is good quality .
		[0.089 0.154 0.211 0.260 0.285]
		actually the breakfast at the caribe cafe was priced pretty well $6-9 for entrees , and the coffee shops had bagels , muffins that we priced ok .
		[0.047 0.105 0.165 0.374 0.309]
		so you could start the day off with a good meal and a good price .
		[0.058 0.119 0.180 0.307 0.336]
		we did not do the buffett at las brisas , as it was closed ( i think it was $20 a person anyhow ) .we found the ballyhoo bar and grill at the marina to have the best lunch menu and moderate prices .
		[0.100 0.163 0.205 0.284 0.248]
		the burgers , sandwiches and quesadillas were all good .
		[0.059 0.123 0.179 0.329 0.311]
		the main grill on palomino was closed and the secondary grill was ok , but the prices were higher .
		[0.098 0.162 0.206 0.278 0.255]
		alot of people have said good things about the pizza at the pool , but we did not think it was too good .
		[0.203 0.233 0.239 0.160 0.165]
		dinner at otellos ( italian ) was very good .
		[0.084 0.149 0.209 0.262 0.295]
		dinner at blossoms ( chinese ) was ok .
		[0.062 0.129 0.184 0.358 0.268]
		i think if they just lowered some of their prices $5- $10, they 'd have no complaints .
		[0.197 0.225 0.227 0.178 0.172]
		hotel - as with others at this time , we were in the la vistas section , we originally had a garden view , but they gave us a free upgrade to an ocean view , which overlooked the main pool/ocean and with a nice balcony .
		[0.114 0.179 0.216 0.233 0.258]
		the sunrise comes up on this side .
		[0.172 0.213 0.225 0.203 0.187]
		the room itself was in need of an upgrade .
		[0.136 0.194 0.227 0.213 0.229]
		just older stuff , it would be a nice room with renovations .
		[0.109 0.177 0.220 0.238 0.255]
		they are doing major renovations to other parts of the hotel ( bristas wing ) so i assume , they 'll upgrade this one once the other is done .
		[0.220 0.243 0.228 0.154 0.156]
		renovations of rooms and a waterpark are said to be completed in 2006-2007.
		[0.164 0.199 0.262 0.208 0.167]
		they are also updating their boats .
		[0.428 0.273 0.189 0.067 0.043]
		in the offseason , it definately is a much more laid back hotel .
		[0.038 0.093 0.153 0.336 0.379]
		it 's like you have it to yourself , so it 's quiet .
		[0.049 0.108 0.169 0.315 0.358]
		some of the restaurants are closed , since there are not that many people but there are still plenty of choices .
		[0.201 0.232 0.234 0.160 0.173]
		we spent a day by the main pool and that was nice , as we were close to our hotel room , and also close to the pool bar and servers .
		[0.147 0.202 0.229 0.189 0.232]
		we also found the infinity pool in the casitas , and that was a great view as well .
		[0.033 0.084 0.145 0.353 0.385]
		i could see how these would be crowded in the main season .
		[0.223 0.242 0.233 0.154 0.148]
		i thought it was pretty easy to get around with the funicular ( tram ) to take you to the marina section and the boat to take you to palomino island .
		[0.087 0.151 0.201 0.292 0.269]
		we enjoyed the boat ride .
		[0.036 0.090 0.155 0.360 0.360]
		we spent a couple days out at palomino island .
		[0.067 0.131 0.188 0.316 0.298]
		it 's definately pretty cool to have your own island .
		[0.093 0.160 0.212 0.274 0.262]
		we took the first 9am ride out in the morning and along with a couple other people had the island to ourselves .
		[0.229 0.245 0.234 0.146 0.146]
		there are plenty of towels/chairs/umbrellas to use on the island .
		[0.068 0.130 0.190 0.293 0.319]
		it 's set up pretty well .
		[0.056 0.119 0.183 0.307 0.335]
		the water does have coral in it , so at times the bottom is rocky .
		[0.072 0.137 0.187 0.308 0.296]
		we did find a nice patch further out that became smooth sand again .
		[0.139 0.198 0.219 0.236 0.207]
		so try to go past the 1st section .
		[0.208 0.237 0.228 0.180 0.148]
		if it 's hot and you want a breeze , go right when getting off the boat ( best beach also ) .
		[0.080 0.143 0.194 0.291 0.292]
		but if the wind picks up and it get 's cloudy , stay on the left side or close to the dock ( less wind ) .
		[0.092 0.156 0.201 0.294 0.257]
		spa - my wife loved the spa .
		[0.047 0.102 0.172 0.331 0.348]
		she said it was very worth the money .
		[0.327 0.269 0.235 0.089 0.081]
		she got a 60 minute massage .
		[0.415 0.273 0.195 0.072 0.044]
		she highly recommends the services there .
		[0.329 0.266 0.221 0.102 0.081]
		she said the massage was great and the setting was perfect . golf - i guess on tues/thurs during the offseason they have discounted rates on golf after 1pm .
		[0.258 0.258 0.230 0.131 0.124]
		so it was $70 to play 18. ( they are in the processes of building a 9 hole course ) .
		[0.123 0.184 0.213 0.247 0.233]
		the golf course is really nice and all the tee boxes are positioned high , so alot of your drives will go quite a bit further 100-150 yards .
		[0.095 0.163 0.203 0.260 0.279]
		it 's pretty interesting .
		[0.048 0.110 0.175 0.336 0.330]
		the course was very well taken care of .
		[0.145 0.199 0.225 0.210 0.222]
		the fairways are pretty straight and open , so it 's an easy course to play .
		[0.100 0.167 0.212 0.247 0.274]
		lots of iguanas roaming the fairways which goes along with the views of the mountains .
		[0.079 0.149 0.196 0.299 0.277]
		all in all , this hotel is a good choice .
		[0.041 0.098 0.163 0.306 0.391]
		i think once the renovations are completed , it may be a great hotel .
		[0.045 0.103 0.162 0.348 0.341]
		in the offseason it 's a good choice for relaxing and water sports .
		[0.030 0.080 0.141 0.348 0.401]
		i would not recommend it for night life if that 's what your looking for or for socializing , as there are not many people there ( i 'm speaking about the offseason ) .but for a getaway of sun , surf , pools , golf , spa and food , it 's a good choice .
		[0.093 0.156 0.201 0.275 0.276]
		also , the staff at the hotel was very friendly and attentive .
		[0.016 0.053 0.110 0.355 0.466]
		**ps , if you connect in ny at jfk for jetblue , the san juan connection is in terminal 4, you have to take a shuttle train which can take time**

		[0.271 0.257 0.230 0.122 0.120]
		i have to say that i was very nervous with all the bad reviews of this hotel but the trip was free so of course , we took the chance .
		[0.110 0.169 0.208 0.258 0.255]
		the bus ride is a long one , but i caught a nap !
		[0.110 0.174 0.208 0.260 0.247]
		our check in was a little bit different since the resort was sold out for slah .
		[0.196 0.230 0.233 0.162 0.179]
		check in was not the greatest , we went to check in at 3:45 after standing in line for quite some time ( again , due to 1100 people checking in that day ) and was told that the room would be ready at 4pm .
		[0.351 0.273 0.212 0.083 0.082]
		i had to stand in another line to see if my room was ready and finally it was at around 4:30ish .
		[0.381 0.276 0.194 0.079 0.070]
		the bad thing is that while we waited for our room , there was not a single bar open .
		[0.306 0.265 0.221 0.104 0.103]
		we went to the casino and the guy there was very nice and went back and got us 3 beers and a pina colada on the house and urged us to complain to the front desk .
		[0.243 0.250 0.221 0.141 0.145]

		[0.049 0.109 0.179 0.294 0.369]

		[0.227 0.243 0.233 0.145 0.152]
		i would say it was average .
		[0.196 0.226 0.235 0.172 0.171]

		[0.136 0.198 0.226 0.205 0.236]
		we wised up pretty quickly and jumped in a cab the following morning to the closest grocery store .
		[0.091 0.156 0.201 0.318 0.234]

		[0.309 0.268 0.222 0.110 0.091]

		[0.121 0.181 0.224 0.233 0.241]

		[0.258 0.252 0.234 0.130 0.126]
		the conceriege did not relay this info to us but we went to ocean view .
		[0.236 0.241 0.223 0.158 0.143]

		[0.091 0.154 0.199 0.279 0.278]
		we all laughed about it later , i think we were there about 2 1/2 hours .
		[0.328 0.272 0.216 0.093 0.091]

		[0.183 0.217 0.223 0.194 0.182]

		one of my favorite resorts we just got home from this resort ( our 5th visit ) and we did notice some problems so we talked to many of the staff people and they informed us of the many new changes that are coming now that wyndham no longer owns them .
		[0.304 0.269 0.220 0.104 0.103]
		apparently , the new ownership plans to remodel every room , build a new funicular that will cut across the high hill , build a new water park for children , have an adult only pool , etc .
		[0.141 0.203 0.234 0.216 0.206]
		in two years these changes will make it the wonderful and elegant destination it 's always been .
		[0.090 0.155 0.200 0.305 0.250]
		they do not intend to raise rooms rates as they recognize that they 're high already .
		[0.442 0.276 0.182 0.056 0.045]
		they want people to get what they pay for in service and room appointments .
		[0.476 0.271 0.168 0.044 0.041]

		wonderful relaxing get - away my husband and i just returned from a 4 night stay at the el con where we had a wonderful , relaxing caribbean get - away .
		[0.107 0.173 0.219 0.242 0.259]
		based on the wide range of prior reviews , i was a bit anxious about the place but can now heartily recommend this resort to those seeking magnificent scenery and a relaxed atmosphere .
		[0.076 0.141 0.192 0.334 0.258]
		overall , we found the accommodations to be comfortable , clean , and spacious .
		[0.071 0.139 0.198 0.270 0.323]
		we were initially booked into an ocean view room in la vistas overlooking the pool area which was adequate .
		[0.084 0.151 0.197 0.296 0.273]
		however , the hotel staff were very accommodating in moving us upon request to las brisas wing to a more spacious room with a balcony providing a better view and secluded feel .
		[0.044 0.103 0.163 0.368 0.323]
		las brisas is very convenient to the main hotel area with pools , casino , restaurants , as well as to the funicular to access the marina .
		[0.068 0.129 0.197 0.279 0.327]
		yes , the furniture is a bit dated and there were just a few stains on the carpet , but easily overlooked in comparison to the positives .
		[0.062 0.131 0.191 0.300 0.315]
		in terms of service , the staff were helpful , polite , and efficient . . . but you do have to account for island time and not put yourself on a tight schedule .
		[0.095 0.162 0.202 0.259 0.283]
		we had better luck with face - to - face requests versus trying to get staff on the phone . we opted to rent a jeep at the airport and were very glad we did as it gave us flexibility to sightsee , tour el yunque rain forest on our time table ( this sight is a must for nature lovers ) , and cut down on eating expenses by purchasing drinks , wine , and snacks at a nearby grocery store .
		[0.141 0.201 0.220 0.215 0.224]
		one warning , driving in puerto rico is not for the faint - hearted .
		[0.136 0.198 0.235 0.208 0.223]
		the jeep came in very handy given the road conditions .
		[0.122 0.189 0.225 0.239 0.224]
		if you can get off property , i would highly recommend the food and service of el pasions restaurant located just down the road .
		[0.093 0.156 0.203 0.270 0.278]
		be prepared to pay resort prices for all food on site .
		[0.226 0.241 0.236 0.152 0.145]
		we did enjoy a superb seafood meal at stingrays ( at the marina ) . . .the atmosphere , food quality , and service were well worth the price . the beach at palomino island was very enjoyable and well cared for .
		[0.064 0.127 0.181 0.320 0.308]
		if you decide to snorkle , i would suggest going on the morning excursion as the afternoon anchored at only one site .
		[0.223 0.243 0.234 0.150 0.150]
		again , if you slow down and enjoy , you will not consider the boat ride over to the island or the funicular to be an inconvenience .
		[0.188 0.228 0.234 0.171 0.179]
		although we took the advice of others and closely checked our bill upon checking out , we found no inaccuracies .
		[0.230 0.240 0.226 0.165 0.139]
		this resort is not for the penny concious but i would highly recommend it to others and would go again in a heart beat .

		[0.266 0.250 0.230 0.138 0.116]
		after reading all of the reviews of the hotel , i was very excited to be able to see it first hand and give my own opinion .
		[0.172 0.219 0.236 0.178 0.195]
		i 've been in the hotel business for many years and done a lot of traveling to various places and various types of properties .

		[0.034 0.088 0.150 0.359 0.369]

		but , when tile and furnishings get older , they are hard to keep looking fresh .
		[0.263 0.259 0.230 0.131 0.117]
		we had one room with ocean view in the las vistas building and one overlooking the marina in that section .
		[0.122 0.186 0.219 0.235 0.238]

		[0.013 0.049 0.104 0.473 0.362]

		[0.137 0.190 0.219 0.227 0.227]
		we enjoyed blossoms ( asian ) , isabelas ( steakhouse ) and stingray ( seafood ) .

		[0.166 0.214 0.223 0.191 0.206]

		old , but all reviews true ! well i had changed my resort from the dorado to the conquistador and i am glad i did because it was great for my 3 yr old , but before i get into the kid aspect i will give you my most honest opinions . the conquistador is no longer a wyndham hotel its now owned by a new company ( blackstone group i think its called ) so i was a little concerned upon starting our vacation , but there was no way to know that it had changed especially since everything still said wyndham on itand they did honor our wyndham by request card !

		[0.382 0.275 0.200 0.074 0.069]
		when we reached our room there was mold everywhere the paint peeling in the bathroom and dust caked on the vents , all i could think was what kind of hole did i pick for us to vacation in ! the bellman then went to show me the armoire and the door fell off !
		[0.235 0.242 0.223 0.171 0.129]

		the good/the bad at wyndham rio mar we just returned tonight ( jan . 5th ) from an 8 day stay with our older kids ( two 20- year - olds , one 17- year - old ) from the wyndham rio mar . we joined wyndham rewards , and were upgraded to two ocean front rooms which were very spacious , with extremely comfortable beds , small flat screen tvs , and average size bathrooms that thankfully , unlike other caribbean resorts , never ran out of hot water for the shower . the hotel is on the atlantic side of puerto rico , so the water is not the calm blue/green of the caribbean .
		[0.110 0.175 0.209 0.258 0.249]
		in some ways , that was a plus , since there were gigantic waves to play in , although we all had to be careful of a considerable undertow . the beach itself is just ok .
		[0.117 0.176 0.210 0.270 0.227]
		it 's nearly two miles long , so good for a jog back and forth , but some days , especially one end of it was littered with cigarette butts and plastic cups . hotel food was mediocre to poor , except for the italian restaurant palio , and even that did not compare favorably to the most basic pizzeria in new york .
		[0.185 0.226 0.223 0.185 0.181]
		prices were high for all food except the hot dog/hamburger grill set up near the pool for lunch . luckily , we rented a car , because the hotel is in a gated community that is pretty isolated .

		overall i would rate the experience very good .
		[0.056 0.118 0.185 0.301 0.340]

		[0.225 0.236 0.226 0.161 0.153]
		( ala ritz or four seasons ) , but it certainly is far and away better than your average hotel .
		[0.074 0.142 0.196 0.271 0.317]

		[0.213 0.231 0.224 0.198 0.135]

		[0.117 0.181 0.212 0.237 0.253]
		like some other people reported , the self - parking was a little hard to find ( even in daylight ) , but that?? just because of poor signage .
		[0.216 0.240 0.233 0.143 0.168]
		it is actually in a good location , and easy to use .
		[0.018 0.057 0.118 0.349 0.458]
		not only do you save $5/day ( plus the tip you?? give to a valet ) , but i suspect that you??e probably in your car quicker than if you used the valet . on a side note , the rental car is well worth it ( we picked up our avis car at the airport - $200 ( including taxes and fees ) for 5 days ) .
		[0.079 0.143 0.192 0.305 0.281]
		when you factor in what the hotel would charge for the round - trip hotel to the shuttle ( $30 per person , each way ) , it?? not much more to have your own car ? ? especially if you want to leave the hotel for any sightseeing on your own ( rain forest , old san juan , local restaurants ) .
		[0.132 0.193 0.229 0.209 0.237]
		don?? think you can walk any place ? ? it?? probably close to two miles from the front - door of the hotel to ??own? ? (it?? probably a mile just from the front door to the main gate ) .our check - in was quick and easy , with no hassles .
		[0.163 0.206 0.222 0.211 0.197]
		i politely inquired about an upgrade ( from ocean - view to ocean - front ) , and after some discussion was given one at no charge .
		[0.201 0.232 0.223 0.168 0.176]
		the room is nothing extraordinary , but very nice ( clean , decent size , nicely decorated ) , but with a magnificent view , and a terrace with 2 chairs and a table .
		[0.025 0.071 0.131 0.374 0.399]
		it includes a dresser , a desk , flat - screen tv , cordless phone , stall shower and bathtub , mini - bar , safe , good - size closet , hair dryer , iron and ironing board , internet connection ( $14/day ) and chair/ottoman to relax in . we found the staff to be friendly , polite , professional , and eager to help ( this includes everyone from concierges to house - keeping staff ) .
		[0.085 0.150 0.197 0.304 0.264]
		however , at the concierge desk , it seemed to be hit or miss about how much they knew regarding the various tours .
		[0.183 0.220 0.226 0.212 0.159]
		we never ran into any crowds at the pool , the restaurants , or the casino .
		[0.230 0.239 0.223 0.167 0.140]
		in fact , all the facilities seemed to be pretty sparsely used , and there were even some empty tables at the casino ( black jack tables start at $5) .
		[0.177 0.222 0.226 0.185 0.190]
		of course , this is probably largely due to the fact that we went in the off - season . the hotel offers a number of tours/excursions ( snorkeling , rain forest , trip to old san juan , bio bay , etc . ) .
		[0.122 0.185 0.220 0.232 0.240]
		one of my disappointments was that info about tours was not really comprehensively presented with sufficient detail , so you had to ask a lot of questions of the concierge ( and like i said before , different people at the concierge desk seemed to have different pieces of info ) .
		[0.277 0.262 0.229 0.122 0.111]
		however , they did advise us that we could save some money by using our own car .
		[0.313 0.269 0.221 0.103 0.093]
		for example , the bio bay tour is $80 per person if you use the hotel shuttle , but we paid $52 by using our own car .
		[0.141 0.202 0.230 0.217 0.210]
		similarly , the hotel charges $38 per person for a trip to the rain forest , but if you drive yourself there is no cost ( although the visitor?? center is $3/person ) .
		[0.127 0.191 0.224 0.219 0.240]
		i did want to do snorkeling , but everything they had was a full day , and i would??e preferred something that was just 3-4 hours .
		[0.242 0.245 0.221 0.153 0.139]
		while we were there , the concierge staff kept trying to get us to attend some sort of sales - seminar ( in return for a 5- day/4- night stay at the wyndham in st . john?? ) ? ? but there was little pressure , and they stopped when we politely said ??o thanks . ? ? br/>regarding food , i would agree with the others that it is good , but nothing special , and over - priced ( probably on average of about 20% ) .
		[0.156 0.204 0.220 0.230 0.191]
		for example , whether you do the breakfast buffet or order - off - the - menu , you??l pay about $19/head .
		[0.176 0.216 0.223 0.201 0.183]
		a turkey club - sandwich was $12.
		[0.028 0.080 0.139 0.450 0.302]

		gorgeous hotel !
		[0.088 0.147 0.223 0.302 0.239]
		my husband and i , along with our three children stayed at the wyndham from aug . 18 to aug 25th .
		[0.205 0.237 0.224 0.172 0.163]
		i really love this hotel and its location .
		[0.009 0.037 0.089 0.374 0.491]
		here are some tips : i recommend that you apply for the wyndham by request program .
		[0.067 0.131 0.183 0.315 0.305]
		it provides you with various ammenities you otherwise would not get .
		[0.262 0.260 0.229 0.137 0.112]
		on this trip we were welcomed with a $45.00 bottle of wine , water for the children and some snacks .
		[0.067 0.129 0.183 0.305 0.316]
		use this program if you are traveling with small children .
		[0.198 0.234 0.238 0.173 0.157]
		by calling ahead and pushing my membership i was given a small refrigerator and microwave to use with no charge .
		[0.232 0.249 0.235 0.147 0.138]
		( if you are going to fill up the fridge , i recommend that you shop at amigo .
		[0.211 0.241 0.236 0.157 0.155]
		i thought walmart would be cheaper , but it really was not . )
		[0.062 0.124 0.179 0.318 0.317]
		we were also given a room upgade - from resort view to ocean view .
		[0.105 0.168 0.215 0.239 0.273]
		although the restauraunts @ the resort are pricey , they are worth it , especially palio .
		[0.175 0.222 0.236 0.184 0.183]
		( if you plan ahead buy yourself an entertainment book for puerto rico and there are coupons in there for restaurants ( buy one meal , get one free ) , tee times , and water sports .
		[0.081 0.146 0.195 0.315 0.263]
		also , be advised if you book through orbitz , there is a $30 resort fee , that you do not learn about until you check out your portfolio on the tv .
		[0.292 0.265 0.222 0.110 0.110]
		if you eat @ antojitos down the hill , although the food is delicious , you will wait a long time , they do not give a bread basket and any extras you order , like extra beans you will be charged .
		[0.200 0.236 0.226 0.173 0.165]
		try lolitas on rt . 3, make a left down the hill .
		[0.123 0.183 0.214 0.263 0.217]
		they have delicious inexpensive mexican cuisine .
		[0.193 0.237 0.229 0.208 0.133]
		please try the roadside huts by luquillo beach for some delicious alcapurrias and pina coladas .

		[0.113 0.173 0.208 0.256 0.250]

		[0.212 0.238 0.234 0.155 0.161]
		our room had a refrigerator that looked old , but worked fine .
		[0.166 0.209 0.224 0.216 0.186]
		in theory , there was an extra charge for using the fridge , but they did not assess it on us .
		[0.164 0.208 0.224 0.206 0.198]

		[0.022 0.068 0.128 0.367 0.415]
		the front desk was very nice and helpful during check - in and check - out and we only ate in one of the on - site restaurants ( marabella ) , but our waitress was very nice and helpful .
		[0.067 0.128 0.183 0.296 0.326]
		the two separate swimming pools are great ; one for families and one for adults only .
		[0.133 0.192 0.219 0.237 0.220]
		our adults only pool was a great place to relax .
		[0.176 0.220 0.241 0.181 0.182]
		the beach is great looking and the water is just the right temperature without being too hot or too cold .
		[0.110 0.175 0.219 0.235 0.261]
		there are tons of sand dollars living on the bottom of the ocean right there , so that was pretty cool to see .
		[0.056 0.118 0.176 0.334 0.316]
		the resort has two workers assigned to get you an umbrella and chairs for sitting on the beach , which is really nice .
		[0.158 0.210 0.224 0.200 0.208]
		the tiki bar outside is just as expensive inside with a pina colada running about $11 each .
		[0.100 0.170 0.217 0.272 0.241]
		the beach does need cleaned a bit more often to remove the cigarette butts , but if everyone was diligent about removing their own trash there would not be a problem . two complaints about the resort are parking and computer access .
		[0.154 0.213 0.233 0.197 0.204]
		the self - park garage requires you to take a ticket when you park .
		[0.113 0.181 0.214 0.258 0.234]
		take the ticket with you because you have to stop at the valet 's desk out front of the hotel to have them validate it before you can leave and take your car out of the parking lot .
		[0.201 0.233 0.236 0.158 0.172]
		we ended up paying only $20 in parking despite being there for 4 days , so i do not know how that worked .
		[0.195 0.226 0.228 0.186 0.165]
		hauling the ticket around is a pain and they should really have someone working the exit booth of the garage .
		[0.239 0.250 0.223 0.159 0.129]
		the only other complaint was computer access .
		[0.068 0.133 0.190 0.319 0.290]
		the resort has four computers set up so that you can access the internet during your stay if you do not have your own laptop .
		[0.220 0.242 0.230 0.153 0.155]
		i loved the idea , but you had to pretty much glare at the teens , pre - teens , and kids that were camped out on the computers without parental supervision .
		[0.238 0.250 0.234 0.140 0.139]
		eventually , one would disengage from facebook and let you use the computer for 3 minutes .
		[0.257 0.239 0.256 0.133 0.114]
		where were the parents of these kids ? ?we did the rainforest and liked it except for how busy it was .
		[0.208 0.237 0.237 0.161 0.157]
		lots of people everywhere .
		[0.263 0.253 0.231 0.135 0.119]
		note to travelers : wear a bathing suit to the rainforest .
		[0.196 0.234 0.227 0.203 0.140]
		we apparently did not get that memo and did not realize you could hop in whatever water you want .
		[0.459 0.272 0.176 0.052 0.041]
		it also rained twice while we were hiking and a bathing suit would have been better than a shirt and shorts .
		[0.141 0.196 0.219 0.261 0.183]
		we also did old san juan , which was cool to see , but the parking was a nightmare .
		[0.078 0.145 0.201 0.258 0.318]
		we ate at richie 's cafe up the hill from the resort and found it to be overpriced for the food , but the view is nice and they do have some authentic puerto rican cuisine on the menu .

		[0.075 0.140 0.196 0.279 0.310]

		[0.298 0.268 0.224 0.111 0.099]
		all of the restarant staff were likewise very polite and were happy to make suggestions and engage in conversation . the rooms are very adequate , although a bit on the small side .
		[0.052 0.112 0.170 0.325 0.341]
		at night , the coqui frogs will either sing you to sleep or keep you awake .
		[0.292 0.264 0.215 0.126 0.102]
		if you are a light sleeper , it would be wise to be on a higher floor . the pool area is somewhat crowded if you do not secure a spot early .
		[0.160 0.213 0.235 0.199 0.193]
		they also have a quiet pool , which seemed to have just as many fun - loving kids as the larger pool . . . so it really was not any more peaceful . the beach is nice , but the water was not the turqoise we were hoping for .
		[0.142 0.200 0.226 0.191 0.242]
		it was not crowded and was a very short walk from the pool area . the hotel has an iguana pool and has several feedings scheduled each day .
		[0.069 0.132 0.185 0.312 0.303]
		my youngest daughter enjoyed hand feeding them with lettuce supplied by the hostess . the best part of the vacation was our short drive over to the el yunque rainforest .
		[0.215 0.241 0.225 0.174 0.145]
		we spent the morning hiking on paved , well marked trails and saw some incredible vistas . our trip into old san juan was forgettable .
		[0.083 0.148 0.195 0.309 0.266]
		it may have been better if we had arranged a guided tour , but we went on wednesday , which was apparently trash day , and had to step over piles of garbage bags as we walked through the streets . both of my children thoroughly enjoyed this vacation , and my wife and i did too .
		[0.203 0.228 0.223 0.191 0.155]

		[0.049 0.108 0.172 0.302 0.369]
		it is the little things that can make a hotel stay good or bad and i have to say that the service is what makes this hotel an excellent choice for staying in ny . three of us shared a king suite room and by midwest standards it is small , but by ny standards it was spacious .
		[0.062 0.123 0.179 0.318 0.319]

		tranquill but in the middle of the action the casablanca is a great little hotel right in the middle of all the action just a few yards from times square . our room was at the rear and although we were so close to a busy spot you could not hear a thing at night , so we slept like babies . the breakfast is continental style and there is free tea and coffee all day long .

		[0.159 0.211 0.234 0.186 0.210]
		i can only say we were not disappointed and the hotel truly lives up to all the glowing reviews and more . our trip to new york was for my 40 th birthday and my trip was made extra special due to staying at this little gem of a hotel , the management even gave me a bottle of bubbly - i was really touched . all of the staff from the boys on front desk , the lovely ladies in ricks lounge and the maids were all happy , smiley and extremely polite with any requests made being promptly and effeciently met . the whole hotel exuded and air of calm and serenity , youd never believe being in such close proximity to times square .

		hoorah for casablanca !
		[0.039 0.094 0.157 0.301 0.408]
		i recently enjoyed a three night stay at the casablanca , as a sort of mini school reunion with four friends .
		[0.102 0.170 0.216 0.247 0.266]
		we chose new york , as we were travelling from london and california and it was the nearest to a halfway point we could manage .
		[0.127 0.184 0.213 0.257 0.220]
		we chose the casablanca based on recommendations from tripadvisor and i would like to add my name to the list of fans . since our group was arriving at different times and sharing rooms , i made several calls to the hotel regarding our booking .
		[0.121 0.181 0.214 0.267 0.217]
		the staff were always friendly and welcoming , no matter what time of night i called , and i would always deal directly with whoever answered the phone , rather than being put on hold .
		[0.123 0.187 0.213 0.234 0.242]
		when we checked in , it had been noted that one of us would be celebrating a birthday during our stay , and we were offered a bottle of champagne to be sent to our room , which was much appreciated . the hotel is fabulously central , just by times square and you really feel when you step outside the door that you are right in the thick of things .
		[0.099 0.161 0.203 0.273 0.265]
		on stepping inside however , you have the sense of arriving at an oasis of calm . the room were beautifully decorated and more spacious than i expected for new york .
		[0.114 0.180 0.221 0.247 0.237]
		one of the best things about the hotel is rick 's bar , which is a lounge on the second floor for guests , open 24 hours .
		[0.059 0.121 0.180 0.299 0.341]
		we were served an excellent breakfast here and in the evening from 5 to 8pm , wine and cheese is available .
		[0.064 0.130 0.191 0.273 0.342]
		now that 's what we would call a very happy hour !
		[0.287 0.256 0.221 0.119 0.116]
		the rest of the time , coffee , ( a cappucino machine , no less ) and cookies were available .
		[0.078 0.141 0.194 0.288 0.299]
		it was a great place for my friends and i to relax and catch up and there was even a pianist on the friday evening . the staff were always friendly and helpful and really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and at home .
		[0.087 0.151 0.196 0.279 0.287]
		it really was a very personal service . on the morning we checked out , we did not actually have to leave new york till about 11pm that night .
		[0.130 0.186 0.213 0.238 0.233]
		the staff very kindly took care of our bags ( even letting us have access to them in the afternoon to put away shopping ! ) and invited us to make use of rick 's bar during the day if we needed a break .
		[0.145 0.197 0.218 0.235 0.205]
		i have since learned that many hotels charge a fee to hold your bags , so we were very grateful for this service . it was great to be able to walk to the theatre , to dinner and to many other attractions and it made new york feel much smaller than it had on previous visits . next time i stay at the casablanca , i would like to try to a room at the rear of the hotel , as there is some street noise .
		[0.075 0.138 0.189 0.303 0.294]
		i know this is unavoidable in new york , but we were unlucky that the city had decided to dig up the road outside the hotel during our stay .

		a gem in times square i was intrigued by a 48- room hotel in times square .
		[0.017 0.056 0.113 0.382 0.433]
		having stayed in numerous small hotels in europe , i was prepared for smaller sized rooms . i was greeted at the front desk with my reservation information ready for initials and my luggage was whisked away by a bellman who explained everything in the room .
		[0.141 0.195 0.219 0.237 0.208]
		he encouraged me to join the wine , champagne and cheese reception in rick 's cafe . i enjoyed both the evening reception and the buffet breakfast in a room that was comfortable , open , yet private .
		[0.098 0.176 0.246 0.229 0.252]
		newspapers were in all corners and it was a generally relaxed atmosphere . i was surprise with how beautiful the appointments were in my room and by how quiet the room was .
		[0.196 0.232 0.238 0.171 0.163]
		i had stayed on the 30th floor of the marriott marquis and this 6th floor room was infinitely more quiet . i 'll be back to new york and am definitely happy that my company has added casablanca to the list of approved hotels .

		[0.251 0.253 0.230 0.134 0.132]

		chancellor is a great find - but not for everyone just returned from three nights at the chancellor and have mostly very positive things to say about the chancellor - we would definitely stay there again when returning to san francisco ( which is a wondeful city - everyone should visit ) .
		[0.038 0.091 0.155 0.340 0.377]
		the location is perfect - a few of blocks from the cable - car turnaround , across the street from union square , within walking distance of excellent restaurants and bars . . .
		[0.009 0.037 0.089 0.395 0.471]
		i could go on , but suffice it to say that for travellers and tourists , i strongly recommend it .
		[0.129 0.186 0.216 0.246 0.223]
		( a quick hint : if you 're looking for great breakfasts , go a few blocks south to cafe bellini , pick up a sandwich or danish , and enjoy some outdoor dining on the steps in union square . )although our interaction with hotel staff was relatively limited , i must give special mentiont to rory , who greeted us on arrival late friday night : in the midst of a very trying set of circumstances ( he was alone at the front desk , confronting an ever - increasing line of people waiting to be checked in , a pair of guests whose door - keys refused to work , and someone who kept calling on the phone to ask for driving directions ) , he maintained his composure and was polite and helpful throughout . as many good things as i have to say about the hotel , it is not for everyone .
		[0.152 0.208 0.225 0.201 0.214]
		i greatly enjoyed the jar of complimentary candy in our room and the free popcorn in the lobby , but some people might see these as gilding the lily .
		[0.129 0.193 0.231 0.219 0.228]
		although i 've seen the term boutique applied to the chancellor , i do not think that 's entirely accurate - to me , the term implies a hotel which has been recently renovated to offer the latest in design elements and luxury amenities .
		[0.181 0.227 0.235 0.178 0.180]
		that 's not the chancellor .
		[0.035 0.087 0.158 0.335 0.385]
		you wo not be finding a sleek bar in the lobby , or flat - screen tvs in your room - what you 're getting is an older building that could use some renovating , but which with apparent attention and effort has been well - maintained and is certainly punching above its weight .
		[0.164 0.217 0.234 0.194 0.190]
		as an example , the beds are very comfortable , but the lobby is dated ( if still quite nice ) .
		[0.028 0.076 0.137 0.358 0.402]
		it 's an excellent value , it 's a great location , i would strongly recommend it - but if you 're looking for a cookie - cutter chain environment , or more emphasis on fancy bottles of shampoo and pricey designer bottled water , this is not for you .
		[0.089 0.158 0.211 0.256 0.286]
		the chancellor offers accommodations with some quirks ( both good and bad ) and a bit of personality - precisely what some are looking for in a lodging experience , but not exactly what caters to everyone .

		[0.114 0.175 0.210 0.254 0.248]
		the reception staff were very helpful and offered to look after our luggage during the night , should it arrive , and it did . we had a room at the front of the hotel and if offered great views of the street and cable cars , but the downside was the back ground noise for most of the night .
		[0.072 0.134 0.188 0.302 0.305]

		[0.357 0.274 0.208 0.082 0.079]
		the room transfer was carried out while we were enjoying the sights of san francisco . the hotel is in great location for exploring the city , on the main cable car line for different points on the water front , not to mention the underground , and bus service , and of course the shops . like all hotels in the usa you have no drink making facilities in the room , but next to the bar they seam to have coffee and tea on tap all day , not to mention the cookies in the morning , and fresh pop corn most evenings . in the reception they have information desk so can book all your trips , not to mention the lorries shuttle for the return trip to the airport . we found the hotel very clean and comfortable and would recommend it to everybody . san francisco is great city to visit , it felt very clean and most of all very safe .

		we arrived following a long flight , and a sharp introduction to driving in san francisco ( do not ! ) - we had a simple and very friendly check - in and were straight up to our rooms ( which as we had requested were close together ) .the location is fantastic . . a short walk to the main shopping area , and easy ( right outside the hotel ) cable car connections towards fishermans wharf . the rooms were recently refurbished , and nicely decorated .

		and the nice touch of a pot of sweets was lovely ! coffee/tea were provided in the hotel lobby free - of - charge so you could just help yourself whenever you fancied one - again a nice touch . off - site parking is available on sutter street ( quicker to walk to than drive to ! ) but none - the - less ideally placed .
		[0.059 0.120 0.177 0.334 0.310]

		[0.088 0.152 0.198 0.295 0.267]
		yes , you can open the window , but it does get quite noisy with the cable cars . . . however after the first night i found i could get used the cable car bells , however the emergency services are not quite so quiet ! ! ! loved the little bar in the hotel . . only thing it closed at 9.30pm every night we were there . . . thats pretty early .

		the furniture was clean and the beds were very comfortable with good mattresses and most important of all the bed linen was pristine whitethe bathroom was very clean and well supplied with a few extras like cotton balls and buds and tissues and of course the yellow duck . in the room too we had a small room off , for cases , hanging spaces , an ironing board , umbrella and safe . the tv was good with stacks of channelsand we also had a modern alarm clock into which you could plug your mp player . down stairs you have a lobby , bar and resturant with free tea or coffee and cookies from mid afternoon till evening time . the staff were very friendly ( especially mao in the resturant - a little gem ) and all were very proffesional in they 're jobs . the location of the hotel is a plus point too , being only 250 yards from bart station , overlooking union square with all the best shops you could wish for nearby and a cable car stop outside the hotel .
		[0.065 0.135 0.193 0.282 0.324]

		i can say honestly , hand on heart this establishment is a credit to the city and i would without question recommend it to anyone . read reports in tripadvisor about other hotels - -rip offs , dodgy areas , paperthin walls and torn dirty bed linen - - - you will get nothing like that here - - - what they promise in the brochures is exactly what you get and delivered in a friendly proffesional manner .

		superb amazing hotel in a great location . this hotel should be 4 or 5 stars for the service and the quality of the room , and proves how flawed the whole star system can be as i have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels which have been much worse than this one . firstly the location is second to none .

		[0.002 0.013 0.045 0.408 0.532]
		you are staying right next to all the most expensive hotels , and the most expensive shops and restaurants . to get there from the airport i would advise taking one of the shuttle buses which will cost only $14 plus tip , much cheaper than a taxi . the service throughout the hotel was excellent .
		[0.112 0.177 0.220 0.232 0.258]

		[0.081 0.152 0.207 0.260 0.299]
		would definitely advise booking alcatraz as soon as you get there as it is always booked up during peak season for at least a day , so if you are only staying a couple of days book it before you go there , and if you are staying a week or so , then do it as soon as you get there . the tour bus , located in fishman 's wharf is a good way of seeing the city ( and is close to the place for buying alcatraz tickets ) so i would advise seeing fisherman 's wharf , buying your alcatraz tickets and doing some of the tours on the first day so that you have a good orientation on the city . enjoy ,

		best things going for location are the cable car right outside to take you to more interesting areas such as north beach , russian hill etc . unless you are taking a boat trip , advise staying well clear of fisherman 's wharf ( although sea lions are great fun ! ) as its tacky , packed and does not do san fran justice - much better to hang out in funky neighbourhoods or go to golden gate state park .

		[0.082 0.146 0.194 0.293 0.285]
		we were in room 905 with side on view of union square and newly refurbished - extremely comfortable room and the welcome note , chocs and wine were a really nice touch .
		[0.036 0.091 0.149 0.318 0.406]
		we cannot add too much more to previous reports , the hotel delivers on everything .
		[0.107 0.175 0.218 0.239 0.261]
		it has its own unique personality is so smoothly run that your stay is bound to be perfect but if you do have any queries/issues i am sure that wes and his staff will do whatever they can to resolve them .
		[0.206 0.240 0.235 0.159 0.159]

		the chancellor provided a magical start to our vacation !
		[0.189 0.222 0.230 0.182 0.177]
		after reading reviews on this site , we thankfully booked a room at the chancellor through roomrate . com .
		[0.117 0.183 0.226 0.230 0.244]
		by the positive interaction i had had with wes tyler , who is the hotel 's general manager , and his staff prior to our vacation , i was already certain we were going to have a wonderful stay at the hotel .
		[0.132 0.187 0.217 0.237 0.227]
		we rode bart from sfo to the powell st . station .
		[0.073 0.139 0.192 0.349 0.247]
		we had a bit of an uphill walk on very crowded sidewalks to get to the hotel but it wasn?? too bad . upon check in we were delighted to hear that we had been upgraded to a romance suite .
		[0.211 0.230 0.223 0.181 0.156]
		this was a wonderful start to an amazing vacation .
		[0.176 0.215 0.230 0.190 0.189]
		the lobby of the chancellor is very lovely .
		[0.010 0.041 0.098 0.368 0.483]
		be sure to check out the elaborate crown moldings .
		[0.376 0.269 0.205 0.078 0.072]
		the girl at check in was very welcoming and told us our room would be ready shortly .
		[0.338 0.275 0.212 0.090 0.085]
		the delicious cookies i had read about were awaiting us in the lobby so i used our extra time to try one out - yummy !
		[0.194 0.225 0.222 0.181 0.178]
		we also bought our muni passes right there in the lobby .
		[0.040 0.097 0.158 0.366 0.340]
		soon our room was ready and we rode up the elevator to room 1502.
		[0.331 0.269 0.219 0.094 0.087]
		i want to add here that contrary to some of the posts i had read , although our room was on the 15th floor , we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for an elevator .
		[0.134 0.189 0.216 0.245 0.216]
		we were pleasantly surprised again by the chancellor with a wonderful collection of gifts including a lovely wooden picture frame , chocolates , champagne , glasses and a thoughtful card congratulating us on our 20th anniversary ( thanks wes ! ) .
		[0.064 0.128 0.183 0.351 0.273]
		we were so touched .
		[0.154 0.205 0.220 0.230 0.191]
		the suite was two adjoining rooms that seemed to have been two identical regular rooms at some point .
		[0.213 0.232 0.225 0.179 0.151]
		one had a sofa bed , two chairs , a desk , tv , and a full bath .
		[0.079 0.143 0.193 0.300 0.286]
		the other had a queen size bed , armoire , a 2nd tv , side tables and another full bath !
		[0.118 0.178 0.215 0.261 0.228]
		upon entering the room with the bed , we felt as if we had tiptoed into the twilight zone .
		[0.313 0.269 0.223 0.100 0.094]
		it was so bizarre ; the bed had our same croscill bedding that we have at home !
		[0.272 0.253 0.218 0.134 0.122]
		what are the chances ?
		[0.155 0.208 0.219 0.216 0.201]
		besides this , the print behind the bed is the exact one that i have in my living room here at home .
		[0.316 0.268 0.222 0.105 0.089]
		the armoire was also strikingly similar to ours .
		[0.117 0.179 0.213 0.254 0.238]
		i guess wes and staff really wanted to make us feel at home but i must say it was a little freaky !
		[0.160 0.210 0.235 0.189 0.206]
		it is an old hotel with lots of character .
		[0.022 0.066 0.125 0.369 0.418]
		i loved the enormous arched windows in both rooms as well as the crown moldings and walk in closet .
		[0.059 0.120 0.176 0.318 0.326]
		there were also hard candies and magazines provided in the room which was a nice touch .
		[0.044 0.101 0.159 0.340 0.356]
		both bathrooms had a slight step up to them as well as very deep bathtubs .
		[0.143 0.199 0.220 0.228 0.210]
		although the tubs had handrails , i could see where the bathrooms could be very difficult for anyone with mobility impairments .
		[0.230 0.245 0.235 0.144 0.146]
		the bathroom amenities included swabs , cotton balls , soaps , shampoo/conditioner ( bring your own if like me , you don?? like the mix ) , lotion , bath salts and an adorable rubber ducky ( the ducky can go home with you , i asked ! ) .
		[0.147 0.199 0.219 0.243 0.192]
		the hotel also offered free wireless service in the room which my husband was very happy about .
		[0.102 0.167 0.212 0.242 0.276]
		there was also free internet use in the lobby .
		[0.042 0.099 0.164 0.325 0.369]
		in addition to the cookies , there were apples , coffee and fresh hot popcorn provided each day .
		[0.064 0.127 0.183 0.340 0.286]
		there was also an extensive pillow menu that you could choose from with magnetic , snore stopping , bath and a variety of other pillows .
		[0.071 0.135 0.188 0.325 0.280]
		we found the ones on the bed so comfortable that we did not feel a need to try any others .
		[0.179 0.220 0.234 0.179 0.188]
		the bed was also quite comfortable .
		[0.016 0.055 0.115 0.373 0.440]
		between the armoire , nightstand tables and the deep closet , we had more than enough room to store our belongings .
		[0.184 0.227 0.233 0.176 0.180]
		there was also a safe in the room and a radio with an mp3 hook up .
		[0.137 0.198 0.226 0.202 0.236]
		in the bathroom , there was a spa item menu that you could rent items from .
		[0.114 0.179 0.218 0.239 0.249]
		everything had to be returned by 12:00 the next day .
		[0.382 0.276 0.200 0.074 0.068]
		there was a foot massager , bubble pad , a whirlpool machine and a variety of other items .
		[0.049 0.110 0.168 0.346 0.327]
		i rented the whirlpool machine for my aching legs but it did not seem to work very well , maybe because the tub is so deep .
		[0.120 0.180 0.213 0.263 0.224]
		i let the girt at the desk know this and although i did not ask for it to be done , i noticed i was not charged for it when i checked out . as we entered through the door of our room after exploring the city the first day , there was a strange intermittent blinking red light greeting us .
		[0.204 0.228 0.224 0.187 0.157]
		could it be that we had truly entered the twilight zone ?
		[0.287 0.261 0.215 0.129 0.108]
		as it turns out , there is a very large blinking neon sign for harry denton?? starlight room at the sir francis drake right outside our room !
		[0.074 0.140 0.190 0.326 0.270]
		we pulled the curtains shut which obliterated all but a slight twinkling rosy glow and fell asleep to the ding of the cable cars and the music of the night .
		[0.177 0.224 0.235 0.183 0.179]
		we did not find the light or the outside noise bothersome .
		[0.079 0.144 0.192 0.307 0.278]
		we did have the window closed every night but the ceiling fan provided sufficient cooling .
		[0.159 0.212 0.227 0.207 0.195]
		in case you do not already know , there is no air conditioning in the hotel !
		[0.289 0.259 0.224 0.116 0.112]
		the trolley does stop right outside the hotel , but during our summer stay it was very busy unless it was early in the morning .
		[0.048 0.107 0.167 0.338 0.339]
		there are many bus stops nearby and chinatown , nob hill and north beach are an easy ( although sometimes hilly ) walk .
		[0.064 0.129 0.184 0.338 0.285]
		there are also lots and lots and lots of stores withing walking distance .
		[0.021 0.064 0.124 0.384 0.408]
		we had a view of many of these as well as the square from our window . we did have the pleasure of meeting the celebrated wes tyler during our stay .
		[0.085 0.151 0.197 0.286 0.281]
		he was as nice in person as he seems to be in his responses in the tripadvisor forum .
		[0.208 0.231 0.223 0.180 0.158]
		there was a fire drill planned at the hotel later in the day and although he seemed busy , he still took the time to meet with us .
		[0.297 0.266 0.222 0.107 0.107]
		we thanked him for our spacious room and the thoughtful gifts that were left for us .
		[0.323 0.270 0.208 0.105 0.095]
		all of the staff at the hotel were very friendly and personable throughout our stay .
		[0.038 0.092 0.155 0.319 0.396]
		check out was very simply and quick too . if you are expecting a luxurious , modern , state of the art hotel you will probably be quite disappointed here .
		[0.097 0.167 0.214 0.251 0.270]
		if you are expecting abundant smiles and pleasant service , thoughtful ( and quacking ) amenities , wonderful architectural details in a historic building , and a fantastic location , your expectations will be exceeded !

		perfect hotel to start our honeymoon we had the pleasure of starting our honeymoon at the chancellor hotel as part of our three centre west coast us visit to san francisco , los angeles and las vegas .
		[0.105 0.175 0.220 0.248 0.253]
		i chose the hotel as it was recommended by trailfinders who said their guests loved it , and despite extensive research on the net and tripadvisor i could not see another hotel i would prefer . we arrived at the hotel at 1.30 am after a nightmare 24 hour , 3 flight due to plane delays , journey from the uk (7 hours late ) .
		[0.144 0.197 0.218 0.246 0.195]
		after taking a minibus from the airport we checked in and were warmly welcomed , no queue due to lateness of the hour .
		[0.342 0.272 0.215 0.091 0.079]

		a bottle of wine on ice and a lovely giftwrapped photograph frame were waiting for us due to this being our honeymoon .
		[0.148 0.198 0.220 0.231 0.204]
		i must be in the minority as i did not think our standard room was small at all , average and above average compared to many uk hotel rooms ( it was half as big again as the room we spent our wedding night in , in scotland , although i appreciate many us hotels have larger rooms ) and , given the massive walk - in cupboard with two luggage holders for storing our suitcases and hand luggage , i found the room spacious and not cramped at all .

		stellar service at the chancellor when planning my trip to san francisco , i researched hotels for months .
		[0.094 0.150 0.241 0.276 0.239]
		i chose the chancellor because of location , price , and most importantly , the rave reviews on trip advisor .
		[0.052 0.117 0.182 0.300 0.348]
		not only was i not disappointed , i was totally blown away by the high level of service i received from the entire staff . this was my first time traveling a long distance alone with my 15- year - old daughter ( we 're from the east coast ) , and i was pretty anxious about the trip .
		[0.191 0.231 0.234 0.164 0.181]

		[0.197 0.229 0.241 0.174 0.159]

		[0.173 0.219 0.235 0.190 0.183]
		i requested a quiet room on an upper floor and a refrigerator for my daughter 's insulin .
		[0.051 0.111 0.170 0.340 0.327]
		we were given a corner room on the 14th floor at the back of the hotel .
		[0.067 0.130 0.184 0.302 0.316]
		i found the room size to be perfectly fine .

		the total out - of - pocket cost was over $350!

		i was very shaken and upset .
		[0.198 0.229 0.234 0.163 0.175]
		when i spoke to hotel staff , they immediately offered to buy the insulin for me .
		[0.377 0.272 0.203 0.077 0.071]
		a member of the desk staff , mike , walked with me to walgreens , waited with me while the prescriptions were filled , and paid the pharmacy for the insulin .
		[0.183 0.218 0.223 0.204 0.172]
		while we waited , he was very kind and reassuring .
